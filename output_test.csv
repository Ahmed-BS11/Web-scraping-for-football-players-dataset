31835,Machine learning for functional genomics and protein engineering applications,Such tools can be useful for the assignment of improved functions for orphan genes and sequences for orphan enzymes and for investigating enzyme promiscuity. Hence; there is the potential for the use of new protein language modeling representations using embeddings from natural language. Such improved protein language modeling methods can be valuable for multiple applications including optimizing protein solubility; stability; along with other functional properties of the enzymes such as catalytic activity and affinity. Finally; such protein language modeling methods will be valuable to engineer novel enzymes by combining it with existing experimental techniques such as directed evolution.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology; biochemistry and machine learning. The undergraduate program can be in computer science of engineering and the student will have experience with bioinformatics and genome sequence analysis. The student must be willing to learning techniques and work with senior researchers in order to execute new ideas and algorithms into code and test them out. Finally; the student should be comfortable programming in Python and familiarity with Pytorch and developing code for GPUs.,Biochemistry; Computer Science; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Biomedical; Engg-Biological; Engg-Industrial
31836,Synthetic Biology for Metabolic Engineering of Chemicals from Biomass-based Feedstocks,Further; increased volatility in the petrochemical feedstocks has necessitated a paradigm shift towards the use of biomass based feedstocks for the synthesis of transportation fuels. Consequently; there have been intense academic and corporate research efforts for the design of microbial strains for the production of ethanol; butanol; fatty acid methyl esters and isoprenoids as biofuels. In contrast; there have been very few instances of microbial strain engineering for large-scale commodity chemicals with the exception of 1;3 propanediol (DuPont); lactic acid (Cargill); and 1;4 butanediol (Genomatica). A common feature among all of these chemicals is that they are derived primarily from central metabolism. The success of these efforts clearly motivates the microbial strain engineering efforts for other chemicals which are further removed from central metabolism. Recently; the U.S. Department of Energy identified a dozen chemicals with large market demands globally and in North America that could be potentially synthesized from biomass-based feedstocks. These include dicarboxylic acids such as succinic; malic; fumaric; itaconic and adipic acids as well as levulinic acid. In the case of chemicals that are derived from central metabolism such as succinic acid; malic and fumaric acid; metabolic pathways and enzymes for their synthesis are found in typical industrially used hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However; there still remains the challenge of engineering the metabolism of the microbial host so that volumetric productivity; titer; and product yield can be improved for economic viability. In contrast; for chemicals such as adipic acid; the synthesis pathways are not present in typical industrial hosts resulting in an additional challenge for strain engineering. One of the challenges to developing bioconversion technologies for the production of biochemicals is attaining high conversion efficiency from variable sugar streams. A primary goal is to use systems biology methods to design strains.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Student should be trained in engineering (e.g.; chemical or biochemical engineering) with basic knowledge of biochemistry. He should also know the basics of mathematical modeling and being able to program in MATLAB or Fortran is a plus. Knowledge of bioinformatics is a major plus. Basic experimental skills and interest in learning molecular biology and analytical chemistry tools and other advanced synthetic biology techniques will be a plus.,
31837,Modulating immune response in tumors via nanoparticle drug delivery,Tumor cells secret growth factors; cytokines and chemokines to drive the immune response in the tumor microenvironment towards pro-inflammatory; promoting tumor invasion and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Immuno-modulation of the tumor microenvironment is an attractive strategy for antitumor therapy; but systemic delivery of immunomodulating agents often results in severe side effects. The Li lab plans to develop a nanoparticle system to target an immunomodulating agent to the tumor to re-educate the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that this strategy will reduce the side effects; while exert enhanced anti-tumor immunity.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,1.

31838,Genome editing using non-viral nanoparticle delivery,Gene editing provides an alternative treatment for diseases that cannot be cured by conventional therapies. Those challenging diseases include cancer; genetic disorders; and viral infection. The limiting step for gene editing is efficient delivery of genome editing components into the target cells. The delivery system needs to overcome various barriers and release the biological payloads in the target site. The major delivery barriers include rapid enzymatic degradation; renal elimination; efficient uptake by the target cells and release in the desirable subcellular compartment for optimal effect. The Li lab focuses on developing innovative nanoparticle delivery systems that provide stable and efficient encapsulation of gene editing components and target them to specific cells. Ultimately; these nanoparticles will be used to treat genetic disorders in both in vitro and in vivo models.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,1.

31839,Anti-cancer drug design,This project would involve working on one of our cancer drug design and synthesis campaigns. With our partners; we have identified promising new proteins that could be targeted to treat cancer. We have designed new molecules using structural biology and computational chemistry techniques; and are making many new drugs based on this screen. These often have new ring systems and scaffolds that are not found in the literature and we must invent new chemistry to effectively make them. These drugs are then evaluated by our research team in the lab; and we iteratively redesign; and make new generations of the molecules. The project here is for the organic synthesis. If you have wanted to do synthesis for medicinal chemistry; this is the perfect project for you. Unlike most traditional medicinal chemistry; we are not making a lot of similar analogues; we are generating a few more complex scaffolds which we may then derivatize for standard lead exploration.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,Chemistry
31840,Computational-guided drug design,We are driven by using chemistry to solve questions that arise in biomedicine. This often takes the form of medicinal chemistry where we are looking to make drugs to target specific diseases. As making molecules is expensive; we are using a target-oriented design strategy where we use a combination of structural biology and computational chemistry to study how known molecules interact with a protein target. We are currently using this approach on 7 different targets ranging from new cancer drugs; to autoimmune peptides; to treatments to neutralize antibiotic-resistant bacteria; COVID-19 reasearch; to studying cannabis-protein interactions to better understand the effects of the disease.We then design new molecules based on this information and do computational high-throughput screening to examine which ones we should make in the lab. Computationally; we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations; docking studies; quantum mechanical modelling; and advanced DFT-derived techniques and measurements to understand how molecules interact one with another. We use Gaussian; Amber; Gromacs; Schrodinger; Materials Studio; Rosetta; Autodock Vina and other tools to carry out these analyses. We have extensive supercomputing infrastructure to run these calculations (3600 computer cores); and access to many of the fastest graphics cards for the molecular modelling. The student will be working with the team on one of these projects; all of which have the potential of transforming how we treat disease.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a computational chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The student should have some familiarity with computational chemistry before arriving; but can be taught any of the software they will need. The specific project to be undertaken will be selected both based on the interests and capabilities of the student. Unlike any other MITACS project; the student can continue to collaborate on the science after returning to their home country if they wish. The student will also; ideally; be interested in continuing their studies in graduate school in computational chemistry.,
31841,Macrocyclic Single Molecule Sensors as Diagnostic Tools,We have become very involved in supramolecular chemistry; the chemistry involved when non-covalent bonds provide well-defined structures. We are primarily interested in adapting synthetic chemistry to make previously inaccessible structures with novel activity. This is part of an extensive collaboration with teams in the US; Finland and Switzerland. The project combines developing and using new synthetic organic chemistry with the potential for biophysical and analytical chemistry; or computational and/or materials science training depending on the interests of the applicant. The work will primarily involve the functionalization of aryl groups; post-macrocylization functionalization and elaboration of pillararenes and resorcinarenes. We are then using these for a variety of really neat applications including detecting disease specific molecules (Chemical Science; 2018; 9; 1358-1367); looking to create tools to prevent bacterial growth; and making fundamental discoveries in how molecules form bonds to make large supramoleuclar networks either as crystals (Crystal Growth and Design; 2018; 18; 513-520) or in solution. We are moving into using these systems in live animal models; and in lab-on-a-chip set-ups. The project is a perfect example of our program's philosophy of using synthetic organic chemistry to do more than only total synthesis.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,Chemistry
31842,Functional Polymers: Towards highly targeted traceless drug delivery,Self-immolative polymers are degradable polymers whose decomposition needs to be triggered-they are perfectly stable plastics until a specific stimulus is applied. They are different from traditional biodegradable polymers in that degradation takes place in hours rather than months. Our research team is developing a biocompatible scaffold with a high degree of functionalizability that gives our polymers a unique practical flexibility for use in a wide variety of biomedical applications with our partners including drug delivery; diagnostics; medical device preparation; early cancer detection; and for the development of highly innovative "animal-free" assays. This particular project is focused on novel chemistries that will allow for our biocompatible scaffolds to be used in novel drug-delivery applications. We are working towards producing "unbreachable" nano-particles that are completely stable to all conditions except a single target enzyme that is upregulated in certain cancers. The project involves a combination of synthetic chemistry; materials science; bioimaging; and potentially mammalian tissue culture for a highly interdisciplinary experience. This project is advancing very rapidly in our group; and is a highly innovative and competitive research space; and so the exact project will only be decided upon when the student arrives and we agree upon a subject of mutual interest and relevance.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in functional monomer and polymer synthesis.,
31843,3D bioprinting tissues from stem cells,3D printing uses the specifications provided in a digital file to construct 3 dimensional objects and this process can be applied as a method to engineer tissues. The goal of this project is to use biomaterial-based bioinks to print functional 3D neural tissue from stem cells using 3D bioprinting. In particular; we wish to print tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hiPSCs are pluripotent stem cells produced by reprogramming adult cells back into a state where they can form any type of tissue. hiPSC lines derived from a patient could be printed into tissues used for screening potential treatments for their disease. Proper conditions must be met to ensure the printed hiPSCs form the desired type of tissue. During the printing process; cells are contained in "bioink"; the material that surrounds the cells and enables them to be delivered in continuous streams. This project will bioprint tissues from hiPSCs and evaluate their properties. Such engineered tissues could serve as a tool for drug screening.,Stephanie Willerth,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-06,Stem cell culture experience is preferred. Experience working with chemicals and biohazards along with experience immunohistochemistry; real time PCR; and flow cytometry would also be desirable.,
31844,Analytical chemistry in whisky and/or cannabis science,The Trant group has multiple active collaborations with industrial partners in the wine; whisky; and cannabis fields. The research involves the analysis of components in ingredients; products; and mid-process materials to assist our industrial partners in providing the best possible product with the lowest amount of waste. This research project will involve working directly with our internal analytical chemistry team; and using both internal Trant Team instrumentation and instrumentation located in the Windsor Wine lab (Founding Director: Dr. John Trant) to develop new methodologies to study the levels of cannabinoids; oak-derived flavour compounds in whisky; and wine-flavour compounds and markers of oxidation using HPLC; GC-MS; LC-MS-MS and MS as well as by IR; turbidity; density; and through analysis by refractometry. The research also involves the compiling of reports; discussions with industrial partners; and learning about sample management. The project also could extend; depending on the interests of the candidate; into natural products chemistry; including the development of new non-chromatographic purification methodologies; and some semi-synthesis of standards; or of analogues of known compounds.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for an analytical chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in analytical chemistry (GC-MS; HPLC; and some natural products isolation chemistry).,Chemistry
31845,Acetal-free carbohydrates,Carbohydrates are everywhere. Biology uses them as intermediate duration signals; and their half lives vary from a few hours to almost a day. However; this can often be too short for therapeutics like vaccines. Certain carbohydrates are expressed almost uniquely on the surface of cancer cells. If the immune system could be engaged to target these carbohydrates; it could be used to selectively attack cancer. Unfortunately; natural carbohydrates have failed to elicit such a response. The Trant Team is making unnatural versions of these carbohydrates that lack the acetal linkage and thus have a much longer lifetime in the body. These molecules may be able to succeed where the natural versions have failed. This project is focused on the complicated synthesis of these molecules; the development of new chemistry to attach these non-carbohydrates together; the development of novel display scaffolds to maximize their visibility to the immune system; and the evaluation of these materials for immunologic activity.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,Chemistry
31846,Transforming the Field Education Landscape: Intersections of Research and Practice in Canadian Social Work Field Education,The goal of this talent Project is to integrate research and practice in the preparation of the next generation of social workers by developing partnered research training initiatives; both within academia and across the public and not-for-profit sectors; that enhance student and trainee research practice knowledge and applied skill development. The objectives of the Project are: 1) To transform social work field education by bridging the gap between research and practice through joint training initiatives; projects and other forms of multi-stakeholder engagement and integration; 2) To strengthen the recognition of the importance of social work practice research by enhancing knowledge and skills among students; postdoctoral fellows; and current and future practitioners; 3) To train and mentor students and postdoctoral fellows through new partnered research training initiatives that build the research capacity of the current and future generation of social work scholars; practitioners and policymakers; 4) To support the development of sustainable models of field education through engaging students and postdoctoral fellows in research on promising practices in social work field education across Canada; 5) To engage students and postdoctoral fellows in partnered knowledge mobilization and the multi-directional exchange of knowledge in Canada and internationally on promising practices for sustainable field education and practice research.,JulieDrolet,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,The students are required to have excellent writing and communication skills; an interest in qualitative; mixed methods research; skills in reviewing; compiling and analyzing relevant literature; the ability to work independently or with others; and strong computer skills (Microsoft Word; PowerPoint; Excel; online communication tools). The students will participate in a research team to share the results of the knowledge synthesis with various stakeholders.,Social Work
31847,Soft robot modeling and design,Design a soft robot of interest (hand; dog; etc.) to mimic real anatomy using compliance mechanisms; 3D print it with elastomers; test and improve the design.,Tsz HoKwok,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,CAD; math; solid mechanics; robotics,
31848,Environment modelling and path planning for industrial AGVs,Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are intensively used in many industrial sectors and for numerous and diverse applications. In this context; automated and optimized path planning of AGV has been a very important subject of research for the last years. Automated path planning for AGV starts with modelling the static environment in which the vehicle is likely to move and operate. Various 2D and 3D representations may be applied for modelling such environments; among which point clouds; classical CAD representations; grids; quadtrees; octrees; classical structured and unstructured discretizations; etc. In a second step; the static model of the environment needs to be transformed and adapted for applying classical path planning algorithms. Moreover; modelling the environment needs to be adapted and updated to take into account different types of dynamic obstacles (humans; other automated or human operated vehicles; etc.). The types of models used for representing static and dynamic environments are strongly dependent on the application context (type of environment; type of vehicle; applications and tasks targeted; speed; accuracy required; security issues; etc.). In this context; the research work of our team is focused on developing optimal strategies and methods; in a specific application context; aimed at modelling static and dynamic environments for AGV path planning.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,Background in engineering and computer science. Knowledge in CAD and geometric modelling. Strong interest and knowledge in computer programming. Knowledge of Linux OS and would be considered as a plus.,
31849,Integration of Optimization with Computer Aided Design,The development of Topology Optimization Methods (TOM) in 3D has been a very important subject of research for the last years. These methods are aimed at automating the process of design optimization and thus; they are based on applying analysis iterations on 3D geometries that are automatically modified throughout these iterations. The next step in the development of TOM is its integration within CAD platforms. Ideally the process should start from an initial CAD model along with boundary conditions (BCs) and optimization objectives; and automatically end with an optimized CAD model that fulfills these objectives; all of this without any other user interaction. This integration faces many challenges among which discriminating non-design material (material that should not be affected by the optimization process) and design material (material that is to be affected by the optimization process). We have developed our own TOM research platform and the integration of TOM within CAD uses the FEM for analysis and the SIMP method as the optimization method. Input of the overall optimization process is composed with an initial part; represented as a STEP file (along with BCs) and a second STEP file is used to represent non-design material. From this input data; the optimization process is fully automated and it results in an optimized shape. The SIMP method is used as the optimization method in itself; which is a classical scheme that has been adapted for the context of 3D optimization. It basically updates a density field throughout the initial design domain along FEA iterations in order to generate an optimal material distribution. It is worth noting that this project has a connection with a second project proposed by our team. Indeed; this project is focused on input of the optimization process while the other one is focused on output.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,Background in engineering or computer science. Interest and knowledge in computer programming; 3D geometric modeling and computer aided design. Knowledge of Linux OS and would be considered as a plus.,
31850,Modelling the microstructures of heterogeneous materials,With recent progress about CAD and numerical simulation; studying mechanical and thermal properties of heterogeneous materials can be performed virtually. Numerical simulation of heterogeneous materials is indeed of great interest to the scientific community since it is an attractive and economical solution to the problem of characterizing the thermomechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials. This requires setting up and automating the generation of detailed models of materials microtructures. Our team (équipe de recherche en intégration CAO-Calcul or ERICCA) at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières has developped a platform for that; which is maily based on using solid modelling techniques along with finite element analysis. This platform is originally oriented towards studying heterogeneous particulate materials; but can be applied to all types of microstructures.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,Background in engineering or computer science. Interest and knowledge in computer programming; 3D geometric modeling and computer aided design. Knowledge of Linux OS and would be considered as a plus.,
31851,High-performance practical blockchain systems,This is a multi-faceted project on improving core blockchain components in order to improve its performance. Students will be in charge of investigating one or more aspects of blockchains; formulating novel problems; designing; implementing; and evaluating their solution. The objectives of this project include the following.

Propose new blockchain structures (e.g.; tree) with increased transaction parallelism. 4- Propose a data structure for storing off-chain information; with on-chain verification mechanisms; and a dynamic algorithm for offloading data. 5- Study the effect of networking on blockchain commit time; resilience to attacks; and fork rate. Develop networking protocols for enhanced performance. 6- Create blockchain middleware; delivering reusable services in a reliable and safe manner; such as messaging; identity management; replication; etc.,KaiwenZhang,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Degree in computer science or software engineering Experience in system research; deployment; evaluation Strong programming skills in C++; Java; or Go Familiarity with Ethereum (Solidity); Hyperledger (Fabric and Composer); other blockchain systems; and cryptography,
31853,Structured Derivative-free Optimization,This project will explore method to approximate derivatives; gradient; Hessians; and other variational analysis objects in the framework of derivative-free optimization.

Students should be comfortable with software implementation in MATLAB. Recommended reading "Derivative-free and Blackbox Optimization" by Audet and Hare (2017).,
31854,Anti-aging properties and anti-diabetic properties of cannabis and magic mushroom extracts,The research project focuses on the effect of single cannabinoids; psilocybin; cannabis extracts and extracts of magic mushrooms on aging and metabolic syndrome/diabetes. We are using single cell (skin epithelial cells; fibroblasts; beta-cells); 3D tissue (full sickness skin tissues) and animal (mice) models to analyze the effect of aforementioned treatments. We will induce aging with the exposure to hydrogen peroxide; UVC or high glucose/high lipid addition. We will induce metabolic pre-diabetic effects by exposing cells/tissues/animals to high fat/high sugar diet. We will then test the induction of conditions by analyzing the cell survival; cell morphology; RT-PCR and Western blots and then treat with various formulations of aforementioned drugs. We will evaluate the results and select specific formulations for animal studies.,IgorKovalchuk,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-20,The student should have completed at least 2; preferably 3 years of studies in molecular biology; biochemistry or pharmacology. It is preferred that the student has worked in the lab before and has general lab skills; but this is not an absolute requirement.,Biological Sciences; Biochemistry; Molecular Biology; Pharmacology
31855,Investigating the structure and function of regulators of the human autophagy degradation pathway,Autophagy is a multi-step degradation process that involves sequestration of cytoplasmic material into a transport vesicle called the autophagosome and the subsequent fusion of this autophagosome to the lysosome where the contents would be degraded by digestive enzymes inside this cellular "incinerator". The different steps of autophagy are mediated by a specialized suite of autophagy regulatory proteins and protein complexes. The proposed research project focuses on a human autophagy factor known as EPG5. EPG5 has been proposed to mediate the specific fusion between the autophagosome and the lysosome but the mechanism of action of EPG5 is not fully understood. Clinical genetics studies revealed that mutations to the gene encoding EPG5 causes a severe multi system disorder known as Vici syndrome. Although many of these mutations have now been mapped; how these genetic alterations affect the function of EPG5 is not known. The Yip laboratory recently developed a high-yield method to isolate pure EPG5 and this has enabled more comprehensive biochemical and molecular characterization of this very large-sized (~290kDa) protein. The proposed project will harness this powerful experimental platform and will specifically focus on examining the effects of various Vici syndrome disease mutations on the biochemical property and function of EPG5 using protein biochemistry; biophysical; and cell biology approaches.,CalvinYip,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The candidate must be enrolled in a Bachelor’s of Science program in biochemistry; and other related life sciences or biological sciences disciplines with solid academic standings. Strong communication and organization skills; eagerness to learn new experimental techniques; and attention to detail are also required. The ideal candidate would have strong interests in pursuing a career in research and have plans to pursue graduate studies in the future.,Biochemistry; Biological Sciences; Immunology; Medical Sciences; Molecular Biology
31856,Ethnographic dimensions of human-carnivore coexistence in northern Tanzania,The research explores local people’s lived experiences of wildlife conservation in northern Tanzania; with attention to livelihood practices; land use change; attitudes towards species and protected areas; socioeconomic impacts of human-wildlife conflict; and strategies for promoting coexistence. Data includes interviews and surveys and is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.,JustinRaycraft,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-07-01,These internships are most suitable for students with backgrounds in social sciences or ecology.

The quantitative intern should be proficient with social science and/or ecological statistical analyses and may have a background in sociology; economics; ecology; conservation biology; or related fields.,
31857,Improving Quantum Efficiencies in Plasmonic Photocatalysts,Surface plasmons are quantum quasiparticles describing the coherent and collective oscillations of conduction band electrons at a metal-dielectric interface. Surface plasmons can be stimulated by light to either form propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) or localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) depending on the material geometry employed. The coherent oscillations constituting plasmons are "damped" in femtoseconds by various processes to generate electron hole pairs with a non-equilibrium distribution of kinetic energies (i.e. hot carriers). The hot carriers relax to equilibrium in picoseconds through a variety of scattering and collision processes. The goal of this project is to get the plasmonic hot carriers to perform useful work with their excess energy before they relax to equilibrium. One form of useful work involves the plasmons driving a chemical reaction; which is more formally known as plasmonic catalysis. Another form of useful work involves applying plasmons to perform ultrafast photodetection in specific spectral range. The following published articles provide a flavor of the type of work this project involves: (i) https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ab814c (ii) https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/ab4554 (iii) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118644 (iv) https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c21067 The project is highly interdisciplinary and involves application of concepts from electromagnetics; semiconductor physics; laser physics; catalysis; chemical reaction engineering; heat transfer; materials science; mechanical design and spectroscopy. The best plasmonic catalysts are nanostructured heterojunctions consisting of semiconductors in contact with plasmonic materials. The typical plasmonic materials used in this project are gold; silver and transition metal nitrides such as TiN; HfN; ZrN; etc. The semiconductors used by the Shankar Lab are chalcogenides (CdS; CdSe; Cu2S; etc); 2D materials (nitrogen-doped graphene; carbon nitrides) and wide bandgap metal oxides (TiO2; ZnO; Nb2O5; Ta2O5; etc).,KarthikShankar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-06,The ideal student has a strong background in solid-state physics; electromagnetics and materials science. Prior research experience in at least one of the following four areas is a must: (i) Lasers & electromagnetics (ii) Nanomaterials synthesis & characterization (iii) Advanced spectroscopy (iv) DFT/FDTD modelling. The single most important attribute is the ability to "Figure Things Out For Oneself" - including a practical bent of mind; critical thinking and a curiosity toward advanced optical & electronic toys. Another key skill is the ability to read and understand the gist/concept of scientific papers in a short time.,

The student will be trained in animal handling and in performing; analysing; and reporting results of behavioural test in rats. These test include acoustic startle responses; locomotor activity; and different learning tests. Depending on the interest of a student; training in some of the histological/immunohistochemical methods; including image analysis with a confocal microscope and respective software; or using an AI algorithm; is an option. Students with a background in coding and/or interest in AI will also have an opportunity to analyze a large data set of MALDI data using special software.,SusanneSchmid,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-05-01,Ideally; the student has a background in neuroscience; or in biology or psychology with a strong interest in neuroscience and neuronal mechanisms. The student needs to be able to communicate in English and needs to be comfortable with the idea of handling rats. Some background with coding and/or handling large data sets would be an asset. A strong interest in performing research is essential.,Biological Sciences; Medicine; Neuroscience; Physiology; Zoology
31859,Bioconversion of crude glycerol into valuable biohydrogen _Clone,In February 2011; the federal government announced that all diesel sold in Canada must be made up of two per cent biodiesel. With the new standards in place; 600 million liters of biodiesel per year would be needed in Canada. Taking into account the stoichiometric amounts of glycerol generated (about 10% by weight) during transesterification; about 60 million liters of glycerol would be produced. Despite innumerable pharmaceutical; food and other uses known for glycerol; a large (and increasing) fraction is incinerated or stored as excess in an already saturated market. A typical glycerol stream contains a mixture of glycerol with methanol; water; inorganic salts (catalyst residues); free fatty acids; unreacted mono-; di-; and triglycerides; methyl esters; and a variety of other “matter organic nonglycerol” (MONG) in varying amounts (Behr et al.; 2008). In the coming years; there will be a net increase in the biodiesel production contributing to large volumes of glycerol being produced. High volumes of glycerol-byproduct present a challenge and urgent need to develop new methods for sustainable glycerol management. Developing new industrial uses for glycerol in its turn will greatly increase the net energy and sustainability of biodiesel. In fact; glycerol is moving from the position of “additive” to that of starting material (platform). Possibilities such as combustion; co-burning; composting; animal feeding; thermochemical conversions and biological conversion have been applied for crude glycerol processing (Feng et al; 2010; Valliyappan et al; 2008; Freitas et al; 2010; Yoon et al; 2010; Hájek and Skopal; 2010; Zamzow et al; 2007; Bodík et al; 2009).

31860,Oleaginous Yeast-Based Advanced Platform for Drop-in Fuel Feedstock Production from Forest Residues,Canada has the third richest forest resource in the world; which contributes to its major gross domestic product (GDP). This also opens an opportunity to strengthen Canada's bio-based economy; as there are still unexploited routes for forest residue utilization in the bioenergy sector. In the past decade; Canada has witnessed prominent growth in the renewable fuel sector. In addition; there is also a growing interest in the production of advanced biofuels; such as drop-in fuel; which can act as an alternative to petroleum based fuel without having a blending barrier as needed for bioethanol and biodiesel. The present project aims to develop a metabolically engineered oleaginous yeast based platform through a multidisciplinary approach for efficient production of advanced biofuel; alkane (called drop-in biofuel) from wood based lignocellulosic feedstock. The project will address several bottlenecks in the use of wood based feedstock for biofuel production; such as efficient utilization of lignocellulosic sugars; inhibitor management; and optimized process development; for efficient production of drop-in fuels. In 10 years; the technology developed in the project will serve as model for the production of various other biofuels through oleaginous yeast based platform. Through innovative research methodology and close collaboration with the industry; the project will develop a robust technology and train HQP in the field of biochemistry; molecular biology; biotechnology; biochemical engineering; for the benefit of the Canadian bioenergy and renewable forest biomass sector.

31861,Fate and removal of emerging contaminants from wastewaters and sludges in wastewater treatment plants,The wastewater treatment plants have undergone a sea change in the last three decades in terms of new add-ons for further removal of toxic pollutants to ensure a clean effluent. Despite the advanced modifications and improved appurtenances; there have been reports of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-furans (PCDFs); endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs) pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) residuals in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Meanwhile; the existing wastewater treatment processes are not designed to handle these toxic compounds especially at the levels (µg/l; ng/l or pg/l) in which they reach the WWTPs. Thus; even after treatment; the trace levels of the precursor compound remain or may get transformed into other innocuous metabolites; especially in wastewater sludge where they can get accumulated due to adsorption or locking in the sludge flocs and end up in landfills and incinerators. The specific objectives of the research proposal are as follows: (1) occurrence; transformation; and distribution of selected toxic organic compounds; namely; PPCPs (ibuprofen; sulfamethoxazole; carbamazepine; diclofenac; naproxen; ketoprofen; gemfibrozil; benzafibrate; fluoxetine; trimethoprim) and metabolites in different WWTPs of Quebec will be carried out ; (2) if the selected compounds are not present in significant concentration; other potential EDCs and PPCPs will also be screened. Subsequently; samples with higher potential will be subjected to rigorous analysis for individual target compounds; (3) In parallel to the objective 1 and 2; a comprehensive method for analytical analysis especially; pre-concentration and sample clean-up will be developed on the extraction of different toxic organic compounds from a complex matrix such as; wastewater sludge.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-06,The student will be required to have a general chemistry background as the research project involves environmental samples analysis and sampling.

31862,Novel enzyme based biosystems for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated sites,Given the recent accidents in Canada; it is clear that developing new tools for treatment of oil spills becomes necessary to develop new treatment tools that provide fast results preventing further economical consequences and destruction of soil and water. One promising approach to overcome this challenge is the use of enzymatic systems able to react with these molecules. Among the possible enzymes; oxidative enzymes are attractive and receiving increasing attention because of their versatility; the possibility to produce them on large scale; and to modify their properties. In the last decades; many efforts were focused on developing different microbial cultures that could be used to mitigate or remediate the effects of such accidents. The present project proposes to deal with this environmental issue by using enzymes optimizedunder conditions of solid state fermentation. Recovery of the desired enzymes; study their efficiency under different environmental conditions; such as soil pH and temperature will be important. Later; a chitosan nano-coating will be developed to enhance enzymes efficiency under unfavorable conditions. This research project will provide a new technology with a broad spectrum of action based on eco-friendly molecules which will produce less toxic secondary compounds than the existing treatments helping to improve the environmental quality for Canadians at a lower cost. As an estimation; the treatment of the 11 km2 of Lac Megantic accident with 200ml per m2 and $157 /L would have a final cost of around $345M with a final cost; which is much lower than the actual price estimated running in several billion dollars. Likewise; the development of advanced environmental technologies for the treatment of oil spills will offer potential growth opportunities to the existing nanotechnology based industries placing Canada as an avant-garde nation for protection of environment.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have a general chemistry background as the research project involves environmental samples analysis and sampling and designing enzymatic methods.

31863,An integrated solid state fermentation approach for production of enzymes from agro-wastes,One third of the total apple production in Canada (447;035 ton/year) is processed to produce juices; flavours and concentrates and Quebec has 32 % share (2007 statistics) in it. The end result is a solid residue containing high moisture content (70%–75%) and biodegradable organic load (high BOD and COD values). These wastes have low nutritional value and their high biodegradability causes environmental problems. A typical apple processing industry generates 25%–30% apple pomace and 5%–11% sludge (liquid waste obtained after clarification). Apple pomace consists mainly of apple skin/flesh (95%); seeds (2%–4%) and stems (1%). Apple pomace; including seeds; contains polyphenolics. These natural anti-oxidants are high in demand owing to their role as a free radical scavenger; in a number of degenerative diseases; such as cancer and atherosclerosis. The recovered antioxidants from apple pomace could be used as a nutraceutical and a food supplement. In this context; the proposed project investigates the use of apple pomace as a raw material for production of high value added products such as; polyphenols along with other products; namely lignolytic enzymes (principally laccases) and left over fermented residue as animal feed in aquaculture farms. Phanerochaete chrysosporium; a white rot fungus; will be utilized for the solid state fermentation of apple pomace. The principal objective is as follows: * Solid state fermentation of apple pomace to produce lignolytic enzymes; namely laccases: this will involve optimization of moisture content; fermentation time; pH and temperature for the growth of lignolytic enzymes using statistical techniques. The produced enzymes will be extracted by using buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration and later transformed into liquid or solid formulations for use in pulp and paper industry and also for degradation of toxic organic compounds; so finding use in seafood processing wastewater treatment; municipal wastewater treatment and bioremediation of soils.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have a general chemical/biochemical engineering/biotechnology background as the research project involves bioproduction of enzymes using agro-wastes by solid state and liquid fermentation.

31864,Learning in virtual reality: humans vs artificial neural networks,The aim of this project is to create a Virtual Reality (VR) environment for comparing learning dynamics in humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can create a naturalistic three-dimensional experience for humans; while allowing researchers to control every aspect of the visual and motor experience. This makes it an ideal platform for examining learning capabilities and dynamics in humans; as well as comparing them with learning algorithms used in today's AI models. The project will involve developing a VR experimental platform and implementing a visuomotor task; such as visually guided self-movement control; for human participants. Participants will be trained and tested on the task over multiple days; and their performance and improvement will be monitored and recorded. The same environment will be used for training and testing deep ANNs; and their performance metrics will be measured and compared with those of the human participants. The project will investigate whether humans and ANNs go through the same learning dynamics by observing and comparing their behavioral metrics and movement trajectories through the environment. The effect of unexpected events on the learning dynamics of humans and ANNs will also be measured. This project provides an opportunity for student interns to work on an exciting area of research in cognitive computational neuroscience; contribute to the development of an innovative VR platform; and gain hands-on experience in designing and conducting experiments; analyzing data; and comparing ANNs with human performance.,ShahabBakhtiari,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,The student should be comfortable working with python.

The experiments will focus on perceptual tasks; such as shape and form perception; motion perception; and texture discrimination. The online platform will also allow us to evaluate deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) on the same tasks and compare their learning trajectories with humans. To achieve this; the project will involve developing the online platform; implementing and testing experimental tasks on human participants; training and testing ANNs on the same tasks; and creating online tools for comparing ANNs side by side with humans. Overall; this project will provide an opportunity for student interns to work on an exciting area of research in cognitive computational neuroscience; contribute to the development of an innovative online platform; and gain hands-on experience in designing and conducting experiments; analyzing data; and comparing ANNs with human performance.

31866,Excitonic processes in organic and hybrid solar cells,Organic solar cells remain an intriguing technology for flexible photovoltaic panels on curved surfaces such as vehicle roofs and building facades. This project aims to advance the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE of organic photovoltaics by better understanding excitonic processes in organic and hybrid solar cells. Due to the low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors; the Coulombic interaction between electrons and holes is poorly screened resulting in a bound quasiparticle called an exciton (specifically a Frenkel exciton). At a donor-acceptor heterojunction with the right energetics; the Frenkel exciton typically transforms to a less tightly bound charge transfer exciton (also known as an exciplex). The exciplex is still different from the Mott-Wannier excitons encountered in inorganic semiconductors. This project seeks to use clever device design; creative optoelectronic characterization and advanced spectroscopy to better understand excitonic quasiparticles and their dynamics in new semiconductor heterojunctions involving 2D semiconductors; plasmons; quantum dots; carbon nitrides; etc. The following published journal articles will provide a flavor of the type of research pursued: (i) https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b18197 (ii) https://doi.org/10.3390/polym9020035 (iii) https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b00144 (iv) https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TC05054F,KarthikShankar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-06,This project requires a strong foundation in BASIC SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS; and some knowledge of microfabrication processes such as vacuum deposition; photolithography; physical and chemical etching; etc. The single most important attribute is the ability to "Figure Things Out For Oneself" - including a practical bent of mind; critical thinking and a curiosity toward advanced optical & electronic toys.Prior experience in materials characterization and/or solar cell fabrication & testing is highly desirable but not essential. A high comfort level with organic and inorganic chemistry would be an added bonus that will increase the probability of the student's success in this project.,
31867,Supportive Neighbourhoods for People with Dementia,Persons living with dementia (PLWD) often report that they experience a shrinking world; both physically and socially; with the onset of their disease. Providing a supportive neighbourhood environment for those living with dementia in a community context is often recognised as a cost-efficient strategy to support independence; as well as the preferred choice for older adults living with dementia. There is a growing interest in examining the neighbourhood environment for its role in influencing levels of social participation (i.e.; involvement in a life situation (World Health Organization; 2001; p. 127)) and activities in later life (Chaudhury et al.; 2016; Richard et al.; 2009; Rosso et al.; 2011; World Health Organization; 2015). The neighbourhood also acts as a source of emotional and practical support for persons living with dementia with opportunities for building social networks; maintaining independence; and fostering a sense of attachment (Keady et al.; 2012; Odzakovic et al.; 2018). Availability of destinations and amenities in the community can facilitate healthy aging by supporting older adults’ functional abilities and enabling their participation in society; especially for those experiencing declining cognitive; mental; social and physical capacities (World Health Organization; 2015). However; there is scarce empirical evidence on the built environmental features that constitute supportive neighbourhood environments for persons with dementia. The Project Objectives are: 1) identify neighbourhood destinations that PLWD visit and changes in the patterns of visits over time; 2) identify neighbourhood built environmental features that affect mobility; engagement and social participation among PLWD; 3) develop an easy-to-use environmental audit and advocacy tool to conduct descriptive and evaluative assessment of the neighbourhood environment supportive of PLWD; 4) develop planning and design guidelines to inform decision-makers; such as municipal policymakers; city planners; urban designers and engineers in the creation of a dementia-inclusive neighbourhood environment;,HabibChaudhury,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,Excellent written and verbal skills Experience in writing academic papers Skills in qualitative research methods Background in social sciences/health sciences/planning and design Ability to work effectively with team,
31868,Physical Environmental Assessment in Long-Term Care Facilities,The physical environment is a critical component of a supportive long-term care facility for people with dementia. There is substantial evidence that has identified the effect of unsupportive physical environments that contribute to common challenging behaviours in people with dementia; e.g.; spatial disorientation; anxiety; agitation; social withdrawal; etc. Unsupportive environmental features in residential care settings contribute to spatial disorientation; anxiety and agitation among residents with dementia (Chaudhury et al.; 2018; Chaudhury & Cooke; 2014; Chaudhury et al.; 2016; Chaudhury et al.; 2013). These environments include features such as long hallways; large dining rooms; shared bedrooms; high noise levels; institutional lighting; etc. Conversely; a well-designed supportive physical environment has been shown to foster positive behaviours; such as reduced agitation; increase in social contact; less dependence in conducting activities of daily living; etc. (Chaudhury et al.; 2018; Chaudhury & Cooke; 2014; Chaudhury et al.; 2016; Chaudhury et al.; 2013). Supportive environmental features include small household; homelike kitchen; cluster design with no hallways; positively designed outdoor spaces; etc. There is a need for developing assessment tools to systematically measure the physical environmental features supporting the quality of life for people with dementia in long-term care facilities.The goal of this project is to pilot test a physical environmental assessment instrument; named Person Oriented Environment Tool (POET) in dementia care units of 8-10 residential care facilities within Metro Vancouver. The research instrument assesses the quality of physical environmental features in the care setting that are supportive/unsupportive of residents’ behaviours and social interactions.,HabibChaudhury,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,Interested in the field of Environmental Gerontology (Aging & Environment) and understanding the quality of life for people living with dementia.

31870,Model Predictive Control of Batch Processes,Batch processes constitute a class of processes that play an important role in the production and processing of a wide range of value-added products (i.e.; chemical; pharmaceuticals; bio-chemicals; etc.). They are finite duration processes with unique characteristics; such as the absence of equilibrium points and nonlinear and time-varying dynamics over a wide range of operating conditions; that preclude the direct application of control strategies designed for continuous systems. Unlike continuous systems; which are characterized by control at an equilibrium point; the primary control objective in batch processes is to reach a specified product quality by batch termination. The economic benefits from batch processing are realized from the consistent production of on-spec product. Direct control to the specified quality; however; is impractical in most cases because quality measurements are unavailable online and only made offline after batch completion. Motivated by the above considerations; in this thesis we will develop a within-batch quality control strategy for batch processes. The method will be tested on several processes. Significant industrial interaction is expected.

These contaminants are a problematic issue in Québec and Canada where the economy primarily revolves around (i) forestry; with residues disposed of in open-air sites leading to leachates rich in contaminating phenolic compounds; and (ii) mining; where large concentrations of SO2 can be found in areas with mining and smelting activities. These contaminants pose a severe threat to human health and the environment. Thus; in the longer term; this research will contribute to realizing a circular economy with significant societal benefits.

31880,Environmental impacts of dam breaks,The main risk commonly associated with a dam is its failure and rapid flooding of the downstream land; with the associated risk of life and property loss; including damage to infrastructure and environmental aspects; as debris; mud; and other substances contained in the reservoir; such as in the case of mining tailings; are released downstream and may cause severe environmental impacts. The research program aims to develop a comprehensive analysis framework for the environmental impacts of dam breaks; creating a comprehensive indicator set that will greatly enhance the reliability of the assessment results. Special attention will be given to mining tailings; given the large number of mining operations in Canada; and the usually hazardous nature of the wastes stored within tailings. Environmental impact indicators associated with the spill of wastes from tailings will be included in the analysis framework. Environmental impacts will be quantified by considering the economic value associated with the damages; such as loss of ecosystem services. Hydraulic analysis software will be combined with Geographical Information Systems to create a tool that will synthesize the analysis framework developed. First Nations communities have suffered extensive impacts associated with the construction of dams; usually due to the communities being relocated from their original lands. When their relocation sites are in the valleys potentially affected by a dam break; they are likely to suffer yet more impacts. Therefore; special attention will be given to the effects of dam breaks on these communities; which usually rely on the environment to survive. A Virtual Reality environment for dam breaks will be developed.

One potential application is the use of EEG-assisted operator performance monitoring; which will provide real time and precise assessment of human performance and link to operation activities. The analysis technique will map human brain signals to behavior and activities; which will be translated into human behavior assessment to improve operation performance and safety.,
31886,Effects of Cannabis on the Developing Brain,Our goal is to quantify the effects of Cannabis and Alcohol; alone and in combination; on brain structure and function. Because of the high susceptibility of the hippocampus to alcohol as a teratogen; and the high density of cannabinoid receptors found in the hippocampus; we hypothesize that combined exposure will dramatically affect neuronal structure and function in this region. Because both alcohol and cannabis have sex specific effects; we hypothesize the effects will be more prominent in males; and compounded by combined use.,BrianChristie,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,Basic biochemistry/biology/histology skills are preferred. Individuals with electrophysiology; microscopy; biochemistry; or immunohistochemistry experience are encouraged to apply.,Biochemistry; Biological Sciences; Biology; Medical Sciences; Medicine; Neuroscience; Physiology; Psychology
31887,Understanding Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,Concussions are a form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); often called the “unseen injury”; because of the lack of obvious damage. As a result; many individuals suffer repeated concussions; often in short time spans. In some sports; like hockey and football; awareness is growing that repeated sub-concussive blows to the head are routinely incurred in practices and games. Although many of these impacts do not result in a diagnosis of concussion; there is a growing appreciation that both concussions and sub-concussive impacts can negatively impact cognitive function in the developing brain; and that repeated concussions (r-mTBI) can have long-term detrimental effects for cognition in elderly populations. Despite these concerns; few laboratories have systematically studied r-mTBI in a preclinical model that properly mimics the human condition. We have recently developed a model that enables us to accurately examine r-mTBI and understand how the brain responds to repeated mTBI. Because significant structural damage does not occur in mTBI; our focus is on whether there is damage to small blood vessels in the brain. These vessels are below the threshold of resolution for magnetic resonance imaging; but can be resolved using high resolution microscopy. When damaged; these vessels can release a compound in the blood called fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is normally important for clotting; but can also initiate an inflammatory process involving brain microglia that negatively impacts neurons; and impairs learning and memory processes. The results of the proposed work will help us to better understand the mechanisms involved in mTBI; how they directly impact brain function; and increase our understanding of how r-mTBI early in life could negatively impact individuals as they age. More importantly; this work will enable us to determine the therapeutic value of modulating fibrinogen’s effects in the brain to help reduce the negative impact of r-mTBI on cognition.,BrianChristie,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,Basic biochemistry/biology/histology skills are preferred. Individuals with microscopy; biochemistry; or immunohistochemistry experience are encouraged to apply.,
31888,Control of American foulbrood and spread of antimicrobial resistance in beekeeping industry,American foulbrood (AFB) caused by Paenibacillus larvae is a devastating brood disease of honey bees. In addition to various integrated pest management practices; antibiotics are often used to control this diseases in North American commercial beekeeping operations. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of P. larvae has been documented in honey bee colonies in Saskatchewan; however; little is known about the prevalence; distribution and potential spread of AMR P. larvae strains in Saskatchewan. This multifaceted research program employs a combination of investigation of clinical outbreaks; surveillance and molecular epidemiology of AFB as well as various bacteriology and molecular biology approaches to enhance antimicrobial stewardship in the Canadian beekeeping industry by judicious and evidence-based antibiotic therapy applied in apiculture based on scientific risk assessment.,ElemirSimko,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-20,Student must not be allergic to bee stings. Student has to be eager to learn and perform regular beekeeping tasks in our research apiary; this include working outside during hot days and performing physical workload as required. Accordingly; physical fitness is required. No prior beekeeping experience is needed.,Veterinary Science and Medicine; Microbiology; Entomology; Ecology; Biology; Biological Sciences; Agriculture
31889,Identification of novel ectonucleotidase inhibitors,Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) and other ectonucleotidases are enzymes that hydrolyze nucleotides at the cell surface. These nucleotides affect various biological functions via the activation of nucleotide (P2) receptors. To state a few examples; we observed that inflammatory processes; cancer; thrombosis and bone formation (in bone diseases) are all affected by the activity of these enzymes. In collaboration with chemists specialized in nucleotide research from Israel; Pakistan; USA and Germany we have developed several inhibitors of these enzymes. These inhibitors are synthetized with the medium term goal to regulate the above biological functions (each being specific for a single ectonucleotidase). Before testing these novel molecules on ectonucleotidase activity we will express the recombinant form of each of these enzymes in a mammalian expression system (such as COS-7) and partially purify these enzymes. The expression level and activity of these prepared proteins will be confirmed and evaluated by Western blot and activity assays. The novel potential inhibitors will be tested for potency and specificity on each of these ectonucleotidases for the identification of both general inhibitors and specific inhibitors. It is also possible that some of the best inhibitors will be tested in the relevant biological assays with mice; and/or human or mice primary cells. This project is designed for both: develop tools for basic research and develop/test molecules for a potential clinical application.,JeanSévigny,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,Background in biochemistry; cell culture and enzymology in both theory and practice would help.,Biochemistry; Molecular Biology; Engg-Biomedical; Immunology; Microbiology; Pharmacology
31890,Development of a new treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, Colitis),According to the trainee's interest; up to 3 trainees can work on some of the 4 aspects below. 1) Determine if and how the blockade of the P2Y receptors in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) prevents inflammation in 2 mouse models of mucosal inflammation that most resemble human IBD; i.e.; the adoptive T cell transfer model of colitis and the Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) models. We will intra-rectally administer different types of blockers of the P2 receptors expressed at the surface of IECs; such as a scavenger of general P2 receptor ligands (apyrase) or specific antagonists of P2Y1; P2Y2 and P2Y6; and determine their impact on the inflammatory responses in these 2 IBD models. In the DSS model we will also use deficient mice for these receptors and use bone marrow transplantation experiments to discriminate a role of the receptors expressed on both leukocytes and IECs. Preliminary results with the DSS model show that engagement of both P2Y2 and P2Y6 receptors in IECs lead to the inflammation. 2) Define molecular mechanisms by which P2Y receptors control intestinal inflammation using primary IECs from WT mice as well as from P2Y2 and P2Y6 KO mice. We will focus on examining the synthesis and release of cytokines as well as cell permeability. These experiments will also be performed with IECs purified from healthy sections of the colon from human patients. 3) Engineer a soluble form of NTPDase8 as a potential treatment for IBD; and test it in the IBD mouse models detailed above. 4) Test new P2Y receptor antagonists developed for application in humans; as a potential treatment for IBD; using the IBD mouse models detailed above.,JeanSévigny,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,Background in pharmacology; biochemistry; cell culture; mouse models; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); in both theory and practice would help but are not mandatory.,
31891,Optimization and Machine Learning for Smart Mobility,The availability of large amounts of data from a wide range of origins in addition to the rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); including those in smart cities; cloud computing; big data analytics; and machine learning; can modernize transportation network into a smart sustainable mobility system. This project aims to build a decision making platform for personal mobility or last-mile delivery by implementing and analyzing different prediction methods to detect mobility patterns of commuters in a given region and optimizing over these patterns to achieve a more sustainable transportation system. The project will consist of three components: (1) harvesting various data sources (e.g. social media; city sensors; transportation operator data etc.); (2) using machine learning on the integrated data in order to build mobility patterns and analyze travel demand; (3) developing a decision making tool that relies on mathematical optimization models in order to design a sustainable transportation system by offering a seamless experience through improved services adapted to users’ specific needs taking into account the overall traffic flow. The result of this project will lead to improved mobility and travel conditions for users and will have an impact on the environment by reducing traffic related pollution.,BissanGhaddar,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,Required Skills: - Proficient programming skills in a high-level language such as Python or C - Basic knowledge of linear algebra; probability; and statistics Additional Preferred Skills: - Knowledge of machine learning algorithms and tools - Knowledge of optimization models - knowledge in reinforcement learning,Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Industrial; Engg-Software; Engineering; Mathematics
31892,Extraction of high value products from by-products of marine processing,The by-product of marine biomass processing (finfish; shellfish; algae etc) can make up to 70wt% of the landed product. This waste has value and can be transformed into; fertilizers; nutritional products; pharmaceutical; materials etc. The key is to develop green processes what transform this material with zero waste generation and minimal energy requirements. This project will focus on rockweed (a seaweed) to further characterize the material and work with graduate students on developing green processes to extarct or convert the material to product that benefits the region. This will build on existing work in supercritical extraction and hydrothermal carbonization.,KellyHawboldt,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-01,Ideally chemical engineer with courses in transport phenomena; chemical engineering thermodynamics; and mass/energy balances.

31893,Reliability in Machine Learning,The student working on this project will join the team of graduate and undergraduate students working on malware analysis; identification; and ML reliability approaches. Our earlier work demonstrated an easy yet disruptive attack on an ML-based classifier for software systems that does not require any knowledge of classifier internals and the features that it uses; i.e.; could be easily performed by any attacker. The attack also demonstrated the need for more robust malware detection classifiers – a direction we explore in the current project. Our work relies on techniques from the fields of program analysis; ML; and Large Language Models (LLM) for code.,JuliaRubin,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The student is expected to: - have solid programming experience and good command of Java; C++; C; or a similar language; - be able to learn new programming languages and frameworks; - have deep understanding of a variety of machine learning techniques; - have deep understanding of algorithms and data structures; - have a good understanding of mobile application environments (at least as an informed mobile user); - be detail-oriented and thorough. Additional desirable skills (optional): - experience with program analysis and mobile analysis frameworks (such as soot or asm).,
31894,Mobile Application Analysis,This project focuses on developing better defense mechanisms for identifying such malware using application analysis and ML-based techniques. The student working on this project will join the team of graduate and undergraduate students working on malware testing and analysis; and ML reliability approaches. One current direction of this work is identifying applications that exhibit malicious behavior only under a set of complicated and specific conditions; e.g.; at a certain time or at a certain location. Such malicious behaviors; typically referred to as logic and time bombs; are difficult to detect in practice: testing-based approaches often fail to efficiently identify inputs that trigger these behaviors. To continue our existing work; we focus on developing a novel application analysis framework for identifying logic and time bombs in an efficient manner. We are also exploring approaches for identifying malware that downloads and executes it malicious content on a command obtained from a third-party command-and-control server. Finally; this project focuses on efficient mobile application testing techniques that enable dynamic-analysis-based approaches.,JuliaRubin,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The student is expected to: - have solid programming experience and good command of Java; C++; C; or a similar language; - be able to learn new programming languages and frameworks; - have solid understanding of algorithms and data structures; - have good understanding of mobile application environments (at least as an informed mobile user); - be detail-oriented and thorough. Additional desirable skills (optional): - experience with program analysis and mobile analysis frameworks (such as soot; asm; or llvm); - experience with machine learning techniques.,
31895,Security in Microservice-based Applications,Vulnerabilities are flaws in computer systems; including microservice-based applications; weaken the system security. An example is the recent Log4j exploit; which enabled attackers to execute malicious code on millions of victim machines. It has affected numerous services including those of Amazon and Cisco. To help address this challenge; the main goals of this project are to develop approaches for (a) identifying faults and security vulnerabilities in microservices and (b) decomposing monolithic applications to secure-by-design microservice-based systems.,JuliaRubin,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The student is expected to: - have solid programming experience and good command of Java; JavaScript; Python; or a similar language; - be able to learn new programming languages and frameworks; - have solid understanding of algorithms and data structures; - have solid understanding of cloud environments (at least as an informed user); - be detail-oriented and thorough. Additional desirable skills (optional): - experience with cloud infrastructures; such as AWS; Azure; or BlueMix; - experience running containers; such as Docker and container managers; such as Kubernetes.,
31896,Software Fault Detection,Trace-based program analysis techniques; such as dynamic slicing and trace differencing; can ease debugging by computing an accurate subset of program statements that are relevant to a particular faulty behaviour. In our prior work; we developed automated dynamic slicing tools and trace differencing tools. While these tools are efficient and effective; they are not integrated into modern development environments (IDE); such as IntelliJ and are rather launched from the command line. This hinders their adoption in practice as developers rather need the support to be integrated into their workflow effectively; to help them debug their code “natively” and consistently with their existing working practices. The goal of this project is thus to integrate the program analysis tools developed in our prior work into the IntelliJ debugger and evaluate the effectiveness of the produced solution.,JuliaRubin,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The student is expected to: - have solid programming experience and good command of Java; JavaScript; Python; or a similar language; - be able to learn new programming languages and frameworks; - have solid understanding of algorithms and data structures; - have good understanding of Git (at least as an informed user); - have experience with existing debugging environments; - be detail-oriented and thorough.

31897,Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy of Biomaterials,Apatite; A5(XO4)3Z; is an important class of phosphate minerals due to its unique ability to accept varied ion substitutions at the A; X and Z positions. Materials researchers have used the A and X positions to produce apatite with applications that include ionic conduction and long-term nuclear waste storage. Earth scientists have utilized Z substitutions for petrology indicators within igneous and metamorphic rocks; including lunar research.1 Z-site substitutions (Z = OH; F or Cl) of hydroxyapatite (HA; Ca5(PO4)3OHX) is essential for calcification within living hard tissues including human dentin and bone; and hypermineralization within crustaceans.2 While OH- to F- substitution (Z-site) along the C-column of the crystal is known to increase strength and acid erosion resistance within apatite materials; the exact location(s); phases (e.g.; CaF2) and medium-range environment (e.g.; CO3-F vs PO4-F) has remained elusive. Diffraction techniques have been unsuccessful due to the lack of long-range periodicity and similar electron density of the F and OH anions. However; solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can probe locally at the F and OH sites; extracting and characterizing the short- and medium-range order caused by Z-site substitutions. 19F and 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy will be essential to study F/OH positions within synthetic and natural apatite. Careful selection will allow us to develop a chemical shift fingerprint tools that can impact and assist researchers in these fields. Multi-resonance techniques will address medium-range structure including X site defects (e.g.; CO3).,VladimirMichaelis,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Research Experience or Course work in: Chemistry; Physics; Earth Science or Chemical/materials Engineering Synthesis Knowledge: Some previous inorganic and / or porous material synthesis experience Characterization experience: Some experience / knowledge of solid-state characterization methods such as Solid-state NMR; XRD; ICP; SEM.

31898,Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy Investigation of Energy Materials,The unprecedented rise in the efficiency of organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells has captured the attention of the scientific community; with rapid advancement in efficiency over the past five years. The ease in which perovskite based solar cells can be manufactured at low temperatures and using a solution-based approach makes them extremely attractive when compared to convention solar cells. The most effective perovskite is the methyl ammonium (MA) lead iodide (MAPbI3) which has been shown to deliver an efficient ~20% conversion; unfortunately the stability of such a species in the natural environment is of concern for the conventional lifetime solar cells are in use (i.e.; 20 to 30 Years). This is due to its propensity to breakdown under routine conditions including the high temperature phase change which occurs at (>60 oC;) and its hydroscopic nature; namely absorbing water eventually forming PbI2; a highly water solution lead salt. This has lead to great concerns regarding the leaching of Pb based salts into the environment; leading to severe socioeconomic issues if not contained. MASnI3 is far less toxic; although more reactive and less efficient at transfer. Efficiency should be tunable over time to improve this aspect; although the reactivity remains to be tackled.,VladimirMichaelis,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Students should have some type of physical science or engineering background. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is used extensively within our research group; therefore some background in physical chemistry; physics or chemical engineering is often preferred; although not necessary.

31899,Spatial AI & Learning Analytics: Extended Reality with ION,Athabasca University has partnered with ELIXR (elixrsim.com) to offer access to XR content and XR ION technologies (ionreality.com) to students. Athabasca University also has research clusters that explore Generative AI technologies. This project will engage Mitacs interns to design extended reality spaces and explore pathways to transform them into Spatial AI spaces. Students will undergo training on extended reality content and technology. Further; they will also undergo an introduction to Generative AI technologies (e.g.; GPT-4 and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)). Equipped with this background; students will be tasked to design interactive Spatial AI environments for experiential human learning. For instance; students could design an environment to train drone pilots or one that simulates a hydrogen fuel cell or one that offers emergency operating procedure training.,VivekanandanKumar,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Having some background in AR and/or VR app development is a significant advantage. Students who are absolutely new to this area is also welcome to apply. The intern will receive stepwise instructions to build AR/VR competencies and will have the opportunity to test them in AR/VR equipment. Further; students will also gain an appreciation for Generative AI techniques.,
31900,Blockchains for Data Storage and Mining in Learning Analytics,The central technology being explored as a platform for this learning trace process is the blockchain algorithm; popularized in cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain algorithms use a hash algorithm; nonce and block code; along with the message packet; to generate a hash code. These can be arranged into a chain by embedding the hash of a previous block into the packet of the next. The nonce key is chosen such that the generated hash is signed; with a static header. Cryptocurrency blockchains use the hash header “0000” as its signature. Unsigned hashes can be fixed by changing all following messages in the chain. Therefore; to ensure tampering security; multiple trace stores will have to be installed for error detection and correction. By following this procedure; tampering in the chain can be detected by the fact that any tampered block in the chain will have an unsigned hash; or by the fact that a particular blockchain does not agree with its comparable chains stored in other servers. This will make the learning trace immutable. In addition to this feature; this project will explore the ability for a student to extend and retract read permissions to this blockchain; or segments thereof; through the use of RSA encryption algorithms. This will make the learning trace under the control of the owner. Additional features of this format to be explored include the ability of evaluating institutions to independently and verifiably add assessments to a learning trace chain; the use of chain attributes as indicators for learning performance; and the use of learning trace chains as a resource for employers evaluating potential and current employees. Architectural features of this project will involve a learning event chain server and data store; a learning event ingestion system; a learning event inferencing system; and a learning event chain browser.,VivekanandanKumar,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,The candidates should have strong coding skills; preferably in Java or Python.,

The Mobius environment enables students to solve problem and also collects their problem solving experience as data. This data on math problem activities can be analyzed to detect cognitive issues faced by students and to offer custom feedback.,VivekanandanKumar,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,The candidates should have some background in mathematics. Exposure to Mobius (digitaled.com/mobius) prior to their arrival in Canada will be an advantage.,
31902,Higher Education and the Fourth Industrial Revolution,With the ability of AI algorithms to learn information; knowledge and insights exclusively from raw data without specific instructions about information; knowledge and insights is evidence that the inflection point has been reached as cognification evolves. The ability to mimic human intelligence; vision; hearing; physical movements; managing resources; diagnosis; nursing; emotion and social interactions impacts every possible domain; except for domains where data does not matter. Students; across these domains; will learn and use such AI algorithms as core skills. As computers mimic and; when needed; exceed human capabilities; jobs traditionally held by humans will be lost; from programmer to truck driver to lawyer to financial analyst to non-specialist physicians to soldiers to factory workers to non-specialist teachers. During these near-inflection years; students will be forced to learn new cognification skills that supplement traditional domain-specific job skills. Near-inflection will also bring in ‘gig jobs’ that are transient in nature and can only be stop-gap. During the later post-inflection years; students will exclusively study cognification skills. Post-inflection years will see massive retraining to help students attain systems thinking; entrepreneurship; cultural agility and critical thinking. AI algorithms and associated technologies will force students to addressing global issues such as poverty; human existence; environmental engineering; genetic editing; hunger; disease; compassion; resource sharing; weather engineer and global planning. Topics such as computing; physics; mathematics will mesh into courses that target global issues because of the changes in career models necessitated by the disappearance of traditional jobs associated with traditional career models. students will no longer code for a computer application; they simply design solutions for the problem; select appropriate pieces of preexisting code; mash them together; inject cognification algorithms; point to the variety of data that already exist and data that can be supplied in the future; and move on to the next application.,VivekanandanKumar,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Students will be asked to explore a range of contemporary skills that higher education students graduate with; across multiple domains; and analyse whether a) these skills will be impacted by cognification; and b) if so; how to up-skill students to complement their skills to aling with cognification. Mitacs interns should be prepared to read; synthesize and write about the fourth industrial revolution and its impact on higher education.,

31904,Biochar and Bees,The berry industry is critically important to Atlantic Canada; producing 28% of Canada's Fruit and Berry production; well above Ontario's 15%. However; the region's berry growers face significant challenges due to climate change. Wild pollinators; which are essential for crop production; are moving away from crops to seek refuge from climate extremes; and poor growing conditions in many areas exacerbate the situation. To address these challenges; we propose utilizing crab biochar; a carbon zero product made from the waste of the crab industry; to enhance the cropping conditions of berry crops; promote nesting of wild pollinators; and initiate natural pollination. The Provincial government has mandated that waste from the crab industry no longer be discarded in compost or landfill; requiring this industry to come up with solutions for utilizing this important waste stream. Louisbourg Seafoods Inc. catches nearly 125;000 pounds of snow crab yearly; with approximately 70% of each crab harvested being disposed of in landfills. This waste represents a significant loss of a natural calcium source that can be charred and used for fruit production. MacQuarrie's group has demonstrated that converting this waste into crab biochar generates a material with the properties of biochar and contains natural lime (CaCO3); which is important not only for plant growth but also for ground-nesting wild bees' preferred nesting conditions. Pindar's group has shown that over half of wild bee species that pollinate berry crops are nesting in the ground. By providing pollinators with a soil amendment that increases their nesting sites within the crop; we can directly increase pollination of the crop. Our proposal aims to leverage the benefits of crab biochar to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly berry production in Atlantic Canada.,StephanieMacquarrie,Nova Scotia,Cape Breton University,English,2024-06-03,The students should have an aptitude for safe work practices and the ability to multi-task in a busy work environment; and be able to work productively as part of a team while responding to feedback.

It would be excellent but not required if the student was enrolled in a post-secondary science program,
31905,Mental illness in the workplace: A meta-analysis,The world is experiencing a mental health crisis. Mental health problems include a general decline in psychological well-being and an increase in mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Mental illnesses are a particular concern in the workplace because they are highly common (i.e.; one in every four employees report experiencing mental health issues); burdensome (i.e.; mental health-related disability claims make up most of the workers' compensation claims); and lengthy (i.e.; 100 days of disability leave in general). Among different types of mental illnesses; depression; anxiety disorders; and substance abuse constitute the most significant portion of mental disorders in the workforce. In this study; we will conduct a meta-analytical investigation (i.e.; analyze and synthesize published and non-published studies) on mental illness in the workplace. We will identify the work-related causes of these three types of mental illnesses as well as their work-related outcomes. Although there is great interest among researchers as well as practitioners on the topic of mental health in the workplace; so far; no systematic efforts have been made to combine the findings of past research to develop a unified model on the topic. Conducting this study will allow us to clarify inconsistent findings; draw a complete picture of past work; and identify future research areas on the topic.,DuyguGulseren,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,- An ideal student for this project is a senior psychology student who took research methods courses. - Attention to detail and the ability to work independently with hands-off supervision are essential. - Being comfortable with remote work. - York University has a commuter campus.

31907,Cell-type specific immunity in plants cells,It is well established that plants can mount a strong defense response against some pathogens. However; very little is known about which cells of a given tissue are responsible to launch this immune response. We have created a collection of genetic resources in which immunity can be triggered in 17 different cell types to study cell-type specific immunity.,HugoGermain,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-13,Rigorous; to like molecular biology; cell biology; microscopy,
31908,Hyper-operations,Hyperoperators are an infinite sequence of recursively defined operations that logically extend the following sequence of elementary arithmetic operations: addition; multiplication (an iterated addition); exponentiation (an iterated multiplication). Historically; one of the first discussions about hyperoperators was the work of Albert Bennet in 1914. But it was not until 1947 and the detailed work of Reuben Goodstein that the modern terminology and notation was established. With the development of computer science; there has been a renewed interest in hyperoperations; which have a number of applications. Pioneers in computer science; theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics such as Donald Knuth and Wilhelm Ackermann were particularly interested in this field. The objective of this research project will be to study the various possible generalizations of hyperoperations (e.g. by extending the domain of definition; by interpolation; by varying the initial condition; ...). In a first step; an exhaustive literature review will be performed. In a second step; a report on the current state of the question will be written. Finally; various theoretical and computational works will be conducted.,FredericMorneau-Guerin,Québec,Université TÉLUQ,Either English or French,2024-05-01,To complete this project; a basic undergraduate background in pure mathematics will suffice.

31910,Gas flow through porous media: landfill, natural gas and sparging wells,The students will review existing analytical; semi-analytical and/or full numerical solutions to gas flow through porous media. There has been recent progress in two directions: flow subject to azimuthally varying permeability in the porous matrix; and turbulence in the vicinity of the ingress into the well. Both were shown to explain some of the control issues experienced in the field. The region close to the well was identified as almost a separate flow field with abrupt changes in pressure and velocity of the gas.

31911,River flow subject to dam operation with realistic riverbed data,Fish living in rivers; where dams have been built; experience water recessions when the dam discharge is limited or stopped. Proper modelling of the flow is essential for estimates of the areas most affected by the dam operation and subsequent impact on fish population. I am interested in constructing and solving water flow equations with the topography of a real river and realistic dam discharge scenarios. This is a part of a larger modelling effort addressing the dynamics of the river; fish spawning grounds; survival of eggs and young; and adult population numbers. The geographic area of interest is the vicinity of the confluence of two rivers; Columbia and Kootenay; in Southern British Columbia. Both have dams located slightly upstream of the confluence; functioning independently. Golder Associates Ltd. are an international consulting company with local offices and profound knowledge on Columbia and Kootenay Rivers' spawning grounds. This project will use their data and understanding of the system in order to devise a viable algorithm that will determine the expected recession given the discharge scenario. This is a good training opportunity for students; who envision their ultimate position in inter-disciplinary scientific research. The intern will gain valuable skills in working in the Unix environment; parallel computing and visualisation of multi-scale solutions. Adequate progress in this project might serve as a step toward continued research and a Master's or PhD degree. The expected outcomes are (a) viable numerical scheme for flow near the confluence (b) optimisation of computation time and memory (c) testing of parameter ranges and calibration against available field data (d) simulation that determines how the impact of flow reduction in one river can be minimised by adjustments in the second dam.,YanaNec,British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-01,Skills / background: (a) fluid dynamics: equations of viscous flow and heat transfer (b) advanced concepts in numerical analysis: finite element/volume formulations (c) C language; MATLAB/Octave an advantage Background: engineering (mechanical/aeronautical/environmental or similar); physics; mathematics or combination of these disciplines.,
31912,Decoupling motion and deformation in ultasound measurements in carotid artery,This project is in collaboration with Prof. Mark Rakobowchuk from the Department of Biological Sciences at Thompson Rivers University. Prof. Rakobowchuk's lab collects ultrasound recordings of the motion of the carotid artery during regular breathing. The tissue of the artery wall is elastic and undergoes stresses that; on one hand; are synchorinised with the heart cycle; and on the other; are coordinated with the pulsatile blood flow and pressure change in the vessel. The contraction force of the heart and the pulsatility of the arterial flow induces longitudinal motion as well as deformation; whilst the periodicity of the blood pressure change causes radial distention and contraction; perforce coupled to the longitudinal deformation. The CAROLAB software processes the ultrasound imagery and is capable of tracking a predefined region of the artery wall. The challenge of this project is to decompose the tracking data into correct components of the stress tensor and velocity vector. This is a good training opportunity for students; who envision their ultimate position in inter-disciplinary scientific research. The intern will gain valuable skills in working with biological signals; image processing; visco-elastic theory; reconstruction of conservation laws in continuum mechanics based on real measurements and uncertainty analysis. Adequate progress in this project might serve as a step toward continued research and a Master's or PhD degree. The expected outcomes are (a) tracking data acquired from ultrasound imagery (b) reconstruction of discrete sampled signals using Fourier transform (c) calculations checking conservation of momentum in the tissue as a continuum (d) identification of decoupled movement and deformation components (e) calculation of stresses experienced by the wall separately due to heart forces and blood flow.,YanaNec,British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-01,Skills / background: (a) fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics: equations of conservation of momentum in viscous flows and elastic media (b) concepts in signal analysis: Fourier transform; smoothing techniques (c) MATLAB/Octave an advantage Background: engineering (mechanical/aeronautical); physics; mathematics or combination of these disciplines.,
31914,Using Software Analytics to Predict Software Quality,Software systems play an important role in our daily lives; making the quality of software systems of paramount importance. To ensure the quality of software systems; my research aim to develop analytics that can be used to predict where software defects may appear in order to remove them before the software is released. The project involves the proposal of models that use actionable metrics to detect risky software changes. In particular; we plan to use data mining techniques to extract historical software development data; stored in software repositories. Using extracted data; we will build metrics and analytics will be used to build statistical- and machine learning-based models that predict risky software changes. To validate the models; we will employ a number of quantitative (e.g.; precision and recall) and qualitative (e.g.; grounded theory) methods. The project will be performed on a number of large and recent open source software systems such as Google Chrome and Android. The project will play an important role and contribute to an on-going project; commt.guru. The successful completion of this project will enable software researchers and practitioners to better understand the key development factors that impact risky software changes.

31915,Using AI to Improve Chatbots,Software systems play an important role in our daily lives; making the quality of software systems of paramount importance. To ensure the quality of software systems; my research aims to develop analytics and tools that can be used to identify potentially defective code and improve the maintenance and evolution of the software. One such tool is askgit.io; a virtual assistant (chatbot) that helps developers navigate and understand their project repository’s data. The project involves the proposal of a virtual assistant (aka chatbot) to help practitioners in various software development tasks. In particular; we plan to use cutting-edge AI and NLP techniques to answer questions related to the software projects. Moreover; the assistant will analyze different software artifacts and activities to highlight possible issues that might occur and suggest solutions to overcome those issues. The assistant should be able to reason the proposed solutions in natural language.

Moreover; the assistant helps to decrease the time-to-market by increasing the development velocity and highlighting critical issues ahead of time so their risk can be mitigated before the software is released.,EmadShihab,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,The student should have the following background: - Knowledge of computer science; software engineering or any related field. - Experience programming in an object-oriented or scripting language. - Knowledge of software development tools (e.g.; Github; Jira) is an asset. - Knowledge of statistics; deep learning; machine learning and natural language processing is an asset. - Good communication and technical writing skills.,
31916,Analysis of Case–Control Studies Data with Errors,The epidemiological studies; diagnostic tests; and comparative therapeutic trials often results in count data presented in r × c contingency tables or cross tables. These must be interpreted relative risk; odds ratio; length of the confidence interval correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two quantities; for example; exposure expressed at three levels none; low and; high and disease expressed as yes or no. For example; the British Medical Journal published a case control study in which the association between tea consumption and esophageal carcinoma was examined. Of the 300 patients with esophageal carcinoma (“cases”); 249 reported that they never; or very rarely; drank green tea; 17 (6.4%) frequently drank green tea. Of the 571 study participants without esophageal carcinoma (“controls”); 356 reported that they rarely drank green tea; in comparison with 30 subjects with regular consumption. However; the effects of inaccurate sample size and or measuring error on the relative risk; odds ratio; length of the confidence interval and the p-value may have serious implications in making informed decisions. The main objective of the proposed project is to study the relative risk; odds ratio; confidence interval and test of hypothesis in case- control studies when data is imprecise and may have sampling or non-sampling errors. The intern will develop neutrosophic statistics methods which are suitable for ambiguous; vague; imprecise; incomplete; or even unknown data values.,PraneshKumar,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Knowledge of Basic Statistics; Calculus; and any Computer software/programming.,
31917,Nanofiber formation by centrifugal spinning,The demand to address the world’s energy and environmental issues creates a pressing need to develop technology and devices; based on high-performance materials; for clean energy (e.g.; energy conversion; storage and conservation); and clean environment (e.g.; water and air pollution abatement). Particularly interesting and useful types of high-performance materials are advanced functional nanosized materials that can enhance charge transport; as building blocks in energy and electronic devices. In this context; nanofibers are being increasingly studied thanks to their unique characteristics such as high surface-area- to-volume ratio; improved thermal and mechanical properties; electrical properties; and confinement effects. Our research on nanofiber production by a new method called centrifugal spinning delivers the fundamental; concrete knowledge to produce nanofibers more easily and at lower cost. Nanofiber production through the Centrifugal Spinning Method (CSM); in which a nozzle or orifice rotates at high speed around its axis of symmetry; can produce high volumes of polymeric fibers with average diameters around 300 nm. To apply CSM; a polymer solution or melt is loaded into a specially designed spinneret capable of rotating the fluid. As a result of the centrifugal force applied; the fluid is forced through the orifices of the spinneret producing continuous polymer jets. The trajectory of the polymer jet is curved due to the rotational forces as they are stretched into nanofibers; which are collected as a fine web on the collectors positioned away from the center of rotation. We propose to study CSM nanofiber formation through a frame- work of integrated theoretical and experimental program; our aim is to provide understanding of the physical mechanisms of the nanofiber formation; characterize the regimes of production; and predict/model nanofiber final radius and its morphology.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,
31918,Fluid flows of non-Newtonian fluids in narrow channels,Viscous fingering (VF) instability occurs when a less-viscous fluid displaces a more-viscous one; and refers to the appearance of finger-like interfacial patterns. Complex densely branched and dendritic-like patterns may be eventually formed as a consequence of a repetitive finger-tip-splitting. There has been a continuing interest in studying VF as an archetype of interfacial pattern forming and front propagation systems since it appears in Enhanced Oil Recovery and Carbon Sequestration. VF may occur in various geometries; while the occurrence of this phenomenon in the Hele-Shaw cells; made of two flat plates; has received much attention as a convenient framework to analyze interfacial instabilities in narrow confined passages; e.g.; in porous media. Most of the Hele-Shaw cell displacement research has revolved around immiscible displacements; focusing on the prediction of morphological features and periodic structures; while extensions to miscible displacements have been limited even for Newtonian fluids. Knowing about this gap in the literature; our research focusing on miscible displacement of non-Newtonian fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell. Literature of the research on viscous fingering in non-Newtonian fluid is very limited. Our novel research will effectively fill this gap for miscible displacements and provide guidelines for oil and gas industry processes that deal with the fingering phenomena.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,Engg-Chemical; Engg-Civil; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Enviromental; Engg-Fuel; Engg-Geological; Engg-Manufacturing; Engg-Materials; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Metallurgical; Engg-Petroleum; Engg-Mining; Engg-Mineral; Engineering; Physics
31919,Multiphase flows of complex fluids,The subject of this project is studying displacement flows of viscoplastic fluids in geometry that is in motion. Viscoplastic fluids are non-Newtonian fluids. The main feature of a viscoplastic fluid is that the fluid does not really deform until a critical shear stress is exceeded locally. Therefore; these gelled or soft-solid materials are seen to be hard-to-remove especially when they are in restricted geometry with a lot of boundaries. However; there are many industrial processes where we do need to deal with the removal of viscoplastic materials. One of the main of these applications is in the petroleum industry; e.g.; in the primary cementing process (PCP) in which viscoplastic drilling mud must be completely removed by cement to provide zonal isolation. Certain geometrical movements (e.g.; pipe reciprocation) are being used to enhance this process; without proper justification or guidance from laboratory research. The proposed research involves studying particular geometrical motions that facilitate the removal of viscoplastic fluids by another fluid; which is highly relevant to PCP; and has high impact in the field of energy and environment. The goal in this new research direction is to employ certain slow movements of flow geometry to remove a viscoplastic fluid by another fluid. The research conducted by the student will deliver how this removal may become possible. In particular; she will investigate the effects of two movements of the geometry on the fluid flow during the displacement flow process: • Slow reciprocation of a pipe geometry along the direction of the flow. • Slow oscillation of a pipe geometry around its longitudinal axis.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,Physics; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Civil; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Petroleum; Engineering; Engg-Materials; Engg-Geological; Engg-Metallurgical; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Enviromental; Engg-Fuel; Engg-Industrial; Engg-Manufacturing; Engg-Mineral; Engg-Mining
31920,Interactions of cell signaling pathways in spinal cord patterning,Zebrafish; a small tropical fish; has emerged as a powerful experimental system to study human development and diseases. Approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. We use zebrafish as a model system; because molecular and genetic analyses can be combined with high resolution in vivo imaging and large-scale small molecule screens. The developing spinal cord is a highly structured organ that consists of different subtypes of proliferative neural progenitors and their post-mitotic progeny. Our previous work demonstrates that the Notch signaling pathway functions to control Hedgehog responsiveness of neural progenitor cells in the spinal cord. In this project; the student will test whether Notch signaling also controls the competence of neural progenitor cells to respond to other cell signaling molecules; such as BMP and Wnt. The student will utilize gain-of-function and loss-of-function tools; including small molecule inhibitors and transgenic lines; to determine if manipulation of Notch signaling affects BMP and Wnt signaling responses in the patterning of the dorsal spinal cord. Using transgenic reporters; the student will visualize the cell signaling dynamics during spinal cord patterning in live embryos. This project will provide novel insights on cell signaling cross-talk and cell fate specification; two important issues in the field of developmental biology.,PengHuang,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a strong background in molecular biology and genetics; and have a strong interest in developmental biology.

31921,Regulation of muscle regeneration in zebrafish,Zebrafish; a small tropical fish; has emerged as a powerful experimental system to study human development and diseases. Approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. We use zebrafish as a model system; because molecular and genetic analyses can be combined with high resolution in vivo imaging and large-scale small molecule screens. Using zebrafish muscle regeneration as a model; my lab studies how crosstalk between muscles and non-muscle cells maintains muscle homeostasis. Through an expression screen; we recently found that ctgfa and ctgfb (connective tissue growth factor); well-known direct target genes of the Hippo signaling pathway; are robustly induced at the site of muscle injury; suggesting that activation of Hippo signaling regulates muscle regeneration. Hippo signaling was first identified for its function in organ size control; but its role in regulating tissue regeneration is largely unclear. In this summer project; the student will determine how Hippo signaling contributes to muscle injury repair. First; using a needle injury assay; he/she will perform in situ RNA hybridization to examine the expression pattern of core effectors of the Hippo pathway; such as yap; taz; and tead; in a detailed time-course during muscle injury repair. As a complementary approach; he/she will carry out immunohistochemistry to determine the subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ as readouts for pathway activation. Next; the student will carry out double staining to determine the identity of cells that show up-regulated ctgf expression during muscle regeneration. Finally; using a transgenic line ctgf:GFP that we previously developed; he/she will perform time-lapse imaging to determine the dynamics of ctgf+ cells during the process of muscle regeneration. This project will help elucidate the role of Hippo signaling in muscle injury repair and provide the foundation for understanding complex cell-cell interactions during tissue regeneration.,PengHuang,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a strong background in molecular biology and genetics; and have a strong interest in developmental biology.

The project will be performed using the Advanced Laser Light Source (ALLS; http://lmn.emt.inrs.ca/EN/ALLS.htm); a state-of-the-art high-intensity femtosecond laser facility; located near Montreal; Canada. The project aims to advance research on a new phenomenon discovered by our group; which increases enormously the intensity of high-order harmonics while simultaneously allowing wavelength tunability. The objective is to clarify the physics of this phenomenon and to apply it to produce high-intensity harmonics and attosecond (1/1000 femtosecond) pulses.

31925,Advanced Terahertz Spectroscopy,Terahertz (THz) radiation science is expected to have an extremely significant impact on a wide variety of disciplines that are bound to shape the lives of people in the 21st century. In particular; THz waves (or T-Rays); with frequency ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz; (i) can penetrate and image inside plastics; semiconductor wafers; fabrics; and most dielectric materials that may be opaque to visible light; (ii) have low photon energies that do not cause harmful photoionization in biological tissue; and (iii) exhibit strong dispersion as well as absorption for numerous molecules. Therefore; T-ray imaging and diagnostics have tremendous potential for applications in non-destructive testing and imaging; medical diagnosis; health monitoring; and chemical and biological identification. However; applications in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum are only now reaching maturity. The full potential of the spectral region is held back by the limited control that we have over the way this form of light interacts with materials. In this project; we will explore a new technique to use THz radiation to detect and monitor the concentration of various targets. Examples of such targets include algal toxins; which could contaminate drinking water; and viruses; such as those that cause pandemics. The viruses (bacteriophages) that we will use in this project are absolutely safe for humans. The project will be performed in our Advanced THz Technology Lab.,TsuneyukiOzaki,Québec,Université INRS,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Strong scientific curiosity and motivation for research are the absolute requirements of the candidate.

31926,Supporting the Health of Victims of Gender-based Violence through Community Programs: Applying an Ethical Lens,Sexual violence is rampant worldwide and particularly pervasive in India; where it has reached and all time high rate during the last decade. The social construction of gender in India remains associated with sustained systematic discrimination against women. Present in spheres of everyday life; it is an issue when seeking health care and justice. One of the consequences is that victims of sexual violence are confronted to inadequate response from health care services and medico-legal systems in regards to quality of response. Quality of health care response creates a safe environment and allows gathering of medical and legal evidence needed for a valid case for medico-legal response and justice. A closer and systematic look at a series of crucial points is needed: 1. the psychosocial support provided to victims; the practices and services surrounding healthcare provision in the context of rape and sexual violence; 2. the process of collection of forensic evidence and practice associated with the clinical exam post event; the reliability of applying protocols and guidelines when and if available; 3. the sensitivity by health care providers to social determinants of health and contextual experiences affecting the ‘victims’. These factors highlight the current situation in India where forensic evidence collection is the main focus to the detriment of care and psychosocial support of victims of sexual violence. Actions are required to take into consideration the victims’ voices in the forensic evidence collection process and establish empathetic medical and legal services for better provision of care and justice. While guidelines and standard protocols for interventions post rape do exist; and standard protocols for the collection of forensic evidence are being improved; what is needed is a better understanding of the premises for an increased quality response within an integrated health system and medico-legal practices sensitive to living contexts.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

31927,The Changing Landscape of Women’s Health: Challenges and Opportunities of Global Health: At the Intersections of Gender and Migration,The first week of the 58th Commission on the Status of Women ended in March 2014. Information ranging from the most effective strategies to economically empower women to learning more about the initiative; which focuses on the voices of men by encouraging them to speak out against the discrimination and inequalities experienced by women and girls globally. Empowerment beyond numbers: this is one of the messages that we need to continue and work on as we think of the challenges that women are still facing beyond geographical frontiers. Significant work has been accomplished and provided a substantive conceptualization of female-male relations; both inside and outside of the public domain; challenging the social determinants and risks contributing to poverty; and designing routes of women’s empowerment with concrete health achievements. By applying a gender lens with sensitivity to the socio-political context of poverty alleviation strategies; research and interventions in public health increasingly provide a positive outlook characterized by an empowerment approach. Recognizing the intricate and complex nature of development processes which lead to the undeniable conclusion that women must become actively engaged as socio-political actors in the fight against poverty; one of the objectives of this internship is to contribute to discussions on the knowledge base which requires an accounting of the conditions and circumstances of women’s lives; both at home and in their communities. The activities will draw upon the fact that social determinants are central to programs and policies regarding prevention and control of diseases such as HIV/AIDS; malaria and tuberculosis. While there is ample literature demonstrating that social factors promote and/or undermine the health of women; men; families and populations; there is limited knowledge about the social processes underlying the unequal distribution of health among specific populations which in turn; is at the root of persistent social disparities.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

31928,Understanding Challenges associated with Female Genital Mutilation/Excision: Addressing Sex, Gender, Ethnicity and Migration,Migrant-receiving countries namely Belgium; Canada; France; Spain; Sweden and Switzerland are involved in this project. It focuses on improved care and prevention for migrants from female genital circumcision or mutilation (FGC/M) performing countries. Provision of optimal; equitable and gender-sensitive health care to women and girls with FGC/M; and to those who may be at risk of being exposed to this practice is challenging; as dissatisfaction and unsease experienced both by women and health care providers regarding the quality of care available has been increasingly reported. It is proposed to gather knowledge; attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals towards FGC/M; to identify the extent to wich current healthcare provider training packages incorporate the voices of women who have been subject to FGC/M; to compare and contrast predictive models of risk estimates across the partner countries; to gain better understanding of the best practices regarding policy implementations and legal frameworks with regards to the prevention of FGC/M. Quality of health care response creates a safe environment and allows gathering of medical and legal evidence needed for a valid case for medico-legal response and justice.

31929,End-of-Life and Palliative Care: Cultural and Gender Diversity as Determinants of Access and Equity,Abstract: Drawing on feminist ethics and an intersectional analysis; the objective of the project is to discuss how relational autonomy is related to equity and human rights. We argue the need to uphold ethical commitments in clinical health care encounters that are personalized; informed by human relationships; recognition of social specificities; sensitive to context and human interdependencies. Given the increasing exposure of health care professionals to moral issues related to equity and rights in the context of gender sensitivity and cultural diversity; there is a greater need to mitigate intersecting structural vulnerabilities related to both micro (individual) and macro (health policy and practice) level that shape health outcomes differentially for women; men; boys and girls. In our analysis; we intend to examine how relational autonomy and intersectionality can advance the virtues of principle of respect for autonomy by addressing intersecting vulnerabilities that can occur when language; gender; health literacy and other categories of social difference; impact informed consent in health and research contexts. Overall; the project focuses on the complexity of relational alternatives that promote equity and rights of those involved in clinical relationships.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

31931,Improving Health Equity: The Promising Role of Community Health Workers in Canada: Unravelling Gender based Challenges,While there is ample literature demonstrating that social factors promote and/or undermine the health of women; men; families and populations; there is limited knowledge about the social processes underlying the unequal distribution of health among specific populations which in turn; is at the root of persistent social disparities. Social determinants draw attention to a number of social factors such as women and men’s social and economic circumstances; which contribute directly to their health The objectives of this internship are anchored in the knowledge that one of the most powerful ways to advance development and health is to increase the most vulnerable section of the population; largely women; to adequate health care services; which in turn allows for improvement of quality of their life and that of their families. While epidemiological evidence indicates that in low or middle-income countries; selected infectious diseases such as Hepatitis A and E are more prevalent among men than women; this may be explained by gender differences in the social pattern of interactions. In addition to differences in exposure and risk of infection; there is a difference between men and women in the progression from infection to disease; in turn leading to a differential in the notification rates and treatment among women and men.

31936,Automated Intelligence-driven malware detection, identification and characterization,We believe that by monitoring system processes; memory and CPU usage; log analysis; API or systems calls; and network traffic; then correlating it with malware behavior patterns we can identify a wide range of threats to an organization beyond using current vulnerability scanning methods. Over this program we will focus on advancing research in intelligent; driven malware detection by identifying and developing a bank of malware; pattern recognition models; detection techniques; and tools for understanding the real behavior of malware on a system and developing a comprehensive and proactive solution to detect and remove them. The goal of the proposed research is to design and develop an intelligent; pattern recognition system that uses the evasion tactics against the malicious apps on smart-phones to detect the zero-day attacks. The effective intelligence system can only be generated when all information about the different malware families has been collected; analyzed; correlated; and leveraged to define a unique family pattern for malware specifically on smart-phones. So; the following objectives have been identified for this proposal; each objective will become the focus of a work package as outlined in the forthcoming explanation. All proposed objectives are strongly interlinked as they will share a common goal; and build a comprehensive re-trainable model for monitoring and detecting malware. The objectives are as follows: Bank of malware (Malware dataset); Malware anatomy analysis; Big Data Analysis by Deep Learning; and Automated detection system and Pattern Visualization.,ArashHabibi Lashkari,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,Students should have: - Good Programming skills in Java or Python - Strong Data Structures and Algorithms skills - Creativity - Enough knowledge and background in Machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) - Able to work with a group of 5-7 international students,Computer Science
31937,Intelligence-Driven Dark Web Detection and Characterization System,Nowadays adversaries are working on multi-layer encryption strategies in dark-web. For example; instead of using just Tor; they are using VPN and Tor together which make it more complicated and difficult to monitor and detect. So; classifying traffic flows according to the applications that generate them like VoIP; Audio Streaming; P2P; File-Transfer and Video Streaming is an important task for monitoring the trends of the applications in multilayer network communications. However; an accurate method that can reliably identify the generating application of flow is still to be developed. In this R&D project; we address the problem of multi-layer traffic classification as the main common techniques in dark web environment and the ultimate objective is to offer a tool using AI to network operators that will provide a meaningful detection and classification per application; and if this is infeasible; with useful insight into the multi-layer traffic behavior.,ArashHabibi Lashkari,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,Students should have: - Good programming skills in Java or Python - Strong computer networking and network security skills - Creativity - Enough knowledge and background in Machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) - Able to work with a group of 2-3 international students,Computer Science
31938,Intelligence-driven Cyber Attribution System,To determine the actor or actors responsible for a cyberattack; experts often conduct extensive forensic investigations; including analyzing digital forensic evidence and historical data; establishing intent or motives; and taking into account the overarching situation. Meanwhile; push for stronger online defenses comes as their doctrine to the growing role of cyber operations in modern warfare. Cyber attribution; based on analysis of network forensics; host forensics; and malware analysis is one of the best techniques to identify the actor of a cyber activity. By long-term collection of cyber activities with known actors and targets; it is natural to create a dataset for these massive data and use AI approaches to predict the attacking team.

31940,Supporting Canadian Apprentices in the Construction and Industrial Sectors: Genetic and Epigenetic Analyses of Mental Health,We are proposing a novel gender-inclusive approach with a focus on understanding barriers faced by women; youth; and other underrepresented groups to increase recruitment; improve retention; expand and stabilize the construction and industrial workforces across Canada; and support employers. This study aims to parse the contributions of genetic and epigenetic variations in individuals at workplace to increase our understanding of the genesis of burnout and other occupational stressors as well as behavioral compatibility with jobs in the trade and additional traits such as tenacity. We will perform whole-genome analysis of genetic markers of the participants (apprentices) at the study entry. Furthermore; analysis of genome-wide methylation (epigenetics mechanisms) status and stress level of employers and apprentices at the study entry (Arm A - cross-sectional) and analysis of genome-wide methylation changes and stress levels in the employers and employees over one years (Arm B - longitudinal) will be performed. Arm A will be the preliminary step and Arm B will further investigate the temporal relationship among stress exposure and epigenetic changes. We hypothesize that different genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in burnout and other occupational stressors. The sample will consist of 100 participants (employers and apprentices in the Construction and Industrial Sectors). The participants will be recruited by the Ontario Electrical League (OEL). The burnout score will be measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be extracted from white blood cells. The genome-wide methylation levels will be measured using bisulfite conversion and the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit (Illumina Inc.; San Diego; US). Furthermore; whole-genome genotyping will be performed using the Illumina Omni 2.5-8 array at the Centre for Applied Genomics in Toronto (TCAG).,BehdinNowrouzi-Kia,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,-Strong data collection and analysis skills -Descriptive and inferential statistics A candidate with background in health professions and/or biological science or related with an understanding of the fundamentals of molecular genetics is highly desired,
31941,Creating a functional profile of spasticity in the upper limb post stroke: Rehabilitation interventions following upper motor neuron syndrome,Spasticity is a common consequence of stroke; with a prevalence of 38% within the first year. One of the main features of spasticity is increased excitability of the stretch reflex (Lance; 1980); but it has also been characterized as altered sensorimotor control; featuring involuntary activation of muscles (Childers et al.; 2004). Occupational therapists play an important role in the treatment of spastic upper limb hemiparesis (Albany; 1997; Hoare & Imms; 2004). These treatments including splinting; casting; stretching; functional electrical stimulation; neuro developmental therapy; modified constraint-induced movement therapy; repetitive task training; strengthening exercises; and pain and swelling management (Dromerick; Edwards; & Hahn; 2000; Eftekhar; 2017; Gracies; 2001; Horgan et al.; 2017; Paci; 2003). Upper limb spasticity can interfere with function and cause pain and contractures. Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNTA) has been effectively used to reduce spasticity; however; the impact of BoNTA combined with rehabilitation on upper limb function is not clear. The study will have two phases. In phase 2; the learner will analyze data from a series of questionnaires that collected medical records of persons receiving BoNTA to reduce spasticity in upper and lower limbs. The information collected includes demographic (e.g.; age; gender; marital status; affected side; type of stroke; time since stroke ( first or second stroke; diagnosis; employment status and clinical characteristics (e.g.; time since stroke in years; affected side of body; type of stroke; targeted muscle groups; type of treatment receives; frequency of treatment; Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment hand or arm score; type of botulinum toxin; dosage (units). In phase II; learners will collect the abovementioned information using the questionnaire. Individuals with joint deformities and contractures; cognitive impairments; or an inability to follow instructions will be excluded from the study.,BehdinNowrouzi-Kia,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,-Strong data collection and analysis skills -Descriptive and inferential statistics,Health Studies; Occupational Health; Public Health; Rehabilitation Medicine; Psychology; Statistics; Educ-Psychology; Physiology; Chiropractic; Ergonomics; Medical Sciences
31942,Examining work disability and function in systematic lupus erythematosus,The project entitled Work disability and function in systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE): a national mixed-methods sequential explanatory study uses a multidisciplinary patient-centred collaborative practice to offer a practical solution that permits the delivery of complex care that can also be individualized. SLE is a multisystemic disease in which the body’s immune system attacks its organs resulting in disability and mortality; requiring a multidisciplinary approach for its management. Studies report that multidisciplinary teamwork in healthcare is associated with improved patient engagement and participation in their care processes in work rehabilitation3. Moreover; our national team and the participation of different centres across Canada is essential to provide insight into the breadth and depth of work disability and function in SLE and to enhance the external validity (generalizability) of this project findings. The multidisciplinary approach is aimed at improving patient care and avoiding miscommunication between various patients as much as possible1. Using a multidisciplinary team approach has shown successful outcomes in the management of chronic kidney disease; diabetes; and rheumatoid arthritis. The examination of work disability and function in SLE necessitates the recognition of the complexity; multidimensionality; temporal dimensions of SLE and its relationship to work and warrants a multidisciplinary perspective. Nevertheless; there is a dearth of evidence regarding the use of a multidisciplinary team approach in improving work disability and functional outcomes in patients with SLE. This project proposes a collaborative team approach to create a functional profile of work disability. Furthermore; it will benefit from a stellar multidisciplinary research team that includes expertise in epidemiology; patient education; medicine; knowledge mobilization; quantitative; and qualitative methods. The research team members have clinical backgrounds in nursing; occupational therapy; psychology; psychiatry; rheumatology and social work.,BehdinNowrouzi-Kia,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Interest and academic background in occupational public health; descriptive and inferential statistics.

31943,Characterization of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in plant oil biosynthesis,Triacylglycerols (TAGs; also known as vegetable oils) are the major form of carbon and energy storage in most oleaginous plants and have been widely used as food; feed; and sustainable feedstock for fuel and green chemical production. In plants; the terminal steps of TAG biosynthesis are catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT). These enzymes are important in determining the flux of carbon into TAG and thus have been the targets of numerous studies to bioengineer oil production. Recently; we found DGAT and PDAT may interact with some lipid enzymes and form spatially distinct interactomes for efficient substrate channeling to TAG. This project will further identify protein interactors of DGAT/PDAT; characterize the nature of the possible interactomes and investigate whether/how they affect lipid biosynthesis; with the long-term goal of improving our understanding of oil biosynthesis and eventually developing tailor-made photosynthetic organisms for oil production targeting food; biofuel and green chemicals.,YangXu,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-06,Students with molecular biology and/or biochemistry background are preferred.,Biochemistry; Molecular Biology
31944,A phenomenological study of the lived experiences of intimate partner violence among disabled women in Newfoundland,The aim of this research project is to explore the lived experiences of intimate partner violence among self-identified disabled women in Newfoundland. In this study; disability is defined as any long-term physical; intellectual; or sensory impairment that may hinder individuals’ full participation in society. This research is inspired by the findings of a qualitative meta-synthesis that revealed a significant gap in the empirical literature related to the experiences of intimate partner violence among disabled women in Atlantic Canada. This qualitative study is informed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA); a methodological approach for exploring how participants make sense of their world and their experiences. A service user advisory group will provide consultation on various aspects of the research project; including the conceptual and design phases of the study. Following an ethics review and approval; approximately twenty disabled women in Newfoundland who are survivors of intimate partner violence will be recruited for an in-depth; semi-structured interview. Interviews will be conducted in person and virtually. Participants will be asked to share experiences related to their understanding and experience of intimate partner violence; the impact on themselves and their children (if applicable); their coping strategies; decision-making related to seeking help; and life after the relationship. The interviews will be transcribed and coded thematically using data analysis and management software guided by the analysis principles of IPA. The study findings will be disseminated in academic spaces; local community organizations; and service user groups. One manuscript will be authored and submitted to an academic journal for consideration. In addition; a knowledge synthesis report and infographic will be designed and shared with local community organizations and service user groups. A presentation of best practices for service providers will be presented at the local women’s centre.,AmiGoulden,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-01,The ideal student for this research project will be interested in the intersection of intimate partner violence and disability.

31945,Smart Self-Cleaning Antimicrobial Coatings,I propose to create a new class of hybrid antimicrobial materials that will effectively repulse or kill and repel a variety of pathogenic bacteria; viruses; and fungi. Moreover; the chromogenic nature of these coatings will enable simple visual colorimetric assessment of the level of the contamination; relative cleanness of the surface and indicate the need for the replacement and cleaning the material. We will use a molecularly defined approach to create surfaces based on covalently attached multifunctional organometallic monolayers on conductive supports that decrease initial adhesion; growth; and proliferation of cells. Moreover; simple and energy-efficient electrochemical stripping will allow additional cleaning of the surfaces.,OlenaZenkina,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-07-08,Preferably student with chemistry and/ or microbiology and/or materials science/ electrochemistry background with high interest to work on interdisciplinary project.,Chemistry
31946,Coordination based assemblies for electrochromic (EC), electro-optic, and photonic materials. (1),Coordination based SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) will be prepared and examined as robust functional EC materials and in molecular electronics. We will prepare a series of nitrogenous ligand -Fe2+ type materials covalently anchored on an appropriate support (TiO2; WO2; FTO/on glass; or silicon). Subsequently; we will fine-tune the colour of our assemblies by rational ligand modification.Varying the number of pyridine moieties and changing the nature of the organic functionalities in one or several pyridine rings; (introducing a conjugated organic moiety or fused aromatic ring); or metal moiety will significantly affect metal to ligand (M-L) charge transfer and as a result change the colour of the metal complex. Through this approach; we will access different colours (red to blue). From preliminary results with terpyridine-Fe2+ SAM covalently immobilized on FTO/glass; electrochemical switching the oxidation state from Fe2+ to Fe3+ results in complete decolouration of the material. We will explore chemical and electrochemical switching properties; stability; conductivity and colour efficiency of these novel materials. The ultimate goal will be to create applicable EC materials with high coloration efficiency; colour homogeneity; high contrast ratios and controllable switching time. Changes in molecular design and deposition procedures (SA in solution and vacuum deposition) will be used to explore different arrangements on the surface. Structural factors such as length and bulkiness of the organic spacer; sterics and electronics; and the nature of the metal moiety; will be varied in order to investigate their influence on the packing density and properties of the SAMs. Finally; molecular wire-like highly conductive materials on activated silicon surface could be achieved using vinyl-terminated molecules.,OlenaZenkina,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-07-08,Preferably upper year chemistry student with chemical background (Organic and Inorganic; Materials; Analytical or Instrumental chemistry) and good synthetic skills.

31947,Preparation of functional materials on the surface for detection of metal ions (1),In this project; visiting exchange student will work closely with other lab members; on the synthesis of novel ligands and their deposition on surfaces. We will determine binding affinities and establish stoichiometry of the coordination of the ligand to a variety of metal ions. Self-assembled monolayers formed from these novel ligands will be further interacted with aqueous solutions of suitable metalloproteins. The exchange students who advance this research will learn organic; inorganic; analytical; physical; and surface chemistry; will get strong experience in applying their knowledge to design new materials starting from synthesis of molecular building blocks; assembly them using various binding motifs; and analyze the optical response of the developed sensor interacting with a variety of analytes. Metal binding affinities; surface coverage; porosity; stability; electrocatalytic; redox; electrochromic and spectroscopic properties will be optimized. Chemical modification of the ligand will allow for the incorporation of metals of different sizes that will define the hydration shell and as a result; the properties of the SAM. Various functional motifs could be introduced into one multidentate ligand to simultaneously detect different metals and allow real-time simultaneous detection and quantification of various analytes in multicomponent systems. Once the binding and detection of single metal ions are well understood on support; we will then prepare sensing arrays able to analyze multicomponent systems. Mixed molecular assemblies with a homogeneous distribution of key functionalities will be prepared by 1) co-deposition; when few functionalities competitively absorbed on the same solid support; or 2) stepwise deposition where large templating molecule are pre-deposited on support and then smaller molecules fill available space on the surface. Controlled ‘molecular printing” on the solid support with an appropriate mask or direct-write bottom-up deposition will be used to create sensing arrays with pre-designed patterns and properties.,OlenaZenkina,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-07-08,Preferably chemistry student with some background in chemistry (Organic and Inorganic; Analytical or Instrumental chemistry).,
31948,Evolution and speciation in birds,Past MITACS students have worked on a variety of projects and I try to involve the student when deciding on the specific project to make it more meaningful. Most of the projects use molecular markers to look at population genetics either of a single species or closely related species/subspecies. We examine how landscapes and behaviour influence dispersal and can ultimately lead to speciation. Most of the projects are on land birds; however; some are on seabirds. Some of the project will involve field work; a great way to see the animals in their natural setting and to see a bit of the country. Some of the projects also involve genome sequencing.,TheresaBurg,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,Ideally students have some lab experience and a background in Biology; but it is not required. They must be able to work independently (after training); manage their time; follow instructions; and work in a safe manner. You will be working as part of a team. Genetics is more important than ever in almost every field of Biology; these projects give students a great starting point to learn the genetics as well as get hands on experience developing and working on a project. The projects also allow students to combine field and lab work in a single project.,Biological Sciences; Ecology; Biology; Environmental Studies; Genetics; Zoology
31949,How has domestication affected the brain?,The process of domestication has dramatically changed the behaviour and anatomy of many animal species that are used by humans for production purposes; lab animals or pets. Of the many widespread changes that occur in domesticated animals relative to their wild counterparts; one that has largely escaped detailed investigation is changes to the brain. Domesticated animals typically have relatively smaller brains and brain regions compared with their wild ancestors and it has long been suggested that this is due primarily to a decrease in neuron numbers. However; recent studies in my lab suggest that the anatomical changes in the brains of domesticated animals are due to more complex changes. The successful applicant will build upon this work through the neuroanatomical analysis of domesticated species and their wild counterparts. Currently; we are working primarily on variation among pigeon breeds selected for unique behavioural or anatomical traits. The results of these studies will be important for understanding how human selection for traits can affect the brain and has implications for interpreting results from lab animals; the long-term success of captive breeding programs and the effects of domesticated animals interbreeding with wild animals. All of our students learn a variety of skills in microscopy and histology; including the use of specialized slide scanners and software for quantifying cell numbers; sizes; and structure.,AndrewIwaniuk,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-13,The successful applicant should be undertaking a degree in biology; psychology; veterinary medicine; medicine or zoology and have some basic wet lab skills; such as using pipettes and electronic balances. Experience in dissections or histology is desirable; but not necessary.,
31950,Sensory abilities of birds,Determining the sensory abilities of different animal species is crucial to understanding how they navigate their environments; find food and even interact with humans. Behavioural testing can; however; be costly; time consuming and difficult for many species. An alternative approach is to examine the anatomy of the sensory pathways in the brain responsible for detecting and discriminating among environmental stimuli. Using this approach; my lab has made several major discoveries in how birds perceive their environment. For example; turkey vultures have enormous olfactory systems that enable them to find dead animals before other scavengers arrive and hummingbirds have enlarged very specific visual nuclei in the brain that process how the direction and speed at which they move. These discoveries rely on sophisticated microscopy equipment in our lab as well as access to our extensive brain collection. Currently our focus is on the visual and auditory systems of falcons and hawks. Working with wildlife rehabilitators; we have a variety of falcon and hawk species in our anatomical collection. The primary question we want to address is how vision and hearing abilities vary among falcon and hawk species in relation to behaviour by examining their anatomy in detail. This project is ideal for students interested in learning about brain anatomy and the skills are transferable to medicine; veterinary medicine; biomedical sciences and scientific research.,AndrewIwaniuk,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-13,The successful applicant should be undertaking a degree in biology; psychology or medicine and have some basic wet lab skills; such as using pipettes and electronic balances.

31952,History of Science in Science Education: exploring new frontiers through the study of elementary students' identities,Addressing Nature of Science (NOS) and History of Science (HOS) in science education has been recognized as beneficial for developing students' decision-making abilities and their comprehension of scientific processes. However; recent research noted that going beyond knowledge acquisition and considering the power dynamics and subjectivities at play is essential. This project seeks to bridge this gap by applying an identity lens to NOS research. By exploring the intersection of students' identities and NOS/HOS approaches in a grade 8 science class; this research aims to deepen our understanding of how historical approaches can shape students' perspectives on science. The ultimate goal is; clinging to the socio-political turn in science education; to enhance science education by empowering students to critically engage with science; recognize their own subjectivities; and participate in social transformation. The primary objective of this study is to explore how a historical approach in a grade 8 science class can mobilize students' identities when addressing NOS-related discussions and to develop a pilot research tool to characterize the relationship between students' identities and NOS themes. The second objective includes a comprehensive evaluation of how this project could be done in the future in BC schools. Main data will be collected in Brazilian schools; through interviews; observations; class material and recordings; which will be analyzed using qualitative research techniques. As for the second objective; steps will include: mapping the new BC science curriculum in its potential connections to the HOS/NOS; analysis of the structure of schools in Burnaby district; analysis of teacher education programs in BC with regard to its engagement with and common teacher materials in BC schools in regard to the inclusion of History of Science.,CristianoBarbosa de Moura,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-07-01,Candidates for this position should: - Have completed at least 2/5 of the course credits of a science teacher education program by the time of the internship; - Have an interest in the History of Science and/or have completed an informal or formal course in the History of Science; - Be proactive; curious; and independent and has to have an interest in pursuing research in science education. - Have a good command of English and Portuguese languages.,Educ-Science

The goal of the project is to monitor small molecules like; chemotherapeutics; antibiotics; drug of abuse or neurotransmitters using aptamer-based biosensors. This sensing platform uses a surface-attached aptamer (a DNA sequence specific for a molecular target) receptor modified with a redox reporter; which; following target recognition can undergo a binding-induced change in electrochemical signal measured using a potentiostat. To test the usefulness of the sensors; sensors are miniaturized and immersed directly in the relevant matrix (i.e.; saliva; urine; blood; cerebral spinal fluid; etc.).,PhilippeDauphin Ducharme,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Good laboratory practice are required from the student.

31954,Understanding biotrophic plant pathogens,Clubroot is a devastating disease infecting roots of plants of the Brassicaceae family and responsible for 10–15% yield reduction on a global scale. The clubroot pathogen; Plasmodiophora brassicae; is an obligate intracellular biotroph that belongs to the class Phytomyxea. The life cycle of P. brassicae starts in the soil; where resting spores; which can remain viable for up to 20 years; germinate in response to the presence of plant hosts and initiate primary infection. During secondary infection; susceptible plants develop galls that disrupt water and nutrient uptake; leading to wilting; stunting; and; in some instances; death of the infected plant. The mechanisms by which the clubroot pathogen can escape plant immunity in the susceptible host and induce the root galls characteristics of the disease is still unknown. Based on what we know about biotrophic pathogens from other evolutionary groups; effector proteins might play a key role in mediating P. brassicae pathogenicity. Prediction of effectors based on conserved motifs has been very challenging for this pathogen; mainly because of unique features inherent to P. brassicae; including its inability to grow in axenic cultures. This scarcity of information about P. brassicae effectors stresses the need to find other ways to assess more effector candidates to better understand the etiology of the clubroot pathogen. That is precisely one of the projects being developed in our lab; the characterization of P. brassicae effector candidates to study their function during the infection. For that we use biochemistry; molecular biology and microbiology methodologies. We will also generate Arabidopsis plants expressing the effectors in order to investigate if these proteins can affect plant immunity and response to pathogens.,EdelPerez Lopez,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The main skill required from the student is curiosity; critical thinking and love for science. Of course; students with a biochemistry; bioinformatics; molecular biology; microbiology and biotechnology are going to have better chances to enjoy more the projects and to be able to have interesting results that can be published in a peer-review journal. This internship can be the door for a master; a PhD; an academic career.,
31956,Transparent and flexible "plastic" solar cells for portable applications,Solar cells commercialized to date can be divided in two categories: i) high-cost high-efficiency devices from crystalline inorganic materials and ii) low-cost low-efficiency ones from cheap; disordered materials. Increasing the market for solar energy by developing lightwight and portable devices at high-efficency and low-cost is vital to enhance competitiveness with respect of non-renewable energy sources. Organic mixtures of fullerenes (spheroidal molecules entirely formed by carbon atoms) and electrically semiconducting polymers (a discovery awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize for Chemistry) are extremely promising as low-cost materials for flexible "plastic" solar-cells. When mixed together; conducting polymers and fullerenes are intense light absorbers; with record efficencies over 10% in solar-cell prototypes. Additionally; they are low-density; soft; and easily bendable; which is essential to fabricate flexible; lightweight and portable photovoltaics on inexpensive plastic substrates. In order to further increase their performance; it is essential for us to understand how particles carrying opposite electrical charges; which are generated in extraordinary amounts by illuminating these materials; can be even more efficiently dissociated at the interface between organic semiconducting polymers and fullerenes; and therefore transformed into electrical currents. The process is known as profoundly different from its counterpart in "standard" inorganic and cystalline solar-cell materials; such as; for example; p-type and n-type silicon--the most popular commercial solar-cell material to date; which; however; is neither cheap; nor lightweight; nor flexible. In this project; the student(s) will fabricate organic photovoltaics with active layers of polymer-fullerene and characterize them; both with standard techniques (a solar simulator and a photoconversion efficency estimator) and unique superresolution tools (scanning near-field optical microscopy available in Fanchini's lab) where polymer aggregates and fullerene clusters of few hundred nm's can be independently illuminated and probed. The objective is to shed light on the photodissociation mechanisms at the nanoscale; and optimize them towards more efficient organic photovoltaics.,GiovanniFanchini,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,The student(s) expected for this project will have a solid background in Physics; and/or Electrical Engineering and/or Engineering Physics or Materials Science and/or Chemistry. The student will also possess lab experience (for example in physics; chemistry and/or engineering courses with laboratory components) and some computer programming skills in any language for technical programming. Courses in Materials Science; Electrical Circuits and/or Optics are desirable. Additional courses in Quantum mechanics; Solid State Physics; Solid State Chemistry and/or Condensed Matter Physics are a "plus" but are not essential.,
31958,Computational platform for materials screening and engineering,The utilisation of computer modelling in exploration of novel materials is much less common. The material modelling is often limited to interpretation of experimental observations; rather than facilitating the discovery of materials with properties tailored to specific applications. The success of a computer-aided material design approach relies on the ability of a model to relate the atomic structure of novel compounds to their properties and eventually to device characteristics from first principles. This project will contribute to the advancement of quantum mechanical approaches for the simulation and invention of novel functional materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications (including solar cells; light emitting diodes; and lasers); energy materials (batteries; supercapacitors); quantum materials. The goal is to develop and test accuracy of a high-throughput computational platform that takes an atomic structure of a material as an input and predicts its relevant functional properties as the output in an automated manner. For instance; this can be a charge potential for the battery; of a band gap and effective mass for a transparent conductive oxide. This development will improve cost effectiveness of the materials design by reducing the number of trial and error experimental realisations thereby accelerating technological advances through analysis and simulation of novel materials; which allows the assessment of their potential at an early stage.,OlegRubel,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-13,Knowledge of electronic materials; solid-state physics; computer modelling and programming; Lunix operating system,
31959,Interviewing Children,This research project will focus on children's memory and honesty during forensic-based interviews. This project will involve a large-scale project to explore children's memory of events as well as their understanding of adult-child interactions. Working with a science summer camp; a research confederate will stage an event and; the following day; children will be interviewed about that event using common police-interviewing protocols. In particular; children will be assessed for: (1) their understanding of what is a typical adult-child interaction; (2) how well they remember the event details; and; (3) children's ability to remember the confederate they saw (eyewitness memory). This project will involve working with 300+ children between the ages of 6 and 12 years-old.,KailaBruer,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-20,Students will be conducting interviews with children and; as such; will need strong interpersonal and language (i.e.; English) skills. Students will need to be training in basic psychology research methods; statistical analyses; and theories of child development. Students should have experience in; or be interested in learning about; forensic and applied research with children. This will require a student who is highly adaptable with strong problem-solving skills. The ability to work in Open Sesame; Python; and R is an asset. Knowledge of Canadian/US legal systems is an asset.,Computer Science; Development Studies; Psychology; Law
31960,The role of the R2TP complex in protein homeostasis (1),RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 helicases are two related and highly conserved members of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA+) superfamily. They were recently identified independently by multiple groups and have been shown to be essential for viability and development of several model organisms including S. cerevisiae; D. melanogaster; and X. laevis. They are coexpressed and are thought to mainly function together in a large number of cellular processes. The importance of these helicases is that they have been found to be critical components of several key multiprotein complexes including the chromatin remodeling complexes INO80 and SWR-C; the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex; and the telomerase complex. RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 were also found to be involved in snoRNA maturation and pre-rRNA processing. Significantly; the helicases have recently been implicated in carcinogenesis. The transcription of genes of both proteins were found to be dysregulated in several cancers such as liver; bladder; and melanoma. Importantly; it has been shown that decreased expression of RUVBL1 or RUVBL2 results in reduced tumor cell growth and increased apoptosis in vitro. These observations strongly indicate that RUVBL1/RUVBL2 could be therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Nevertheless; the biological activity and the molecular mechanism of their function remains poorly understood. Based on a large-scale proteomics effort; WAH’s group identified two highly conserved novel Hsp90 interactors that were named RPAP3 and PIH1D1; which bind to the chaperone and which also associate physically and functionally with the RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 helicases to form a highly conserved complex; which we termed the R2TP complex. We demonstrated that Hsp90 and the R2TP complex function to promote the proper biogenesis of several key protein complexes. Hence; we are interested in determining the structure and mechanism of funtion of the R2TP complex.,WalidHoury,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have working knowledge of protein purification and protein biophysical characterization.,
31961,Role of the ATP-dependent Protein Degradation System ClpXP in Mitochondrial Protein Homeostasis (1),The mitochondrion generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress and result in damage to many mitochondrial proteins. Chaperones and proteases in the mitochondrion combat this damage. One of the main proteases in the mitochondrial matrix is the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease. Both ClpX and ClpP are nuclear encoded proteins that are translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. ClpXP is well-studied in many bacterial species; but very little is known of its functions in mammalian cells. However; mitochondrial ClpXP has been found to play an important role in activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response; UPRmt. ClpXP upregulation has been implicated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and ClpXP has been suggested to play a role in Parkinson's disease. Hence; we are interested in using biochemical and biophysical approaches to determine the activity and selectivity of human ClpXP. We are also interested in determining the physiological function of human ClpXP in the cell.,WalidHoury,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have working knowledge of protein purification and protein biophysical characterization.,
31962,The Development of Novel Antibiotics_Clone (1),In recent years; there has been an alarming trend of increased bacterial infections caused by strains resistant to most known drugs. As a result; diseases that were thought to be controlled by currently available antibiotics are re-emerging not only in developing countries but also in industrialized nations; especially in clinical settings such as hospitals. Therefore; there is an urgent need for the development of new types of antibiotics that can be used to effectively treat multidrug resistant bacteria. In this project; we propose to screen and develop a novel class of antibacterial drugs that can activate highly-conserved; tightly-regulated; self-compartmentalizing cylindrical proteases in bacterial cells. One such protease is ClpP. On its own; ClpP can only degrade small peptides and not folded proteins. The binding of unfoldase chaperones to ClpP is required for the degradation of native proteins. ClpP has recently been validated as a novel molecular target for antibacterial drug development. We aim to develop and identify novel compounds that allow ClpP and other such cylindrical proteases to indiscriminately degrade folded proteins eventually causing bacterial cell death. The efficacy of the compounds will be tested using model infectious bacterial systems. These compounds will define a new class of antibiotics; namely activators of self-compartmentalizing proteases; which we will refer to as ACPs. Students will work on characterizing the biochemical consequences of the binding of ACPs to the cylindrical proteases using purified proteins and pertinent biophysical methods. Students will not be involved in working with any pathogenic bacteria.,WalidHoury,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have working knowledge of protein purification and protein biophysical characterization.,Biochemistry; ; Biological Sciences; ; Biology; Chemistry
31963,Modeling for increasing rate of genetic gain in pulse crops,Common bean is an important pulse crop worldwide and it is a staple for human populations across the developing world. We use computational tools to simulate the outcomes of plant breeding programs and determine the most likely scenarios that deliver on the goals of plant breeders. We hypothesize that there is room for improvement in increasing the historical rate of genetic gain in pulse crops; such as common bean. Therefore; the objective of this project is to create a framework for the simulation of every detail of multiple types of breeding programs and determine the rate of genetic gain as a result of each one across time. We are also interested in testing the if genotype x environment interactions play a role in the maximization of genetic gain and broad adaptation of individuals developed using different breeding program schemes.,ValerioHoyos-Villegas,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,The student will require some understanding of genetics and preferably plant breeding. This project is primarily computational and the ideal student will have some skills or the desire to improve their computer programming skills; particularly in R.,Agriculture; Computer Science; Genetics; Statistics
31964,Development of new training population sampling methods using machine learning tools,One of the main ways to make processes in plant breeding more efficient is the use of genomewide selection (GS). GS uses markers across the genome to determine the genetic merit of an individual within a large breeding population. GS depends heavily on the accuracy between two groups. One group is the training population; characterized by genotypic information (DNA markers) and phenotypic information (from the field). The second group is the inference population; comprised of only DNA marker information. Constructing a sufficiently accurate and robust training population is difficult; and as generations advance this accuracy potentially breaks down. We want to explore the use of statistical modeling and potentially machine learning tools to construct training populations that result in high accuracy with minimal breakdown. The hypothesis here is that a "guided" (either with model validation tools or machine learning) construction of a training population can be much more reliable than the current standard which is random sampling. For this purpose; we have DNA markers available and phenotypic information from common bean and chickpea cultivars. Our interest is to develop code and potentially a tool that is available to the wider plant breeding community and further improved using collaborative coding tools.,ValerioHoyos-Villegas,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,This project will require a student that is capable of coding in R or python and can use UNIX/Bash to conduct modeling and population simulation in a high-performance computing environment. It is also important that the student understands statistics and some methods of sampling and model validation. A student with some understanding and experience in machine learning methods would be highly desirable but not essential.,
31965,Improvement of standard methods for enhancing pulse grain quality,Pulses are among the most important foods for human nutrition worldwide. They comprise the primary staple for over 2 billion people in the developing world and are highly relevant for the diets of over 100 million people in the developed world. The project will involve studying novel phenotyping methods for the assessment of quality traits in pulses. We are interested in developing a low cost method for the standardization of protein in dry bean and pea samples. The objective of this work is to calibrate an NIR model for the determination of protein in dry bean and protein and and oil in dry pea. The project may also extend into standardization of the method into canned samples of dry beans and peas. Depending on the progress; the project will also extend into genetic variation as the measurements will be undertaken on a Mesoamerican diversity panel of dry beans of approximately 300 lines which are already genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms. For genetic analysis; a genome-wide association study will be incorporated into the internship. The intern will learn skills in field plant breeding; experimental design; coding and statistical and genetic analysis.,ValerioHoyos-Villegas,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,Basic genetics Basic statistics Basic computer skills; basic coding skills useful but not required.

31967,Systems biology approaches to study interbacterial interactions,Projects in the lab use high-throughput approaches; including systems biology and functional genomics; to study the metabolism and physiology of bacteria in contexts that are relevant during infections. Our goal is to define novel potential targets that could help the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. In particular; we are interested in understanding interbacterial interactions; for instance between bacterial pathogens and bacteria from the microbiota. We use single-gene deletion collections to define genes that are essentials during these interactions. We believe that theses genes represent possible targets and will be useful to design novel antimicrobial strategies. Our model organisms are Escherichia coli; Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During this project; the selected intern will be in charge of confirming and characterizing some genetic interactions from our high-throughput screens. The exact project will be defined in collaboration with the selected intern according to his/her interest and skills.,Jean-PhilippeCôté,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Our lab seeks motivated students with an interest and experience in microbiology; bacterial genetics; bioinformatic; or something similar. Students should be able to work independently and posses good organizational skills and scientific curiosity. Understanding French is an advantage.,
31970,Loneliness, Privacy and Social Robots,This research project will create a dialogue between programmers (beginning with student programmers and ultimately consumer-programmers) with target user groups (e.g. caregivers of seniors; then seniors themselves) to assess levels of trust in social robots that are executing programs designed to help address loneliness through either interaction with the robot alone or as a means to connect the user to other people. Programmers will receive a two-pronged mandate: 1) Design a program for a social robot that will adapt to and engage with a user seeking companionship and/or connection to their community (or for whom a caregiver has provided the robot for these purposes); 2) Programmers will either be instructed to foreground user privacy; or to ignore it. These programs will be demonstrated to potential users participating in the study; either in person or through an informational video. In the research project; we will assess the reactions and impressions of potential users to these programs; in order to examine the effects of factors such as: pre-formed attitudes toward social robots; personalization features of the program; ability of the program to connect the user to the broader online or offline community; user assessment of the privacy risks of the program; amount and quality of information users perceive about the data collection features of the program; level of understanding of current data protection obligations in Canada; perceived needs potentially met by the program; and demographic differences; including especially cultural differences. This research project will collect data from user participants via a demographic questionnaire combined with individual interviews. The interviews will be analyzed using a mixed method qualitative approach; including inductive analysis techniques; as well as narrative analysis to unpack the way that participants situate themselves in relation to the role the robot might play in their lives.,PatrickHung,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-04-30,The students should have a background in Business; Social Science or Computer Science/Information Technology.,Computer Science; Cultural Studies
31971,Research on the Psychology of Cleanliness,Physical cleansing removes more than physical residues; it produces psychological consequences across numerous domains. For example; washing or wiping hands reduces the influence of prior immoral experience (Zhong & Liljenquist; 2006); dissonance about a prior decision (Lee & Schwarz; 2010); recent good or bad luck (Xu; Zwick; & Schwarz; 2012); pessimism from a failure (Kaspar; 2012); and so on. But what mechanism may account for such diverse effects? The theoretical challenge here is that there is little content overlap among these domains (morality; dissonance; luck; failure). Is it possible to explain them all in a unified account? We propose an integrative mechanism to account for these diverse effects: cleansing activates a mental procedure that temporarily removes psychological residues of any kind from the mind. This mechanism has a range of novel implications; two of which are tested in the present research project. Specifically; cleansing (vs. no cleansing) should make events that occur prior to it more psychologically distant and abstract (Trope & Liberman; 2003; 2010) but events that occur subsequent to it more psychologically close and concrete (Study 1; N = 80). Because construing an event in abstract rather than concrete terms tends to involve fewer affective components; cleansing (vs. no cleansing) should lower the affective intensity of prior events but heighten that of subsequent events (Study 2; N = 160). In short; cleansing may help people down-regulate their emotions associated with the past and up-regulate their experience of the present. To test both hypotheses; we will conduct two experimental studies during the 12-week internship. Participants will be recruited from the university campus to complete the studies. Results will be analyzed and evaluated for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal.,Spike W.

31972,Research on Abstract Thinking and Metaphorical Mind-Body Relations,"Dirty" thoughts; "warm" personality; "heavy" topic; "bright" future. Abstract thinking is often grounded in metaphorically associated bodily experiences with the physical world. But what psychological mechanisms underlie all of these diverse groundings? We propose an integrative framework to account for the causal effects of bodily states on people's judgments and behaviors. The framework assumes that each bodily state activates its metaphorically associated feeling; concept; goal; and procedure. This internship will investigate two predictions made by the framework; focusing on the role of physical cleansing as a bodily procedure of separating information of the past from the present task at hand. Study 1 (N = 80): Creativity. Participants will first read a story that includes words from a Remote Association Task (RAT; Mednick; 1962). Then they will either use or examine a wipe. Next; they will complete 15 RAT sets; each showing three words (e.g.; sore; shoulder; sweat) and asking for a word that logically links them (answer: cold). We predict that using (vs. examining) the wipe will increase the number of RAT sets completed. Study 2 (N = 160): Problem Solving. Participants will be told at the beginning that they have to solve 10 problems; the accuracy and efficiency at which will reflect their cognitive abilities. Right before they begin; they will either use or examine a wipe. In actuality; they will only solve one problem; the Duncker candle problem (Duncker; 1945); where the solution requires creative use of objects beyond their usual functions. We predict that using (vs. examining) the wipe will result in higher likelihood and shorter time of successfully solving the problem.,Spike W.

31973,Research on the Physical Foundations of Moral Foundations,The past 10 years have witnessed a rapidly expanding body of behavioral research that reveals a set of five innate; universal foundations; from which all cultures build their moral intuitions (Haidt & Graham; 2007). But cultures and groups differ in their relative emphases on the different foundations. For example; while both liberals and conservatives emphasize care/harm and fairness/cheating; conservatives give additional emphasis to loyalty/betrayal; authority/subversion; and sanctity/degradation (Graham; Haidt; & Nosek; 2009). Although these moral foundations have been shown to predict economic behaviors and political attitudes; it remains entirely unclear how they are represented in the human mind. Without understanding how the mind processes moral foundations; the theory has difficulty in extending its explanatory scope and predictive accuracy. Our research addresses this critical gap of knowledge. Drawing on insights from grounded cognition (Lee; 2016; Lee & Schwarz; 2014; 2016); we propose that the abstract meaning of each moral foundation (care/harm; fairness/unfairness; loyalty/betrayal; authority/subversion; sanctity/degradation) is represented; processed; and interpreted through a specifically mapped domain of physical experience. In two small-scale pilot studies and one large-scale experiment; we will test the causal influence of five bodily experiences on people’s attitudes towards the five moral foundations and on people’s monetary decisions driven by each foundation. Confirmatory results will provide the first evidence for the physical foundations of moral foundations.,Spike W.

31975,Pathways for the decarbonization of process heat in Alberta,The increasing concerns of climate change and the need to limit the global temperature increase below 1.5oC above the pre-industrial levels requires us to make a significant shift in the way we generate and use energy. Industry processes are among the significant energy users giving rise higher levels of CO2 emissions since most of the industry process heat comes from the burning of fossil fuels. A number of technologies are considered to have the potential for the decarbonization of process heat. These include high temperature heat pumps; geothermal energy; solar thermal among others. However; the applicability of these technologies for different process heat requirements has not been widely studied. Moreover; there are limited studies that have considered the performance of such technologies under realistic operating conditions in Alberta. This project seeks to identify the industry process heat needs and develop concepts for meeting these needs using clean; renewable; and sustainable energy technologies. Among the technologies that will be evaluated include the use of geothermal energy; use of electric resistance heating; use of high temperature heat pumps; concentrating solar thermal and combinations of two or more of these systems. Applying the fundamental engineering laws; the performance of the developed concepts will be evaluated; and their technical and economic feasibility established. Besides; models to determine the long-term performance of these systems will be developed and evaluated.,AggreyMwesigye,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,Completion of the fundamental courses in Thermodynamics; Heat Transfer and Fluid Mechanics is essential.

31976,Additive manufacturing of Ti-5553 alloy via wire arc deposition process,For a considerable time; titanium alloys have been the preferred materials in the aerospace industry due to their outstanding combination of physical and mechanical properties. So far; Ti-6Al-4V; an α+β alloy; has been predominantly used for aerospace applications; specifically in fuselage and engine components. However; there has been a growing interest in near-β Ti-alloys that have a two-phase microstructure comprising the hcp titanium α-phase and the bcc titanium β-phase. This is due to the various thermal and thermo-mechanical processing that can result in a wide range of mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of near-β Ti-alloys are highly influenced by their internal microstructure; which often comprises multiple phases and precipitates. The final mechanical properties can be significantly improved by forming fine and uniformly dispersed α precipitates in the parent β matrix. The presence of the ω phase in near-β Ti-alloys can significantly impact the size and distribution of the α phase. However; a high-volume fraction of the ω phase may cause embrittlement of the alloy due to the limited mobility of dislocations. As a result; a thorough understanding of the phase transformations and microstructural evolution is critical to optimizing the mechanical properties for different applications. The additive manufacturability of Ti-5553 alloy has not been studied extensively. Therefore; several samples were generated by depositing Ti-5553 wires on Ti-5553 plates from single-layer to multi-layer depositions while varying the deposition direction. The student needs to study the microstructures of the cross-sections of the different coupons via optical and electron microscope and determine the local mechanical properties; like hardness. The student also needs to perform some post-process heat treatments to modify the microstructure.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31977,Microstructural and mechanical property relationships in a near beta titanium alloy during various thermal treatments,Titanium alloys have been the material of choice for aerospace industries for a long-time due to their excellent combination of physical and mechanical properties. So far; Ti-6Al-4V; an α+β alloy has dominated the titanium use in aerospace applications; mostly in fuselage and engine components. But recently; near-β Ti-alloys have seen a lot of interest due to the possibility of a two-phase microstructure; consisting of the hcp titanium α-phase and the bcc titanium β-phase. Therefore; a wide range of mechanical properties can be achieved through various thermal and thermo-mechanical processing. The properties of near­β Ti­alloys are highly dependent on their internal microstructure; which often is composed of multiple phases and precipitates. The volume fraction; size; morphology; and distribution of these precipitates can significantly influence the final mechanical properties. Mechanical properties can be significantly improved with the formation of fine; uniformly dispersed α precipitates in the parent β matrix. The presence of the ω phase in near­β Ti­alloys may have significant influence on the size and distribution of α phase. Again; the presence of high volume fraction of ω may cause embrittlement of the alloy due to the limited mobility of dislocations. Therefore; a complete and detailed understanding on phase transformations and microstructural evolution are crucial to optimize the mechanical properties for various applications. Variations in the heat treatment parameters such as time; temperature; and cooling rate may form various volume fractions and morphologies of α-phase within the β-matrix. In this research program; various thermal processing parameters; precipitation kinetics; microstructural evolution through optical and electron microscopes will be addressed extensively. Finally; the effect of all these parameters and microstructural features on the global and local mechanical properties will be investigated.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31978,Fusion weldability of Al2024 alloy with the presence of TiC nanoparticles in the weld pool.,Aluminum Al2024 is widely used in the aircraft and automotive industries due to its excellent mechanical properties that are further improved by precipitation hardening through artificial aging. However; the presence of significant amounts of alloying elements makes this alloy vulnerable to solidification cracking during casting; fusion welding; and additive manufacturing; which limits its industrial applications. Although much research has been conducted to eliminate solidification cracks during fusion welding; it has mostly been reported to be only partially successful. Recently; the addition of nanoparticles in the melt pool during welding and additive manufacturing has been shown to be effective in completely eliminating solidification cracks in high-strength aluminum alloys such as Al7075. However; this approach has not yet been tested for Al2024 alloy; which is equally important in the aerospace and automotive industries. To address this gap in research; Al2024 sheets and TiC nanoparticles infused filler metal will be used to arc weld in the machine shop for characterization. Various weld parameters will be tested to reduce weld defects such as porosity and underfill. Coupons for metallography and tensile testing will be obtained by cutting the welds using an electrical discharge machining system. Optical and electron microscopes will be used to study the microstructures and defects; and tensile tests will be performed to determine the mechanical properties and soundness of the welds. Micro-indentation hardness testing will also be conducted to determine the local mechanical properties of the welds.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31979,Fusion weldability of Al6061 alloy with the presence of TiC nanoparticles in the weld pool.,Aluminum 6061 (Al6061) is a popular aluminum alloy known for its excellent strength and corrosion resistance; making it a common material choice for a wide range of applications. However; when it comes to fusion welding Al6061; there are specific considerations that need to be kept in mind. This is because high-strength aluminum alloys like Al6061 contain substantial amounts of alloying elements; making them prone to solidification cracking during casting; fusion welding; and additive manufacturing. This limits the use of these alloys in various industrial applications. To overcome this issue; much research has been conducted to eliminate solidification cracks during fusion welding. However; most of the reported methods have been found to only partially remove the cracks. Recently; a new technique has been introduced where nanoparticles are added to the melt pool during welding and additive manufacturing. This method has been reported to be effective in completely eliminating solidification cracks for high-strength aluminum alloys such as Al7075. The same technique has not been tested yet on Al6061; even though it holds significant importance in various industries.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31980,Cartographie de la peur : examen des caractéristiques physiques et sociales d'une ville canadienne de taille moyenne,The project is situated at the intersection of criminology and sociology. The main objective of this research is to analyze the physical and social factors that contribute to feelings of insecurity and fear in a medium-sized Canadian city. The City of Moncton is experiencing significant demographic changes: in the last 10 years; its population has increased by 20%. These changes are affecting the social dynamics of the area. The City of Moncton is experiencing significant demographic changes: in the last 10 years; its population has increased by 20%. These changes are affecting the social dynamics of the area. An increase in property crime rates has been coupled with a sense of insecurity reported by the local media. To conduct this study; we are using data from an online survey conducted in the spring of 2022. Analysis of this data will map areas where nearly 400 respondents reported feeling uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. Data were collected at the individual level; but also at the selected area level. The survey builds a mind map of insecurity and other related issues that is very useful for this project. First; it will examine the social factors that contribute to respondents' feelings of fear: gender; age; ethno-cultural background; socioeconomic status; relationship to these spaces; experiences of victimization; etc. Second; the physical characteristics of places identified as unsafe will be examined: buildings; green spaces; streets and sidewalks to name a few. By understanding how these factors interact with perceptions of insecurity; the project can help develop more effective public policies to enhance safety in the city.

31981,Metabolic and inflammatory outcomes of the ketogenic diet comparing saturated and unsaturated fat sources,Canola has tremendous economic importance to Canada with 20.8 million acres under cultivation in 2020; and a total value of $26 billion. The USA Food and Drug Administration allows canola oil to carry a qualified health claim for reduction of coronary heart disease when substituted for saturated fat. Very low-carbohydrate diets; also called ketogenic diets (KETO) are popular for weight loss and are gaining interest as a treatment for diabetes because they may reduce the requirement for drugs to control blood sugar. However; KETO are often high in saturated fats; which may increase cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors. Substituting heart-healthy canola oil for saturated fats may improve these outcomes. We aim to compare glucose response; cholesterol and inflammation in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes after following KETO for 6 months compared with a third group consuming a standard diet recommended by Diabetes Canada. One KETO group will receive a supply of canola oil (KETO-Can); the other group will receive a supply of saturated fats (KETO-Sat); while the control group will consume a low-fat diet focused on whole grains. We expect that the results will support the hypothesis that outcomes; particularly cholesterol and inflammatory markers; will be improved in the KETO-Can group relative to the KETO-Sat group. The important outcomes including glucose response; triglyceride (TG); total cholesterol (C); LDL-C; apolipoproteinB100 (ApoB100); inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP); (adipo)cytokines and T- and B-cell populations of the immune system will be measured at baseline; 3 and 6 months.

31982,Searching for plant cell surface receptor function,Plants use a large family of cell-surface receptors to sense environmental cues; most of which have no demonstrated biological function. One of the main aims of our lab is to assign function to these orphan receptors; using classical methods in addition to high-throughput screening and network analysis. We currently have a collection of about 200 mutant lines of the experimental plant Arabidopsis; each of which lacks a single member of this large gene family. To identify candidate functions for these receptors we will screen these mutants for abnormal responses to pathogen signals or other stresses. When a mutant shows an altered phenotype or response; we can infer that the missing receptor plays a role in the biological pathway that relates to the applied stress. The receptors that you identify will then be carefully analyzed to determine how the receptor functions as well as identifying the other plant molecules involved in that pathway.,AdamMott,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-06-03,The ideal candidate will have a background in any of the following areas: plant biology; cell and molecular biology; plant immunology; or plant stress biology.

31983,Do prophage aid in colonization of the tick vector by the Lyme disease spirochete?,Borrelia burgdorferi encodes numerous prophages that have long been known to be associated with primary skin and tick isolates. Additionally; we have identified B. burgdorferi phages in the midguts of B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. However; the importance of these prophages in the tick vector has not been explored. Therefore; we seek to determine the function of the B. burgdorferi prophages in the I. scapularis tick vector by defining their influence on the tick microbiome. Previous data has shown that I. scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi have a lower prevalence of Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas when compared to B. burgdorferi-free I. scapularis. We will investigate this observation further in the context of the B. burgdorferi prophages and determine if these prophages are lytic to Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas by in vitro plaque assays of purified B. burgdorferi prophage. We believe that the conservation of B. burgdorferi prophages in Lyme disease Borrelia and the detection of prophages in the midgut implies the necessity of B. burgdorferi prophages during the natural enzootic cycle. Therefore; our hypothesis is that B. burgdorferi prophages allow these spirochetes to establish a niche among the symbiotic microorganisms of the tick vector. We will investigate this hypothesis by determining the lytic properties of prophages on common tick symbionts. Time permitting; we would also like to explore and characterize the prophage genes responsible for bacterial lysis.,JennyWachter,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Knowledge in performing a wide variety of complex procedures and techniques which may include; but are not limited to: microbial cell culture and basic manipulations; proper aseptic technique; phage isolation and purification; phage plaque assays; PCR amplification of gene sequences; design of synthetic genes; gene cloning; bacterial transformations; gel electrophoresis; DNA analysis; DNA isolation; DNA purification; DNA sequencing; DNA gel purification; protein purification and analysis; western blots; PAGE; knowledge in presenting and interpreting data.,

These properties can be further improved by precipitation hardening through artificial aging. However; the presence of multiple alloying elements in these alloys makes them highly prone to solidification cracking during casting; fusion welding; and additive manufacturing; which restricts their widespread industrial applications.

31987,Robust study on Detection, Identification and Characterization of Microplastics in wastewater treatment systems,MPs reach wastewater treatment plants through domestic and industrial wastewater making plants (WWTPs) the potential sink of MPs. Improper treatment of MPs in WWTPs will release MPs again to the environment by releasing them into freshwater streams and through dewatered sludge MPs also end up in landfills. Hence; WWTPs are a significant point sources of MPs for both surface and soil. WWTPs are thus an ideal place to eliminate MPs from being an emerging contaminant. Samples from different stages in WWTPs will be collected and using different sample processing strategies MPs are extracted; isolated; and characterized from these samples. All the studies so far lacked a standard protocol for MPs analysis in wastewater samples. This research mainly focusses on the optimizing pre-techniques for efficient removal of organic matter from wastewater and wastewater sludge matrices to improve the MPs recovery and implementing advanced characterization techniques (FTIR; Raman; SEM; Microscope; DSC-TGA; py-GC/MS) to develop a sensitive; reproducible; and efficient detection and quantification methods for MPs in the WW matrix.

Biological secondary treatment processes are widely used in wastewater treatment plants and rely on microorganisms to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. The project aims to develop a novel bioreactor design depicting suspended/hybrid systems and operational strategies for likely consequences of microplastic weathering in these systems; specifically focusing on biofilm-mediated MPs weathering. This bioreactor system will be used to investigate the impact of weathering on microplastics and the impact of MP weathering on the treatment efficiency of biological treatment processes and to develop operational strategies to optimize the treatment process and mitigate MP pollution the environment. The study will involve the collection of wastewater samples from WWTPs. These samples will be analyzed for microplastics and their characteristics; such as size; shape; and composition. The bioreactor system will then be used to simulate biological secondary treatment processes and investigate the impact of weathering on the removal efficiency of microplastics. The successful candidate will conduct experiments; analyze data; and prepare reports on their findings.

31989,Fighting superbugs: understanding microbial virulence and discovering novel antimicrobial solutions,Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has reached global disaster status; where existing antibiotics fail to treat infections. By 2050; 10 million people a year could die worldwide due to AMR; up from around 700;000 today. Infectious diseases pose a severe problem to health worldwide with a considerable social and economic burden. However; most research addressing this problem relies on testing isolated microbes under conventional lab conditions; which do not adequately represent the infection situation. These discrepancies likely lead to failure to capture the entire arsenal superbugs deploy during infection. The proposed research project addresses these knowledge gaps by uncovering the microbial weapons unleashed only during infection but not in traditional lab conditions; which will enable the discovery of novel therapeutics that disarm microbes from these weapons. The student will explore the microbial virulence phenotypes under conditions that mimic different infection situations. Virulence phenotypes include biofilm formation and response to host innate immune system and may involve testing under various in vivo infection models. The observed microbial responses will be characterized through interdisciplinary studies using microbiology; biochemistry; molecular biology; chemical biology; and advanced chemogenomics methodologies. This work will uncover new clinically-relevant virulence targets for the development of novel antimicrobials. Therefore; the goal is to exploit the newly identified targets to discover drugs that cripple microbes' ability to cause severe infections under clinically-relevant conditions; using state-of-the-art high-throughput screening campaigns; providing new potential treatments for infectious diseases.

31991,Urban stormwater management: blue, green and grey solutions,The proportion of the global population exposed to flood risk is growing. Space is limited in urban centres; and it is challenging to meet the ambitious; but necessary; stormwater management objectives of LID (naturalized water balances; flood control and water quality management) in practice. Experience tells us that decision-makers; designers and other stakeholders are often required to combine the three types of stormwater infrastructure together: Blue (detention systems) are integrated with Green (vegetated systems) and Grey (conventional minor and major stormwater systems) stormwater infrastructure together. However; these stakeholders continue to face a scarcity of technical literature; design guidance and needed regulatory frameworks that addresses how these systems can be integrated.

31995,Chemical modifications of metallo-organic frameworks,Metallo-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recently developed by combining various metal and ligand combinations. Due to their many advantages they have found their way in application such as catalysis; energy; carbon dioxide conversion etc. However; it is still not well understood how MOFs can be chemically modified and if such modifications can be tailored without compromising the integrity of the MOF. In order to design materials for specific applications; the systematic study of MOFs nd their chemical modifications is needed. Hence; this project aims to evaluate how chemical modifications of MOFs affect their structure and properties. The MOFs of interest include those with luminescent metal cores; and pyrene-based ligands. The chemical modifications of MOFs will be carried out in four ways: a) by displacing metal center; b) by displacing ligand; c) by chemically modifying existing ligand; or d) by forming new coordination complexes within MOFs. The modification will change the metal and ligand content in MOF as well as change its morphology and optical properties. The expected outcomes of this project are to 1) determine how MOF modification affects structure and properties; and 2) identify the link between chemical modifications and structure/property/function. This project will allow us to tailor MOFs and control the materials properties. The student involved in this project will carry out MOFs synthesis; MOF chemical post modification; and MOF characterization; as well as study the properties of these materials.

31996,Electrosynthesis towards carbon-carbon bond formation and formation of new value-added chemicals,Electrosynthesis has been recently resurrected and successfully applied to several new chemical transformations. It is a greener alternative to a traditional chemical synthesis. Due to its many advantages; electrosynthesis is ideally suited for bond breaking and making. For example; this method can be used to break chemical bonds towards remediation of pollutants. In addition; this method allows for formation of new bonds; such as C-C bond formation between phenolic compounds. We have published on electrosynthesis and formation of C-C dimers from substituted phenols which are used in industrial applications. Hence; this project aims to evaluate how electrosynthesis may be used for chlorinated phenols; which have industrial implications and end up in the environment. The goal of the project is to use electrochemistry to dechlorinate such chemicals; and make new value-added chemicals. Ultimately; we aim to recycle and reuse chemicals which are already in use. The electrosynthesis will be carried and compared to traditional chemical synthesis. Specifically we aim to: a) compare reactivity of several structurally similar chlorophenols; b) evaluate effects of applied potential; electrolyte and solvent on reaction outcome and yield; and c) monitor reaction by spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The expectation is that chlorinated phenols will be dechlorinated and will form new C-C bonds to create larger dimers. Such new compounds may have enhanced properties such as fluorescence; which is of interest in material science. The expected outcomes of this project are to 1) determine how electrosynthesis compares to traditional chemical synthesis; and 2) identify the link between electrosynthesis parameters and reaction yield/ selectivity. This project will allow us to tailor electrosynthesis towards remediation of pollutants and creation of new chemicals with enhanced fluorescent properties.

31999,Linear Infrastructure Impacted by Geohazards and Climate Change Effects,Climate change effects are shaping how we design; operate; and maintain linear infrastructure; such as roads; rail lines and culverts; and add an additional layer of complexity of how we manage these assets. Some of the key climate change effects include higher temperatures; change in season duration; more frequent and intense storms; and a warmer; rising ocean levels. The frequency; scale and intensity of climate change related hazards (e.g.; wildfires; flooding; geohazards) are expected to increase with more adverse outcomes. Higher temperatures may lead to reduced levels of service (e.g.; road surface rutting; rail line buckling); slope instability associated with the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires; and soil desiccation results in lower water absorption capacity and strength capacity. More intense and frequent storms exceed the existing capacity of water management systems that has resulted in catastrophic failure of embankments. Erratic variations in season duration and temperatures will; in some regions; increase the risk of frost/thaw cycling impairment of the road surface. From the Canadian perspective; due to polar amplification; the Artic regions are warmer at a much greater rate than the global average. Consequently; these northern regions have witnessed accelerated infrastructure deterioration; landscape transformations and disturbed ecosystems due to the adverse impact of climate change effects on permafrost (i.e.; ground that has been permanently frozen for more than one year) thaw. The geographic location (e.g.; urban; rural; coastal; inland) influences the nature and extent of the climate related hazards (e.g.; flooding; subsidence; slope stability) and frames the infrastructure exposure. There is a need to better understand the vulnerability of these assets to climate change effects by assessing both the infrastructure sensitivity (i.e.; degree to which infrastructure may be affected) and adaptive capacity (i.e.; ability to minimize adverse effects).,ShawnKenny,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,The student should be enrolled within a civil engineering program; where interests in climate change and geotechnical engineering are preferred.

32001,Topological Data Analysis,Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is currently a very active field of research; and much of the recent progress comes from studying so-called persistent modules. These are classical objects from topology (homology groups); which change when some of the parameters grow towards infinity. The topological features which "persist" over a longer range are considered important aspects of the data set; and this information can be used gain knowledge; also using techniques from machine learning. These methods have successfully been applied in a number of areas ranging from medicine to cybersecurity. However; the methods to compute and study persistent modules are computationally expensive; and a speed-up would be much needed: the current limit lies at around 1000 data points; which is too little for detailed image analysis. The aim of the research project is therefore to test and develop faster methods to perform these calculations involving persistent modules. For example; much of the current software relies on computing the range of large matrices; but they do not apply known methods from numerical analysis or stochastic methods to estimate this range. The first goal can be formulated in terms of linear algebra: given a sequence of matrices M_1 to M_n whose product is defined; find an efficient way to estimate the rank of the product M_1 ... M_n. More research is then needed to study similar questions for more complicated systems of matrices.,ThomasBrüstle,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-05-06,A good knowledge of linear algebra is required; as well as ability to implement and test new or existing methods on a computer.

Our overarching goal is to address community-driven research questions in order to implement and evaluate evidenced-based interventions and policies to increase community mobility; access; and participation for persons with disabilities. Researchers will work with community and civic partners when developing; implementing; and evaluating these novel interventions and policies. This project will help Canada reach its obligations as a signatory on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To reach these goals; the project team will focus on the following research question: How does the built environment affect the out-of-home mobility and social participation of people living with sensory impairment(s); i.e. a) low vision and blindness; b) deafness and hard of hearing; and c) mild-to-moderate dementia? Through this project a new generation of scholars will have the opportunity to develop specialized research skills related to neighbourhood mobility; participation; disability; and aging. This project also adopts an integrated knowledge translation strategy which involves disseminating findings to both academic and non-academic stakeholders through means including social media networking platforms (LinkedIn; Facebook; Instagram; and Twitter) and academic conference presentations; journals; and posters.,AtiyaMahmood,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-06-03,Students should have basic research methods training in qualitative and/or quantitative methods as they will be participating in data collection in community settings.

32004,Aging in the Right Place Project,"Aging in the right place" involves supporting older adults to live as long as possible in their homes and communities; while recognizing that where an older person lives impacts their ability to age optimally and must match their unique lifestyles and vulnerabilities. "Promising practices" are innovative solutions that have not been subject to rigorous evaluation but hold the promise of supporting "aging in the right place”. Through a community-based participatory research approach; we will be using mixed-methods to evaluate promising practices across an inclusive housing continuum to determine "what works; why it works; and for whom it works." We will capture and evaluate the housing environment; staff of promising practice; support services; experience of older adults; and near-home neighbourhood environments to gauge well-being; aging in place; and housing satisfaction among a diverse group of older adults. Photovoice interviews will be conducted among the older adult participants encouraging the documentation of their perspectives through photography and storytelling. Our overall goal is to improve the shelter/housing options to meet the unique and complex health and social needs of diverse groups of older adults facing housing insecurity. To achieve this goal; our specific objectives are to: 1. Evaluate promising practices across the housing continuum that promotes aging in the right place to ultimately make recommendations for expanding a promising practice locally (scaling up) or enabling a promising practice to be adapted in other communities (scaling out). 2. Train a new generation of scholars to develop advanced research skills and lines of inquiry on housing insecurity; and aging research. 3. Facilitate knowledge mobilization around promising practices in Canada and internationally; while increasing public awareness of housing insecurity and perceptions of aging in the right place through public lectures; media; interviews; publications; and photo exhibits.,AtiyaMahmood,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-06-03,Students should have basic research methods training in qualitative and/or quantitative methods as they will be participating in data collection in community settings.

32010,Speech perception and language acquisition in infancy: Behavioural and neural studies,Language is our most unique; and arguably most important; human capacity. It underlies all human achievements; from the establishment of civilization through current advances in health; education; science; and technology. At the crux of language’s utility is the link between form – in the case of spoken language; speech – and meaning. We at the Infant Studies Centre (Dr. Werker and her trainees) examine this interface as an essential entry into how language development begins in early infancy. We explore how infants’ initial speech perception sensitivities are shaped by experience to become reorganized into functional phonological categories; ultimately driving word learning. Put simply; we study the learning mechanisms and neural processes underlying language acquisition. Pertinent measurements include infants’ looking-time and/or looking-direction (e.g.; via eye-tracking) and brain activity (e.g.; via EEG or fNIRS); often collected simultaneously. We invite families to visit UBC campus to participate in our research with their infants; which involves active recruitment and the maintenance of a positive relationship with our local communities.

32011,Deep Neural Networks for Modeling Sensor Data,Deep learning is currently the pervasive neural network technique given its phenomenal performance in computer vision (Russakovsky; et al.; 2015); speech (Amodei; et al.; 2015) and natural language processing (Vinyals et al.; 2015). In most cases; the performance of these models is fueled by the presence of large datasets and availability of computational power. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are two of the most powerful and popular frameworks for modeling sequential data such as speech and text and images respectively.

32017,Deep Convolutional Neural Network Mechanisms for Wind Prediction and Safe UAV Flights,Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is becoming prevalent and essential in a variety of indoor and outdoor applications; for instance; transportation; terrain mapping; reef monitoring; search and rescue; delivery of medical supplies; and others. As such; robust and accurate autonomous localization techniques for UAVs free from human intervention are in great demand. Unfortunately; many of the above-mentioned applications may encounter unreliable Global Positioning Systems (GPS) signal. In this case; low-cost units (e.g.; inertial measurement unit (IMU) and vision unit) might be the only source for positioning measurements. A challenge imposed by use of low-cost units is presence of significantActivities uncertainties. Therefore; smart localization systems able to provide accurate UAV motion components (i.e.; orientation; position; and linear velocity) are critically needed. This project proposes autonomous localization techniques for UAVs based on Kalman filters (e.g.; Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs)) tightly coupled with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) able to ensure accurate estimation of UAV motion components. Commonly; GPS provides position and linear velocity information of a travelling vehicle. However; in this project; we propose developing an estimation technique that addresses GPS signal loss by using and IMU and a monocular or a stereo vision camera; estimates UAV motion components; minimizes localization errors; and reduces uncertainties associated with low-cost units.,HashimMohamed,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,- Basic knowledge of observer design and control systems - Good knowledge of linear algebra and mathematical analysis - Familiarity with the utilization/implementation of deep learning algorithms - Excellent programming skills (MATLAB; Python; etc.) - Self-motivation and ability to work independently,
32018,UAVs Rendezvous and Docking using Reinforcement Learning,Rendezvous and docking are essential tasks in aerospace and robotics applications. Rendezvous and docking manoeuvres are critical for vehicle fueling and assembly. Successful completion of these two tasks requires robust algorithms able to perform three subtasks: target detection; guidance; and control. Through sustained efforts of the research community many challenges associated with the three aforementioned subtasks have been addressed. In this project; we plan to utilize existing successful detection and control techniques while contributing to the vehicle guidance subtask. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which can be employed to teach an agent toActivities perform a specific task based on experience. In this project; we will propose a model-based RL approach constructed using artificial neural network that by maximizing vehicle reward is able to successfully perform the desired action. This will be done by carefully selecting a reward which facilitates agent learning of complex tasks through experience. Since training an unmanned vehicle to successfully perform rendezvous and docking is unviable in a real-time scenario (potential destabilization); we plan to train the policy using data obtained from physical models. Next; we plan to train and test the policy on a simulated platform to emulate real-life scenarios. The simulated platform will incorporate measurement uncertainties and disturbances. This way; the developed policy will be robust against disturbances and sensor uncertainties.,HashimMohamed,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,- Good knowledge of control systems (linear control / automatic control) - Familiarity with the utilization/implementation of machine-learning/reinforcement-learning algorithms - Solid background in linear algebra and mathematical analysis - Good knowledge of simulation platforms (MATLAB Simulink) - Excellent programming skills (MATLAB; Python; etc.) - Self-motivation and ability to work independently,

32021,UAV Perception based on Neural Networks Out-of-Distribution,Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are widely used for recognizing complex patterns and modeling nonlinear systems. ANNs have been successfully applied in various autonomous robotics applications (e.g.; autonomous cars and ground robots). However; trained ANNs may fail when faced with input data which is not well represented in the training set; commonly referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Algorithm failure can be detrimental for intolerant missions; including robotic applications. OOD data challenge is common for uninhabited aircrafts (drones) flying in low texture or foggy environments. Therefore; robust algorithms that can efficiently handle OOD data are of great importance mainly for safety reasons (e.g.; drone accidents). Majority of NNs utilize softmax normalization as a tool for confidence estimation. This approach can cause high confidence for OOD samples and consequently result in detection failure. To this end; two issues should be addressed: real-time computational cost and detection uncertainties. For computational cost reduction; this project proposes an OOD mechanism employing OOD samples Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based deep ANNs for sample identification. To address sample uncertainties; Monte Carlo (MC) dropout technique will be employed to measure uncertainties by applying dropout to ANN inference. The proposed mechanism will be validated using a publicly available real-world dataset.,HashimMohamed,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,- Basic knowledge of observer design and control systems - Good knowledge of linear algebra and mathematical analysis - Familiarity with the utilization/implementation of deep learning algorithms - Excellent programming skills (MATLAB; Python; etc.) - Self-motivation and ability to work independently,Engg-Aeronautical; Engg-Computer; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Software; Engineering; Engg-Systems and Technology

32025,Design and development of a lower limb exoskeleton for drop foot correction,This research project aims to develop a robotic exoskeleton for use by people with drop foot; a common symptom of neurological disease that results in weakened ankle dorsiflexion that can lead to the toe dragging on the ground during walking. Current treatment for drop foot includes the use of a passive ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) that provides support to the ankle through a rigid plastic device to hold the ankle in a neutral position during the swing phase of walking. There are several limitations to AFOs; primarily that they do not restore healthy biomechanics of the ankle but simply prevent excessive plantar flexion. In this project we aim to design a wearable robotic exoskeleton device that provides ankle dorsiflexion support through a variable stiffness mechanism. This project will be conducted in three phases: (1) literature review and prior art analysis; (2) design and development of the exoskeleton; and (3) clinical evaluation of the prototype. The Mitacs Globalink project will focus on the literature review; prior art analysis; and initial design stages. We will first review physiological behavior of the biological ankle through a literature review and research the pathological gait of drop foot. We will analyze existing passive AFOs and define the primary limitations. We will develop design requirements and corresponding technical specification for parameters such as device mass; function of actuators at ankle; required range of adjustable stiffness and damping properties; and battery life; and anthropomorphic shape and size. We will then implement parametric design models that take geometry; motor specifications; material selection; power source; maximum payload as inputs; and determine maximum stress on system; energy consumption; power output; device stiffness; and device mass as outputs. We will begin early exploration into design concept generation and 3D modeling.,EmilyRogers-Bradley,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,This project is suitable for a student with a strong background in mechanical engineering and design; and an interest in biomedical applications.

32028,Quantum Topological Data Analysis,Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is currently a very active field of research; and much of the recent progress comes from studying so-called persistent modules. The topological features of the data which "persist" are considered important aspects of the data set; and this information can be used gain knowledge; also using techniques from machine learning. These methods have successfully been applied in a number of areas ranging from medicine to cybersecurity. However; the methods to compute and study persistent modules are computationally expensive; and a speed-up would be much needed. This is where quantum computers might provide an advantage. The first goal of the project is to study and experiment how one can use quantum computers to calculate the rank invariant of a persistent module; which constitutes one of the most important ways to measure a persistent module. There are quantum algorithms that estimate ranks of hermitian matrices; but they need to be modified in order to apply it in the TDA context.,ThomasBrüstle,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-04-30,A good knowledge of linear algebra is required; as well as ability to implement and test new or existing methods on a computer.

32029,Relativistic quantum computing,Quantum computing employs qubits instead of bits and quantum logic gates instead of Boolean logic to deliver quantum advantage to information processing. Mathematically; we can think of qubits as represented by tensor products of length-2 complex vectors and gates as even-dimensional unitary matrices acting on these vectors; and the mathematics is akin to spin-1/2 systems in the Schrödinger-Pauli equation. In contrast to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics where Pauli essentially hacked Schrödinger's equation to incorporate spin-1/2 systems; Dirac's relativistic quantum equation necessarily incorporates spin-1/2 particles and also their antimatter counterparts. The mathematics of Dirac's equation is beautiful. This project is about extending the mathematics of quantum computing from the Pauli algebra to the Dirac algebra. Specifically; we will explore generalising the Solovay-Kitaev theorem to the Dirac algebra using undergraduate linear-algebra matrix/vector methods and interpret the results as quantum circuits that would necessarily involve both qubits and anti-qubits. This investigation is totally new so we are in for some surprises. I doubt we will build quantum computers with anti-qubits but we will sure get some new insights into tractability and intractability for a new concept of quantum computing.,BarrySanders,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-04-30,Must have taken courses on quantum mechanics including solving Schrödinger's equation; linear algebra including eigenvectors and spectra; and a basic computer science course.

32030,Investigating the Consumption of Gut Metabolites by Crohn's Disease-Associated Escherichia coli,Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease driven by gut bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals. Adherent invasive strains of Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been recognized as CD risk factors due to their pro-inflammatory traits. By evolving AIEC in the host environment; we identified the pro-inflammatory adaptations acquired by these bacteria. We have shown that these strains can rapidly evolve to consume short chain fatty acids (SCFA) faster than their ancestor. Given their anti-inflammatory role in the gut; the utilization of SCFA by AIEC promotes inflammation. We have recently identified several mutations in an evolved AIEC isolate that rewired its metabolism. This led to a trade-off between the metabolism of SCFA and other carbon sources; allowing AIEC to consume these immunomodulatory molecules that are abundant in the gut. Using transcriptomics; we have identified several transporters that are upregulated in the evolved AIEC lineages; suggesting a potential role in importing SCFA. The objective of this project is to identify and characterize the SCFA transporters in AIEC. We will knockout the putative transporters and test the ability of the mutants to grow on SCFA; like acetate and propionate; as sole carbon source. We expect the AIEC mutant lacking the required transporter to display poor growth under these conditions. The putative SCFA transporter will be cloned and purified using affinity chromatography. Binding of the purified transporter to SCFA will be tested using isothermal titration calorimetry. In addition; we will measure SCFA transport activity in vitro using standard biochemical assays.

32034,Deployable smart greenhouse inspired by origami,Urban agriculture is becoming increasingly popular in major cities as food prices continue to rise and more and more people are concern about sustainable development. To extend the growing season in colder climates; greenhouses are used to provide crops with a protected; light-transmitting; and heat-regulating environment. However; most greenhouses are clunky and expensive; limiting their usage to commercial applications. The aim of this project is to take inspiration from origami; the art of folding paper; to design a smart greenhouse for the urban population (e.g. Montrealers). This greenhouse will be easy to build; deploy and store; enabling citizens of large cities to grow fruit and vegetables on their balconies and/or terraces year-round.,DavidMelancon,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-06-03,To conduct this research project; the ideal student should be creative; self-driven; familiar with computer aided design; programming; the finite elements method; and prototyping via 3D printing and laser-cutting.,
32035,The Sticky Defense: Exploring Spruce Oleoresin's Role in Combating Fungal Pathogens,Plants constantly face the threat of infection by pathogenic fungi; which can cause severe disease outbreaks; leading to significant mortality in agricultural crops and forest trees. Outbreaks greatly impact essential resources such as food supplies and timber commodities. However; plants can defend themselves by producing toxic chemicals that may halt infections or kill pathogens. The effectiveness of these defenses can determine whether devastating disease outbreaks occur and damage natural resources. Local and provincial economies in Western Canada are in part dependent on sustainable resources from spruce (Picea spp.) forests. However; spruce trees in this area are under attack by Leptographium abietinum; a fungal pathogen transmitted by the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis). This pathogen has affected millions of trees in the past five years. The fungus-beetle symbiosis enables the fungus to infect tree vascular tissue once the beetle has penetrated the bark of susceptible host trees. The fungus rapidly spreads in the tree phloem; resulting in severe disease and tree death within as little as two years. In response to these infections; spruce trees produce significant amounts of oleoresin—a sticky sap rich in fungitoxic chemicals. While oleoresin consists of various terpenes; diterpenes are the most common and possess antifungal properties. The effects of spruce diterpenes on L. abietinum is currently unknown. This student project will address this crucial knowledge gap in the battle to protect Canadian forest resources destructive pathogens. The student will conduct a laboratory experiment investigating how different concentrations of defense-related spruce diterpenes affect the growth and reproduction of L. abietinum. The project's findings will provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying spruce resistance to infection. Furthermore; these findings will lay the groundwork for future studies that identify biomarkers for rapidly screening L. abietinum- and spruce beetle-resistant spruce trees—helping to safeguard valuable forest resources from loss.,JonathanCale,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,The student should have completed microbiology and general chemistry courses; with proficiency in aseptic technique; culturing; basic use of a light microscope; and chemical solution preparation.

32046,Robotic Collision Management apply in virtual reality for haptic rendering,A common issue of robotic mechanisms is the possibility of collisions with human and other object. However; it is known that these collisions between humans; the environment or robot manipulator can be managed. The issue coming from a collision is the modification of workspace size and geometry of the reachable area of the manipulator. This variation within the control system can generate efforts that will no longer balanced by the force deployed in each motor axes. Indeed; the solution of an optimal force distribution in the axes that distributes the force applied to the manipulator cannot converge to a solution. Thus; this project aims to determine a solution that eliminates the constraint collisions. Our preferred solution is the control the plane described between two interfered rigid body in order to minimize the error between the predicted trajectory and the trajectory that doesn’t allow two bodies in contact to be deformed. Finally; this strategy is highlighted by a haptic application where a user moves the manipulator toward a collision; then trying to interact with a virtual surface.,MartinOtis,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The candidate will design a new feedback loop in order to adjust the robot trajectory or the robot control law function of the collision plane.

32049,Design of Human-Robot Interaction using activities classification in the feedback loop,Human and Robot are usually not allowed to work together in the same workspace. When a human is found in the reachable workspace of the end-effector of the robot; it is usually stopped; which ends production. However; new industrial needs lead research to develop flexible and reactive chain production for enabling small quantity production or fast modification in product characteristics. Collaboration between human and robot sharing a common workspace (usually labelled as a hybrid work cell) could improve this flexibility. Nevertheless; human safety in human-robot interaction or collaboration is the main issue. This project aims to include our new sensors for human activities classification inside the motion control feedback of the robot in order to improve safety. The robot should know the current human activity in order to avoid collision (trajectory planning) or to change control parameters (such as damping) for physical interactions (pHRI). Robotic vision using camera is not used in this project since this solution does not seem appropriate in a real environment.,MartinOtis,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The candidate should know the design techniques of control law in order to include some new sensors inside the control feedback (MIMO control).

32054,Transport phenomena in nanoporous materials,The scientific community faces several important and urgent challenges: how to mitigate the risk posed by traditional energy sector on climate change by increasing capture and storage of greenhouse gases? How to transition to new energy systems that are not carbon based? How to reduce and clean pollution fueled by population and economic growth? How to produce clean potable water that is becoming scarcer because of global warming? Materials with specifically tailored transport and reaction properties are needed to address every one of these challenges. For example; a variety of filtration systems have been developed to treat brackish water and supply freshwater to remote areas; as well as to remove oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions; enabling water recycling; environmental protection and land reclamation. Different types of polymer electrolyte membranes are synthesized to separate CO2 from post-combustion gas mixtures; for carbon capture and storage. The performance of low-temperature fuel cells and electrolysers depends on polymer electrolyte membranes to selectively conduct ions to steer the transport of ions; gas; water molecules; and promote key reactions. Despite a large variability of nanoporous structures used in these applications; they share basic requirements defining their function and operation: the transport behavior of ions and solvent; the selectivity to reject undesired species and suppress parasitic reactions; and the resistance to aging and failure. It remains a challenge for materials design and optimization to balance these requirements. To address this challenge; a holistic approach is required that targets the fundamental understanding of surface interactions; selective ion and solvent transport; and overall performance and lifetime. This project will host two students who will investigate transport phenomena in nanoporous materials using molecular dynamics simulation and mean-field (continuum) theories; respectively.,TianTang,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Both students are expected to have completed courses in calculus; dynamics; fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.

32056,EEG markers of pain,Pain is a universal human experience and a fundamental driver of behaviour. However; its perception is subjective and highly influenced by multiple factors such as past experience; mood; and emotions. Unfortunately; the neural mechanisms giving rise to this subjective experience remain poorly understood; and our capacity to quantify pain from brain activity remains limited. This issue has led to calls for brain-based pain biomarkers; which would represent a valuable measurement tool for future research and provide crucial insights into how neural activity gives rise to the subjective pain percept. Many efforts have been dedicated to developing electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of pain since EEG systems have high relevance due to their wide availability; relatively low costs; ease of use; few contraindications; and high test-retest reliability. However; these attempts have been hindered by the use of small datasets and the use of univariate analyses ignoring the rich multivariate nature of electrical brain signals. The validity and reliability of previously published markers thus remain unclear. The overarching goal of this research project is to identify reliable; sensitive; specific; and interpretable predictive models capable of using brain activity to predict pain perception across individuals and pain experiences. During this project; the student will use a large database of EEG recordings in various states of pain and control conditions currently being collected in my lab; to develop; validate and interpret machine learning models of EEG data capable of predicting pain perception across participants and modalities. The identification of accurate predictive models will provide crucial scientific insights into how subjective pain perception is encoded in the brain and the general capacity of machine learning models to decode subjective experiences from brain activity.,Michel-PierreColl,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Students from all areas related to the project (psychology; neuroscience; machine learning; computer science; etc.) are welcome to apply.

32057,Walking into a Virtual World: A Pilot Randomized Trial using Virtual Reality and Omnidirectional Treadmill Training for People with Chronic Stroke,Cognitive function (thinking; memory; and concentration); balance; and walking problems affect the lives of many stroke survivors. Virtual reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment that can be explored in 360 degrees. VR has been introduced to the field of rehabilitation to promote improvements in cognitive function; walking ability; and balance. A new type of treadmill technology called an omnidirectional treadmill has emerged that allows for movement in all directions and is compatible with VR technology. The largest advantage of combining omnidirectional treadmill training with VR is to allow the user to challenge their walking and balance in a safe environment. Some previous research has indicated that VR may be more enjoyable and engaging for stroke survivors than traditional exercise. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether VR combined with omnidirectional treadmill training is enjoyable and feasible for stroke survivors who had a stroke more than 6 months previously and have problems with walking. Our secondary objectives are to estimate how much cognitive function; brain activation; walking ability; and balance change after 12 weeks of omnidirectional treadmill training with virtual reality in comparison with a traditional exercise program. We will recruit 30 participants from rehabilitation facilities; clinics; and stroke recovery clubs in Halifax; Nova Scotia. Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group will participate in VR on the omnidirectional treadmill 3 times per week for 45 minutes for 12 weeks total; while the control group will participate in a traditional exercise program consisting of strengthening and walking activities for the same amount of time. If successful; this affordable and accessible technology could be used to improve rehabilitation for stroke survivors and may change our understanding of how the brain works during real-world activities like walking and talking.,AdriaQuigley,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,Ideally this student will have a background in physiotherapy or a related field (occupational therapy; nursing; medicine) or they will have experience working with virtual reality or omnidirectional treadmill (or related) technology.

32059,Investigation of electrospun nanofibers for food packaging application,Effective distribution of fresh fruits and vegetables remains a complex challenge in many developing countries due to the lack of optimal preservation and packaging systems. One of the most pressing issues to be resolved is the proliferation of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms that can result in substantial product loss and pose health/safety concerns for the consumers; in addition to generating food waste that impacts the environment. One of the strategies to preserve fresh produce is to apply active packaging (AP) concept to enhance product stability in the distribution chain. AP systems typically consist of one or more active components capable of interacting with the product and/or ambient factors (humidity; temperature; oxygen); which in turn elicits an action beneficial to protect the product. For example; antimicrobial AP systems are capable of releasing antimicrobial volatile compounds; such as essential oils (EOs) from plants/herbs; into the package headspace and/or the food to increase the product shelf life. The efficacy of antimicrobial AP is determined by the stability of EO and its release rate; and therefore the EO must be encapsulated in an optimal polymeric carrier structure. Nonwovens prepared from electrospun fibers have large surface area and can be produced using non-thermal processes; making these materials an ideal substrate for AP applications. This project aims to explore electrospun nonwovens from naturally occurring biopolymers (proteins and polysaccharides) that are edible or biodegradable for the encapsulation of volatile antimicrobial for postharvest preservation of fresh fruits and vegetables. EO-laced antimicrobial electrospun nonwovens will be developed and characterized for their antifungal activity against typical spoilage microorganisms. The microstructures of the electrospun fibers will be examined using electron and fluorescence microscopies by SEM. EOs release kinetics will be evaluated using headspace gas chromatography. Selected high-value fresh fruits that are perishable will be tested in commercially available packages.,Loong-TakLim,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,The interns ideally should have senior year food; chemistry; engineering; and/or material science backgrounds; with strong academic standings.

32076,Additive manufacturing of multifunctional composites and smart systems,Additive manufacturing; also known as 3D printing; has already proven its potential to manufacture small low-cost polymer composite parts; especially with the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) method. However; there is a high interest to manufacture high-performance industrial parts made of lighter; stiffer and stronger materials. One of the challenges is to 3D print components with desired geometries using a non-planar approach instead of a succession of planar layers to benefit from the anisotropic behavior of FFF. Another challenge is to 3D print large parts (~1m × ~1m) and especially using high-performance polymers and composites. The Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics (LM2) at Polytechnique Montreal has recently developed a 6-axis robotic platform with a custom-made FFF printing system with a non-planar toolpath generator. However; we have not yet mechanically characterized some 3D printed samples comparing the benefits of non-planar additive manufacturing at high volumetric flowrates for large components. The challenge is now to succeed in printing and characterizing such components. The aim of the internship(s) is to improve the mechanical performance of the FFF 3D printing process by 3D printing and characterizing non-planar geometries.

32077,Lightweight structural materials for automotive and aerospace applications,The automotive and aerospace industry is facing a significant challenge in reducing the weight of vehicles to improve fuel economy and reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions without compromising safety and reliability. The reduction of vehicle weight can be best achieved via combining the use of lightweight materials with innovative manufacturing and structural design. Lightweight structural materials include magnesium alloys; aluminum alloys and titanium alloys; as well as aluminum- or titanium-containing novel high-entropy alloys. The application of these alloys inevitably involves welding; which is one of key joining techniques in manufacturing critical engineering components in the automotive and aerospace industry. Ultrasonic spot welding and friction stir welding; being promising solid-state joining techniques; have been referred to as “green” technology by some researchers due to their energy efficiency and environment friendliness. They are enabling technology for joining lightweight magnesium and aluminum alloys which were classified as unweldable by traditional fusion welding. They are thus considered by many researchers to be the most significant development in the area of materials joining. The objective of this project is to identify the relationships among the welding parameters; microstructures; and mechanical properties of ultrasonic spot welded and friction stir welded magnesium alloys; so as to promote the applications of the solid-state joining technology and lightweight alloys in Canadian manufacturing industry.,DaolunChen,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,Enthusiasm required.

32078,Design of a low-power edge computing circuit for an AI-driven fall descent algorithm,In North America; more than 330;000 seniors per year suffer a hip fracture; the most common injury in this segment of the population. In fact; one-third will suffer a fall and the impact of these falls accounts for more than 95% of fractures. Once a hip fracture occurs; 20% die within a year. In order to prevent hip fractures; we developed an intelligent wearable garment that detects a fall before impact and deploys an airbag that uses an AI driven fall descent algorithm that need to be embedded.

32079,Verticillium longisporum, a new threat to canola in Canada,Verticillium Stripe disease caused by Verticillium longisporum was firstly identified in canola field from Manitoba in 2015 and now has spread to most of the canola production area in Canada including Alberta; Saskatchewan; and Ontario. Verticillium longisporum has three lineages A1/D1; A1/D2; and A1/D3; and previous studies demonstrated that they exhibited different pathogenicity Brassica species. Unfortunately; we found all three V. longisporum lineages in canola fields across Canada; and Vl A1/D1 was the predominant strain. Canola is the most important cash crop in Canada; and it will be noteworthy to understand the pathogenicity variations on canola plant; particularly on both susceptible and resistant canola varieties. In this project; we will inoculate three Vl isolates from lineages A1/D1; A1/D2; and A1/D3 onto both Westar (a susceptible canola variety); and Quinta (a resistance canola variety). Root-dipping method will be used for disease inoculation. Briefly; 4 week old seedlings will be pulled out from the soil; and washed under tap water. Then we will cut the root tips and dip roots into prepared V. longisporum inoculum. The three V. longisporum isolates were recovered from filed collection and cultured in PDA plate. At maturity stage; the disease severity will be assessed through a widely used rating system from score 0-4 by infection size; presence of microsclerotia; and other disease symptoms. Infected plant tissues will be sampled for DNA and RNA extraction for gene expression analysis. We will investigate the expression of plant defense related genes by quantification real-time PCR; such as PR1; PDF1.2; PR2; PR5; PR4; MYC2; etc; participated salicylic and jasmonic acid signal pathways. The main objectives of this study are 1) the pathogenicity difference between three different V. longisporum lineages on susceptible and resistant canola; 2) how canola plant defense related genes respond to V. longisporum infection.,ZhongweiZou,Ontario,Wilfrid Laurier University,English,2024-05-01,Students from agricultural science; plant science; crop science; and biological science are a good fit for the project.

32080,Development of an intelligent conversational agent to support patients living with HIV: MARVIN,After 40 years of the HIV pandemic; there is still no cure or vaccine; but effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV). However; to this day; PLHIVs still require lifelong monitoring; self-management; and adherence to treatment to maintain an undetectable HIV viral load and thus avoid complications and transmission of the virus. Self-management is essential for longevity and health-related quality of life. Mobile health (mHealth); the use of mobile devices (e.g.; smartphones) for health practices and self-care; offers promising solutions for empowering users and giving patients greater control over their health management. One of the most promising avenues for mHealth is the emergence of Chatbots; which have proven to be an acceptable medium for the general public. Chatbots in general act as virtual assistants that talk to users; using advanced artificial intelligence methods to understand their requests and respond appropriately. In 2020; my research team at Polytechnique Montreal; in collaboration with the McGill University Health Centre; developed a first version of a Chatbot called MARVIN that supports PLHIVs by answering basic ART-related questions to help PLHIVs improve treatment adherence. Because PLHIVs have limited contact with caregivers; much of the time and effort required for HIV management and associated behavior change is borne daily by patients and their informal caregivers. By talking to an on-call Chatbot; PLHIVs can obtain the information they need for self-management.,SofianeAchiche,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Experience in computer programming and artificial intelligence.

32082,Development of an artificial intelligence informed E-health behaviour change platform,It has been shown that poor health behaviours; e.g.; physical inactivity; poor diet; smoking; account for approximately 80% of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). Achieving and maintaining longterm health behaviour change is a complex process; but at its core is knowledge of what behaviours to engage in; greater intrinsic motivation to engage in them; and increased self-efficacy in one’s ability to maintain change. Motivational communication (MC) is an evidence-based; patient-centred communication style designed to be used as an adjunct to established behaviour change interventions. For MC to be effective in face-to-face interventions; it is important to use non-verbal cues; e.g.; facial expressions and tone of response; to evaluate the discordance between an individual’s desire vs. barriers to change a behaviour. Recent advances in the processing of multimodal emotion data using complex nonlinear interactions; e.g.; deep learning architectures; convolutional neural networks; adaptive multiple classifier systems; and partially supervised learning; provides a potential opportunity to translate MC into an eHealth solution. However; the majority of the work on multimodal emotion recognition has been developed using contrived scenarios with actors and not using real-world populations. As such; the integration of these kinds of algorithms into a service-oriented architecture that may also be commercially viable; and that also provides an effective behaviour change solution; is a notable challenge. In the current application; we will capture video and voice responses to specific questions around an individual’s progress with achieving their behaviour change goals from individuals participating in a previously developed eHealth behaviour change platform. Data will be captured through handheld device videos and will occur throughout the program. This will allow us the capacity to adapt and enhance the inter- and intra-person algorithms using multimodal data.,SimonBacon,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-20,Students with either an engineering/computer science or behaviour change background are required for this project.

For those with a behaviour change/behavioural science background prior experience with any of the following would be an asset: the development of a behaviour change intervention; delivery of one to one counselling for behaviour change; coding facial expressions; training in motivational communication or interviewing; and/or ecological momentary assessment.,
32083,Quantum Raychaudhuri Equation, Singularities and the Quantum Origin of Lambda,Classical gravity (general relativity) suffers from spacetime singularities; as predicted by the Raychaudhuri equation and the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems. The quantum Raychaudhuri equation (QRE) provides one way to remove the singularities by replacing classical geodesics with quantal trajectories. The QRE also predicts the corrected Friedmann equation in cosmology; with the correction term dependent on the wavefunction of the perfect fluid filling the Universe. Postulating that this fluid is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of light bosons; one can show that the correction term can give rise to a cosmological constant of the observed value; for a suitable choice of the wavefunction. The project will critically study the mathematical and physical aspects of the above equations; including their action formulation and matching their predictions with available cosmological data.

32086,Gravity as an emergent phenomenon: new developments,Quantum mechanics and general relativity are two of the most successful physical theories. Yet they are apparently incompatible; and despite several attempts; a successful quantum theory of the gravitational field is yet to be formulated. An alternative approach is to consider gravity not as a fundamental interaction; but one derived from an underlying; possibly quantum theory. Recently we made progress in this idea and showed that indeed gravity and for that matter any observable interaction can be derived as the `quantum potential' of a suitable underlying wavefunction [1;2]. In this project; we will study this idea further; embed our theory in a fully covariant framework; compute corrections to the well known gravitational potentials and other measurable predictions.

32087,An alternative to Dark Matter,The Universe apparently contains more matter than is visible or detectable by direct experiments. This is because the observable effects of gravity at astrophysical and cosmological scales appear stronger than that provided by visible matter. The missing 25% of matter in the Universe is known as Dark Matter. However; it is possible that visible matter simply exerts a stronger gravitational force than predicted by the standard theory (Newtonian or relativistic); which matches all observations; and that there is no need for dark matter. We recently showed that the Newtonian gravitational potential; augmented by a logarithmic term; can precisely provide this extra gravity to explain observations at the various length scales [1;2]. In this project; we will examine the origin of such a potential; ways to embed it in a covariant theory; and its theoretical and observational implications. Reference: [1] S. Das; S.

32088,On the superluminal propagation of signals,The theory of relativity stipulates that the maximum speed of propagation of any signal is c; the speed of light in vacuum. Yet; there have been many attempts to construct theoretical models in which signal propagation can exceed this speed. One common requirement in these models is that the systems under question must be quantum in nature. We will examine these models; the criticisms thereof; and potential ways of addressing those concerns to construct a viable model for superluminal signal propagation. We will study potential ways of testing this proposal and its its implications.,SauryaDas,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,The student should know quantum mechanics.

32089,Intent-Negotiation Framework for Autonomous Network and Cloud Service Management,To automate network operations and deployment of compute services; intent-driven service management (IDSM) is essential. It enables the network and compute service users to express their service requirements in a declarative manner as intents. To fulfill the intents; closed control-loop operations carry out required configurations and deployments without human intervention. Despite the fact that intents are fulfilled automatically; conflicts may arise between user’s and service provider’s intents due to limited resources availability. This triggers IDSM system to initialize an intent negotiation process among conflicting actors. Intent negotiation involves generating one or more alternate intents based on the current state of the underlying physical/virtual resources; which are then presented to the intent creator for acceptance or rejection. In this way; the quality of services (QoS) can be improved significantly by maximizing the acceptance rate of service requests in the scenario of limited resources. However; the concept of intent negotiation in IDSM is still in its infancy. The available solutions are platform dependent which poses various challenges in their adoption to diverse platforms. Such that the intent-negotiation solution developed for OpenStack can not be adopted for Kubernetes and vice versa. Hence; the main objective of this project is to design a comprehensive and generic intent negotiation framework which can be used to develop intent negotiation solutions for diverse hierarchical and multi-domain IDSM platforms.,YogeshSharma,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,A student must have a background in computer science; computer engineering or information technology.

However; communication from users to HAPS (Uplink) is minimal due to the low transmit power of user devices; which may prevent the HAPS paradigm from offering novel applications requiring high uplink throughput; such as virtual/augmented reality. To tackle this issue; we propose in this project to enable transmissions through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) installed within the vicinity of users. The RIS is a novel paradigm suggesting manipulating the radio frequency (RF) signals and reflecting them in a controlled manner in order to improve the quality of communications. The reduced cost; low power use; lightweight; and flexible deployment of RIS make it an attractive candidate for integration within HAPS systems. Consequently; in this project; we propose investigating the use of RIS for HAPS uplink transmissions. The objective is to provide optimized transmit power control; RIS locations; and phase-shift configurations; aiming to maximize users' transmissions' uplink weighted sum rate. The joint optimization of these parameters will be conducted through novel optimization and/or machine learning-based methods.,WaelJaafar,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-06,- Familiar with the utilization/implementation of algorithms - Excellent programming skills (Matlab; Python; etc.) - Understand wireless communication fundamentals - Familiar with operational research (e.g.; problem formulation and solving) - Good mathematical analysis background - Self-motivated and autonomous working,Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Engg-Electrical
32093,Estimating Berry Species Distributions in the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone,The goal of this research project is to estimate berry species distributions in the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone; which spans eastern Canada; using species distribution models (SDMs) under climate change scenarios. These wild berry species can support resilience to climate change through their disease and pest resistance; nutritional quality; and other traits such as adaption to differing environments. Plant biodiversity is the foundation of plant breeding and conservation of native plant species is a necessary component of ensuring diversity is available for continual improvement of fruit crops. Agriculture sustainability requires that we develop crops better-suited to our changing climate; improving resistance/tolerance to pests and disease as well as reducing the need for continued agricultural expansion. The goal of estimating SDMs in this research project is to aide in safeguarding berry species in the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone; by improving our understanding of berry species in this region (including abundance); assessing their vulnerability to climate change; and proposing strategies/providing recommendations to help ensure these species are protected. This work will be performed in collaboration with the University seed bank and herbarium; who will be collecting seeds of these species for conservation in the seed bank. It will also be supported by a larger group of berry researchers from across Canada working towards similar goals in their regions.,ZoëMigicovsky,Nova Scotia,Acadia University,English,2024-05-06,The student should be experienced with the R programming language and reproducible research practices.

32095,Visualization of educational data in online learning,Educational institutions capture huge amounts of educational data; especially in online learning. Data mining techniques have shown promises to interpret these data using different patterns. However; understanding the mining patterns and extracting meaningful information from the data require reasonable skills and knowledge for the users. Information visualization; due to its potential to display large amount of data; may fill this gap. In this research project; we will analyze various visualization techniques to represent meaningful information from the educational data; especially dealing with monitoring student performance; understanding learning style; analyzing course and program status; and dropout prediction. We will develop a learner- or instructor-focused effective visualization system for online learning environment.,Mohammad AliDewan,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Programming experiences and skills in Python; Java; and D3 Experience and ability to design and build tools or systems Experience in designing user interfaces and data visualization Student must have knowledge in data mining; machine learning; and pattern classification Experience in information collection; re-organization; summarization; and preparing reports Good communication skill,
32096,Early dropout prediction in e-learning courses using machine learning,High dropout rate is a major concern for many universities that offer online courses. If the dropout-prone students can be identified at their early stages of learning; the dropout rate can be reduced by providing individualized support to the students at-risk. Due to the electronic nature of the learning management systems (LMS); various attributes of the students’ progress can be monitored and analyzed over time. The main objective of this project is to explore what progress information about a student can be used from LMS and how this information can be used with a classification model to predict the students at risk. Different machine learning and deep learning methods will be investigated for early dropout prediction in this research project.,Mohammad AliDewan,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Programming experiences and skills in Matlab or Python Experience and ability to design and build tools or systems Experience in designing user interfaces and data visualization Student must have knowledge in image processing; computer vision; machine learning; and pattern classification.

32097,Pedagogical Intervention Design for Online Learners,Designing pedagogical interventions based on student's engagement detection is a challenging research problem. In this research; we will explore the use of engagement detection and learning analytics to automate personalized pedagogical support for online learners; specifically to answer the following questions: at what point and with what frequency should the students be consulted? why are they being consulted? what intervention should be provided? How will the pedagogical interventions integrate with the rest of the teaching and learning practices? We will investigate this area and develop a demo program on pedagogical intervention for the online learners.,Mohammad AliDewan,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Programming experiences and skills in Matlab or Python Experience and ability to design and build tools or systems Experience in designing user interfaces and data visualization Student must have knowledge in machine learning and pattern classification Experience in information collection; re-organization; summarization; and preparing reports Good communication skill,Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Engg-Software; Engg-Systems and Technology

32099,Testing Deep Learning Libraries,Deep Learning (DL) techniques are widely applied to solve important real-world problems; such as image and voice recognition; and autonomous driving cars. Due to the complexity and wide application of DL techniques; practitioners build DL libraries to make DL algorithms more accessible to application developers. Modern DL applications largely depend on popular DL libraries; e.g.; TensorFlow; PyTorch; Theano and Keras. The quality assurance of DL libraries is critical as it affects millions of applications that are built on top of them. However; there has been little attention to study the quality assurance activities in DL libraries (i.e.; the test suites by DL libraries’ developers). Such test cases guarantee the correctness of the implementations in DL libraries. Insufficient or low-quality test suites affects the quality of DL libraries. Furthermore; the generated models from DL libraries can be problematic as well. DL libraries; especially the core algorithm module; heavily encode mathematical formulas and arithmetic operations. The corresponding test suites of DL libraries have unique characteristics; which are not studied by prior studies on software quality-assurance activities. To better guarantee the quality of DL libraries which are the backbones of modern DL applications; my students and I will perform studies to understand the unique challenges in the current test practices in DL libraries; and propose novel automated solutions to overcome the discovered challenges. For instance; improving the coverage of test suites in DL libraries may better guarantee the quality; however; the traditional coverage metrics may be less relevant in the context of DL libraries. Another example from the perspective of test execution is that the prevalence of test flakiness should be examined in DL libraries. New techniques should be developed to assist developers in maintaining testing practices and detect test flakiness.,JinqiuYang,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-31,I am looking for students who are self-motivated and eager to learn in the domain of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. The student should have excellent communication skills and is able to collaborate with other graduate students.

The student should be very familiar with at least one of the object-oriented programming language (e.g.; Java or C++); and at least one scripting language (e.g.; Python; Bash). In addition; the student should be comfortable in working under Ubuntu,
32100,Advancing Super-Resolution Imaging Using Computational Modelling and Deep Learning,Super-resolution microscopy is an exciting new advance in optical imaging that allows for visualization of cells and tissues with unprecedented levels of detail. Generating a super-resolution image requires a significant amount of computational image reconstruction and the quality of the final data often depends strongly on the reconstruction strategy. In this project; the student will develop a simulation of STORM (Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy) images which can be used to investigate how different imaging and reconstruction parameters change the resolution of the final image and the potential for introducing image artifacts. When completed the simulation will be calibrated and compared with experimental data gathered using a Total Internal Reflection Microscope. Deep Neural Networks (DNN); one of the most popular Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining more popularity among different scientific applications. Deep neural learning will be used to help with image classification.

32108,Digital workflows for Adaptive Reuse of Historic Buildings,Carleton is one of the 14 universities involved in the SSHRC: Quality in the Built Environment partnership; with a research team; made up of graduate students and professors across the Azrieli School of Architecture and Urbanism and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Carleton’s research site explores the topic of Adaptive Reuse for a Sustainable Future; which looks at: the prevalence; impacts of; and barriers to the adaptive reuse of existing and historic buildings; definitions and methodologies of assessing quality in adaptive reuse; and potential synergies between adaptive reuse and wider social and environmental goals. Adaptive reuse is becoming an increasingly valuable tool as we observe the upsurge in vacant and underutilized buildings across multiple building typologies such as office buildings; sacred buildings and industrial buildings. Paired with a culture of “throw-away;” our built environment is subject to cycles of demolition and new construction; resulting in significant environmental impacts alongside the loss of character and social cohesion of neighborhoods. Carleton’s research seeks to determine the potential benefits of building reuse over new construction and assesses how to achieve them through quality design. In other words; how can existing buildings be adapted to new typologies while sustaining socio-cultural and economic relevance and heritage values and avoiding the waste of vast amounts of materials and embodied energy.,MarioSantana Quintero,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-06,Preferably and architectural or civil engineering student with good digital skills; such as Computer-Aided Drawing (CAD); Building Information Modeling; and Image processing (e.g. photoshop).

32109,Resolving Time Travel Paradoxes,In general relativity; there are some spacetime geometries which seem to allow time travel. If these geometries are realistic; and time travel is possible; then it will lead to consistency paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox. In this project; we will attempt to resolve time travel paradoxes using either the Novikov conjecture; the multiple-history approach; or something completely different. Specifically with regards to the multiple-history approach; we may work on providing a physical mechanism for the creation of additional histories when time travel occurs; or a mathematical model for a spacetime that can accommodate multiple histories.,BarakShoshany,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have good knowledge of differential geometry and general relativity; or at least have good knowledge of the relevant background from mathematics and physics and be willing to spend a few months studying differential geometry and general relativity from a textbook before the project starts.

32110,The Relation Between Time Travel And Faster-Than-Light Travel,In general relativity; there are some spacetime geometries which seem to allow time travel and/or faster-than-light travel. It is well-known that time travel and FTL travel are related; in that having access to one may allow you to do the other. However; it is not known to what extent; exactly; this relation applies. In particular; does having access to FTL travel *always* allow you to travel back in time? If so; how far in time can you travel; and how is that related to the maximum FTL speed you can attain? If not; then what are the exact conditions that allow time travel? In this project; we will attempt to answer some or all of these questions.,BarakShoshany,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have good knowledge of differential geometry and general relativity; or at least have good knowledge of the relevant background from mathematics and physics and be willing to spend a few months studying differential geometry and general relativity from a textbook before the project starts.

32111,Faster-Than-Light Travel In General Relativity,In general relativity; there are some spacetime geometries which seem to allow faster-than-light travel. However; these geometries generally require matter with negative energy to create them; and such matter does not appear to exist in our universe (except in small quantities due to quantum effects). In this project; we will attempt to find a realistic spacetime geometry which will allow FTL travel; but without requiring negative energy. This could be done either by modifying existing geometries; or by creating a whole new geometry of our own.,BarakShoshany,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have good knowledge of differential geometry and general relativity; or at least have good knowledge of the relevant background from mathematics and physics and be willing to spend a few months studying differential geometry and general relativity from a textbook before the project starts.

32115,Automated Detection and Visualization of Anti-Social Behaviour in Social Media,Online anti-social behaviour; commonly manifesting as cyberbullying and trolling; has been present since the early days of the Internet; but with the advent of social media; the number of people exposed to it has risen exponentially. Thus; the long-term objective of this work is to: Develop computational models to measure the hostility level and overall ‘social health’ of online groups and platforms. Such models can then be integrated with existing social networking platforms to empower moderators with the next generation administrative tools that would provide real time insights about the ‘health’ of an online community and predict its future lifecycle and viability. It would allow moderators to see what topics and what users (or group of users) are more likely to support hostile discussions; engage in trolling or cyberbullying; and take appropriate and targeted measures without necessarily blocking the whole discussion board or moderating individual messages. Related to this proposal; the short-term objective is to develop and validate detection models to identify troll- and bully-type accounts on four major social media platforms: Twitter; Facebook; reddit; and YouTube. In particular; we will examine politically-motivated discussions on topics such as climate change; elections; vaccination; refugees; and race which are known to attract a higher than usual amount of verbal abuse; attacks and harassment. The expected outcome will be three-fold: (1) computational models and an open-source library to detect instances and accounts that exhibit anti-social behaviour; (2) a generalized topology of anti-social behaviours; and (3) a set of datasets representing the ground truth that can be used by other researchers.,AnatoliyGruzd,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-20,Applicants are expected to have strong technical; research and communication skills; a passion for data analysis and demonstrable expertise in web development and programming using languages such as Python and R.

32116,Synthetic biology : using metabolic engineering for the production of valuable plant molecules./ Biologie synthétique : utilisation de l’ingénierie métabolique pour la production de molécules végétales de valeur.,Alkaloids constitute a diverse class of natural products and due to their potent biological activity; many are commercially exploited. Most alkaloids are derived from amino acids and characterized by a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. Recently; the alkaloids produced by Amaryllidaceae plants (e.g. Narcissus (daffodils) and Galanthus (snowdrops)) have been attracting increasing interest due to their multiple biological activities. For example; Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids (AAs) such as lycorine act as pesticides; haemanthamine and narciclasine possess anti-cancer properties whereas galanthamine is used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The commercial development of AAs is restricted to limited availability due to low amount in planta (only galanthamine is produced commercially). Although there are obvious interests in engineering AA production; for crop improvement or development of pharmaceuticals; the lack of information on AA regulation and biosynthetic pathways make this task very challenging; no biosynthetic genes have been identified yet. An improved molecular understanding of AA biosynthesis will contribute to engineered plants with valuable AA profiles and pave the way for biotechnologies such as synthetic biology to improve production and availability. The overall aim of the proposed research is to increase knowledge on the metabolism and regulation of AAs in plants; with special reference to the establishment of ‘omic’ databases to facilitate discovery of novel genes involved in AA biosynthesis in Amaryllidaceae. It should be noted that the project could relate to another type of molecules (cannabinoids; phenolics; etc.) with the same objectives due to the research funding obtained.,IsabelDesgagné-Penix,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Knowledge of DNA cloning; molecular biology and biochemistry techniques.

La très grande majorité des infrastructures en béton exposées aux intempéries (les ponts en particulier) sont fissurées en service; ceci facilite l’entrée d’agents agressifs dans le béton et favorise leur détérioration. Afin d’améliorer la durabilité des infrastructures; il importe d’utiliser de nouvelles gammes de béton plus durables et plus résistante à la fissuration. Au cours des 20 dernières années de nouvelles gammes de bétons plus durables ont été mis au point; en particulier les bétons fibrés à haute et ultra-haute performances. Ces bétons sont plus durables car ils contiennent de petites fibres métalliques ou synthétiques qui permettent de renforcer le béton et de limiter l'ouverture des fissures en conditions de service.

32120,Medical diagnosis with thermal image processing,The nervous system in the skin controls the flow of blood and the thermal emission of the skin. They can be captured using the thermal camera. At normal temperature; the human body acts as a perfect transmitter of infrared radiation; these radiations emanating from the tissue can be captured by thermal imaging cameras. Infrared thermography (IRT) in the field of medicine is a non-intrusive and radiation-free technology to monitor the physiological functions of skin temperature control. The effectiveness; safety and low cost of IRT make it a useful auxiliary tool for detecting and locating thermal abnormalities characterized by increases or decreases in the surface temperature of the skin. These thermal abnormalities can be used to find the type and extent of injuries in athletes In sports medicine; IRT can be used to identify risk factors and prevent future injuries during training and during competition. It can also be used to stop Injuries from excessive wear. It can also be used to detect any disruption of the normal symmetry of any part of the body and help to find the body's response for treatment. Sports players are often required to play matches continuously in a season; this continuous stress will lead to the muscle fatigue in the players. The Players need to have sufficient rest for the muscles to recover from the fatigue. If the players are not given enough rest the fatigue will lead to injuries. The main aim of the project is to track the muscle fatigue by taking the muscle temperature using thermal imaging and help the management in maintaining the fatigue and avoid muscle injuries due to extreme fatigue.,AhmedLakhssassi,Québec,Université du Québec en Outaouais,English,2024-05-06,The objectives of the Projects are • Perform feature extraction from the thermal images/ videos. • Find the hottest spot of the body or a specific Region of Interest. • Compare the Region of interest with the player’s previous thermal images. • Build the patient thermographic profile of the player during his training and playing matches. In this project; the student will be involved for Image processing and collecting thermal images of players.,Computer Science; Engg-Biomedical

32122,Monitoring and modelling of sediment transport in combined sewer systems under intensive rain events,In the project the combined sewer system of the City of Québec is being studied by the modelEAU research team to collect large data sets about the sediments as they move from the source (e.g. households and roads) to the wastewater treatment plant. Sediments are mobilized by the wastewater flow; with increased mobilization under higher flows thanks to increased shear stress. Under intense rain events the transport is extremely high leading to the so-called first flush. More importantly; under storm events the hydraulic capacity of the sewer system is exceeded and direct discharge of untreated wastewater in the river is the result; impacting water quality severely. Extensive experimental work will be conducted to (i) characterize the sediments using a novel experimental method that provides a distribution of settling velocities and (ii) to use automated measurement stations with turbidity sensors to quantify the transport of particles with the water flow. Mathematical models of the transport process will be developed within the WEST urban wastewater simulator (mikebydhi.com) and it will be tried to fit the newly developed models to the collected data.,PeterVanrolleghem,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,The student should have some background regarding sewer systems and wastewater quality; and have some laboratory experience.

To improve the process understanding these data are collected under different operating conditions (flow rates; temperatures; additions of chemicals; ...). Mathematical models of the process are developed within the WEST wastewater treatment plant simulator (mikebydhi.com) and it is tried to fit the models to the collected data. Once this is achieved the model is used to try to optimize the process by changing certain process settings such as flow rates; aeration conditions; chemical additions; process control strategies; ...,PeterVanrolleghem,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,The student should have some background in wastewater treatment and some laboratory experience.

32124,Improving the performance of the Advanced LIGO detectors,Gravitational-wave (GW) detector data; including the LIGO detectors; often contains a high rate of instrumental artifacts that can mask or mimic true astrophysical GW signals. This project will characterize noise sources in the Advanced LIGO detectors with the goal of reducing the number of 'false alarm' GW candidates and improving the reach of GW searches for the next observing run; which will be still underway in Summer 2024. Student researchers will apply current data analysis techniques to identify and investigate the sources of transient noise sources in LIGO data; with the goal of directing commissioners at the LIGO sites to fix identified instrument issues; or mitigate the impact of characterized noise with data post-processing. This work is critical to maximizing the confident recovery of GW events; especially those identified in near-real-time; which are of great interest to astronomers searching for electromagnetic counterparts to GW events.

32126,Techno-economic analysis of combined concentrating photovoltaic solar and compressed thermal energy storage systems,Solar energy is a widely available resource with the potential to meet a significant portion of the world's energy demand. To make it cost competitive with other sources of energy; novel approaches to harnessing and using solar energy are required. Moreover; solar energy is intermittent; available when the sun is out and not available during cloudy days and at night. As such a means of storing energy for late use becomes critical to extend the usage time of solar energy. In this project; combined high temperature photovoltaic thermal systems (PVT) will be developed; modelled and optimized. The thermal energy from the thermal side of the system will be upgraded; stored and used in an Organic Rankine cycle for power generation. The project will focus on the two linear concentrating technologies - the parabolic trough collector system and the linear Fresnel collector system.,AggreyMwesigye,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,Understanding of the fundamental thermofluids courses - heat transfer; thermodynamics; and fluid mechanics is essential for this project.

32127,Creation of endogenously-tagged cell lines by CRISPR-Cas9 to assess protein localization,Each intracellular compartment in a eukaryotic cell has a unique protein composition. The proteins are generally synthesized on ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported to and through the Golgi. This is accomplished by the formation of transport vesicles at each compartment that must be properly recognized by the correct acceptor compartment. This requires many factors including so-called vesicle tethering factors. Defects in correctly targeting these vesicles have been linked to numerous human disorders. In the early secretory pathway; material is transported between the ER and Golgi and the tethering factor implicated in this process is called TRAPP. In yeast; this complex is composed of 11 subunits that are distributed in 3 complexes. In humans; there are 13 subunits found in 2 distinct complexes. A number of the mammalian-specific proteins; including C11; have been implicated in human health. Understanding the functions of these proteins is an active area of research in my laboratory. In order to better understand the function of these proteins and the entire complex; we must better understand the cellular consequences upon depleting the cells of the proteins. In the past; we have used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate knockouts of non-essential TRAPP genes. However; the gene encoding C11 is essential; thus making a knockout impossible. Although we have obtained fibroblasts from individuals with C11 variants; generating these variants in different types of cells will allow us to better study the consequences of the specific genetic changes. Thus; the applicant will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce patient-identified C11 variants into cells by homolgy-directed repair.,MichaelSacher,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-06,The applicant must have a strong theoretical background in molecular biology and basic cloning procedures including the use of restriction enzymes; ligations and PCR. The candidate should also have a strong theoretical background in biochemical techniques such as cell fractionation; western blotting and immunoprecipitation. The applicant should also have knowledge of growing tissue culture cell lines. Practical skills in any of the aforementioned techniques will be considered a bonus. The applicant must also have a theoretical knowledge of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and the differences between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR).,Biochemistry; Biology; Genetics; Health Studies; Medicine; Medical Sciences; Molecular Biology
32128,Horizontal Gene Transfers in Early-diverging Fungi,Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is a process in which organisms acquire foreign genes from different species. HGT contributes to organismal evolution and has been an important source of genetic diversity. HGT was commonly identified in prokaryotes but rarely reported in eukaryotes. However; our understanding of HGT in eukaryotes is quickly expanding with the production of genomic resources and the development of detection tools. The Kingdom Fungi represent a striking example; especially the ones known as obligate symbionts which interact with various host organisms intimately. Our research group has dedicated to detecting fungus-related HGT elements and has discovered several such cases in early-diverging groups including the mosquito gut-dwelling fungi (doi:10.1093/molbev/msw126); herbivorous mammal rumen fungi (doi:10.1128/mSystems.00247-19); amphibian gastrointestinal fungi (doi:10.1534/g3.120.401516); and photobionts associated fungi (doi:10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.058). This project aims to identify novel HGT using lab newly assembled fungal genomes representing underexplored lineages on the Tree of Life. The student working on this project will help refine lab existing pipelines and analyze the fungal genomes as well as related host data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of identified genes by conducting comparative genomics. A high-impact research report will be accomplished and aimed for publication at the end of the project.,YanWang,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-06,Minimum requirements: Basic programming skills in Linux; Python; and R; effective communication skill Preferred qualification: strong interests in comparative genomics; data visualization; and competencies in writing and public speaking.,
32129,Computational Studies of Modified Nucleic Acid Aptamers and Drugs,Nucleic acids are valuable therapeutics; which can take the form of nucleotides; aptamers or siRNA. The use of nucleic acids permits targeting even currently undruggable since proteins and opens the door for treating a wider array of diseases. Currently; several FDA approved modified nucleic acid therapies exist; with the number in clinical trials rapidly expanding. One challenge in rational drug design is the poor pharmacological properties (immunogenicity; degradation; poor cellular uptake) of unmodified DNA/RNA. Therefore; existing nucleic acid therapies rely on chemical modifications. However; since the number of chemical modifications and positions make the combinatorial space intractably large for most drug designs; experimental studies are restricted to a few modifications chosen based on preliminary hypotheses and extrapolative assumptions. As a result; the structural and stability impact of single and multiple modifications on the nucleic acids is lacking. The proposed work will use molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to systematically consider the impact of single and multiple modification schemes for a range of chemical substituents in different nucleic acid structural motifs. This will provide the much-needed atomic level information required to understand the structure and function of existing and new nucleic acid therapeutics; with the goal to identify novel modifications that will enhance drug performance.,StaceyWetmore,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,Background courses in chemistry; biology; biochemistry and/or math/computer science will provide foundational knowledge for the student to be involved in this project.

32132,Investigation of respiratory neuronal networks involved in the control of respiration,Breathing in mammals is most fragile during sleep; in particular during REM sleep. Data from our laboratory suggest that expiratory activity may be critical in both neonatal and adult period to promote respiratory pacing and provide an additional drive to weak inspiration; in order to prevent breathing irregularities and strengthen inspiratory activity. The objective of the this project is to investigate neuronal structures that control the activity of the brainstem netwrok oscillators that control breathing. By means of a combination of pharmacology; optogenetics and chemogenetics; we will identify neuromodulatory inputs; and manipulate their function in order to determine the role of respiratory neruons in control conditions and in rodent models of sleep disordered breathing. The student will be responsible for the surgical procedures in rodents; acquisition of data; data analysis; and elaboration of the results. The student will aquire expertise in survival surgeries; stereotaxic injection; animal handling; EEG/EMG instrumentation; and optogenetic techniques. She/He will also gain experience on data analysis of EEG and respiratory variables in anesthetized rodents.,SilviaPagliardini,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,- Solid knowledge of general neuroscience; neurophysiology and respiratory physiology - Previous experience with animal handling; and possibly; with surgical procedures in rodents is preferred.,
32133,Cannabinoids effects on sleep and breathing,Although a multitude of undocumented evidence suggests that marijuana (cannabis) promotes relaxation and sleep; there is a lack of systematic scientific studies showing this to be the case. Medically; cannabis may provide fundamental health benefits if it can promote the full spectrum of sleep and also if it has beneficial effects on breathing during sleep (unlike opioids). The purpose of this project is to systematically explore the effects of cannabis principal components on sleep dynamics and breathing in rodents in order to evaluate its potential therapeutic benefits and/or harms. In this way; we can explore how acute and chronic cannabis (or its components) use may impact both sleep and respiratory functions through development and in adulthood. We will use animal models of both sexes to strengthen the evidence base for this targeted approach and build pre-clinical scientific and health related knowledge for future development of a much needed treatment for both sleep and sleep disordered breathing.,SilviaPagliardini,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,background in neuroscience; neuro-physiology; pharmacology and respiratory physiology,Biological Sciences; Biology; Medical Sciences; Medicine; Neuroscience; Molecular Biology; Pharmacology; Physiology; Veterinary Science and Medicine
32134,Sex hormone effects on ventilation,Progesterone (a female sex hormone) has been implicated in the potentiation of breathing during pregnancy and during specific phases of the menstrual cycle in women. Additionally; the reduction in circulating progesterone levels in women is proposed to be a main contributing factor to the increased frequency of sleep disordered breathing following menopause. In this project we will investigate the mechanisms underlying sex-hormone induced ventilatory recovery in a model of central hypoventilation; a condition in which an impaired response to respiratory challenges (high CO2 or low O2 levels of inspired air) occurs because of altered development and/or function of a key area of the brain (the retrotrapezoid nucleus) that senses changes in CO2 and pH levels. We will use a rodent model to generate a impairment in CO2 detection and we will provide a long-term treatment with a synthetic progestinic hormone; (Etonogestrel) that has been previously proposed to induce partial recovery of respiratory function in congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS) patients . We will test recovery of respiratory function in this model and will analyze brain tissue to assess the areas in the brain that are responsible for this recovery and the cellular and molecular changes associated with the hormonal treatment. We will also investigate the function of the gene affected in CCHS (i.e.; PHOX2B): we will reduce expression of the naive protein and we will ectopically express the mutated PHOX2B protein in the retrotrapezoid nucleus. We will assess changes in respiratory function and in gene and protein expression caused by these manipulations. Results from our experiments will explore some important aspects of the mechanism of action of sex hormones that promote chemoreflex recovery; and will contribute to reveal key molecular mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of CCHS and other central hypoventilation syndromes.,SilviaPagliardini,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,knowledge in neuroscience; respiratory physiology; pharmacology,
32135,Recent Advances in Operations Management,Supply chains are a vital part of the Canadian economy; and they consist of an array of industries such as production; distribution; transportation; international trade and retail. Matching supply and demand is challenging due to the scale; complexity and constantly changing nature of a supply chain. Supply chain decisions often require information visibility across functional areas and affect multiple stakeholders. However; supply-side and demand-side decisions are frequently made in silos. The research goal is to improve the overall performance of supply chains. While we are interested in reducing cost on the supply side and increasing revenue on the demand side; we will focus on maximizing profit through the joint control of supply and demand and assessing the benefit of joint control.

32138,RNAi based nanotherpaies for cardiovascular diseases,Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in westernized countries. This burden is caused primarily by atherosclerosis; a systemic disease characterized by chronic inflammation of arterial walls with lumen lipid deposits (plaques). The primary clinical complications caused by atherosclerosis include coronary artery disease (CAD); leading to acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death; cerebrovascular disease leading to stroke. Impaired resolution of inflammation is one of the driving forces of atherosclerosis. Upregulating pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory mediators at the atherosclerotic plaques can attenuate inflammation and repair the resolution. Nanomedicines are ~100 nm particles that can encapsulate single and/ or multiple drugs inside their core and deliver them directly to the diseased sites in a sustained and controlled manner. These particles can also protect drugs from degradation in the blood circulation; lower the dosage range; minimize accumulation in other organs; and decrease the toxic side effects. In this context; we recently developed nanoparticles containing miRNAs delivered intracellularly in vivo to modulate desired pathways. In this project; we will develop novel nanoparticle systems containing pro-resolving; efflux-promoting miRNAs for targeted atherosclerosis therapy. Upon synthesis; NPs will be characterized for their physicochemical properties and study their effects on primary macrophages and mouse models.,SureshGadde,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-06,The proposed project is multidisciplinary and has different aspects. It involves organic chemistry ( biomaterials synthesis); engineering ( nanoparticles fabrications); and molecular biology (PCR; cytotoxicity assays; microscopy studies). So; students with chemistry; engineering; and/or biology background are suitable to work on the project. Irrespective of their background; students will be exposed to all aspects of the project and will have the opportunity to explore and learn other skills and techniques.,Pharmacology; Engg-Biomedical; Chemistry; Medicine
32139,RNAi based combination nanotherapies for TNBC,The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. TNBC patients are prone to recurrence between the first and third years post-treatment; with majority of deaths within the first five years post-therapy. Chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of systemic medical treatment for TNBC; which associates with rapid drug-resistance; enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs); and disease recurrence. Two specific signaling pathways contribute to the enhancement of all CSC subtypes; and they must be co-inhibited to stop tumor regeneration after the treatment. Nanomedicines are ~100 nm size particles that can encapsulate single and/ or multiple drugs inside their core and deliver them directly to the tumors in a sustained and controlled manner. These particles can also protect drugs from the degradation in the blood circulation; lower the dosage range; minimize accumulation in other organs; and decrease the toxic side effects. In this context; we recently developed combination nanomedicine containing chemotherapeutic drug and CSCs inhibitor and studied therapeutic efficacy in animal models. Our combination nanomedicine was able to arrest tumor growth and inhibit CSCs enrichment. But; when compared to small molecule drugs/inhibitors; RNAi-agents (e.g.; siRNA; and miRNAs) can effectively and specifically knockdown target genes/proteins that are involved in drug resistance and tumor metastasis. However; RNAi-agents are highly susceptible to degradation in vivo and need to be protected and delivered to the tumors. In this project; we will develop novel nanoparticles system containing two different siRNAs and paclitaxel; and deliver them to the TNBC tumors for effective treatment. Here siRNAs will target two distinct signaling pathways involved in CSCs enrichment and drug resistance; whereas paclitaxel kills most of the bulk tumor cells. Upon synthesis; NPs will be characterized for their physicochemical properties and study their effects in TNBC cell lines and patient-derived tissue slices.,SureshGadde,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-06,The proposed project is multidisciplinary and has different aspects.

32140,Social network analysis and mining (2024),This Globalink 2024 research project focuses on social network computing and mining. Over the past few years; the rapid growth and the exponential use of social digital media has led to an increase in popularity of social networks and social computing. In general; social networks are structures made of social entities (e.g.; individual users) that are linked by some specific types of inter-dependency relationship such as friendship. The emergence of Web-based communities and hosted services such as social networking sites (e.g.; Facebook; Google+; LinkedIn; Twitter; Weibo) has facilitated collaboration and knowledge sharing between users. Most users of social media have many linkages in terms of friends; connections; and/or followers. Among all these linkages; some of them are more important than others. For instance; some friends of a user may be acquaintances; whereas some others may be close friends that care about him in such a way that they frequently post on his wall; view his updated profile; send him messages; invite him for events; and/or follow his tweets. In this project; students will apply the knowledge and skills they acquired in their undergraduate database courses to build a database for capturing relevant data from a social network. They will then develop a business intelligence solution that applies data mining techniques to social networks so as to help users of the social digital media to discover implicit; previously unknown; and useful knowledge from the social networks.,CarsonLeung,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-06-03,Similar to skill requirements for the Globalink 2013-2023 GRIs (now in top Canadian/US universities like UBC; Waterloo; Columbia; CMU & UIUC or companies like Google); students participating in this 2024 project are expected to have taken some third-year computer science courses (e.g.; database courses) when they started the internship.

32141,Data visualization and visual analytics (2024),This Globalink 2024 research project focuses on visual analytics. Due to advances in technology; high volumes of valuable data are generated at a high velocity in various real-life business applications in modern organizations and society. This leads to huge amounts of data. Embedded in these data are implicit; previously unknown and potentially useful knowledge and interesting information. Consequently; it is important to apply knowledge discovery techniques to mine these data and understand the mining results (e.g.; get an insight about the distribution of the data as well as that of the mined interesting patterns). As "a picture is worth a thousand words"; visual representation of data and the mining results is more comprehensible to users than the traditional long textual list representation. In this project; students will apply the knowledge and skills they acquired in their undergraduate database courses to build a database for capturing relevant data and/or the mining results. They will then develop a visualizer and/or visual analytics solution that applies data mining techniques to data so as to help users to visualize and analyze the raw data; as well as to understand the mining results.,CarsonLeung,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-07-02,Similar to skill requirements for the Globalink 2013-2023 GRIs (now in top Canadian/US universities like UBC; Waterloo; Columbia; CMU & UIUC or companies like Google); students participating in this 2024 project are expected to have taken some third-year computer science courses (e.g.; database courses) when they started the internship.

32142,Big data science and data analytics for useful information (2023),This Globalink 2024 research project focuses on Big data analytics. Due to advances in technology; high volumes of valuable data are generated in various real-life business applications in modern organizations and society. This leads us into the new era of Big Data. In general; Big data are interesting high-velocity; high-value; and/or high-variety data with volumes beyond the ability of commonly-used software to capture; manage; and process within a tolerable elapsed time. Hence; new forms of processing data are needed to enable knowledge discovery. Having developed systematic or quantitative processes to mine and analyze Big data allows us to continuously explore; investigate; and understand the past business performance so as to gain new insight and drive business planning. Over the past few years; several algorithms have been proposed to use the MapReduce/Spark/Flink models (which mine the search space with distributed; parallel; cloud; or fog/edge computing) for different Big data mining and analytics tasks. In this project; students will apply the knowledge and skills they acquired in their undergraduate database courses to build a database for capturing relevant information from Big data. They will then develop a data science; data analytics; and/or business analytics; business intelligence (BI) solution that applies knowledge discovery and data mining techniques to Big data so as to analyze and discover implicit; previously unknown; and useful knowledge (e.g.; frequently co-located events and/or frequent purchased bundles of merchandise items) from Big data.,CarsonLeung,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-07-29,Similar to skill requirements for Globalink 2013-2023 GRIs (now in top Canadian/US universities like UBC; Waterloo; Columbia; CMU & UIUC or companies like Google); students participating in this 2024 project are expected to have taken some third-year computer science courses (e.g.; database courses) when they started the internship.

32143,The Role of Emotion, User Experience and Persuasive Design Play in the Effectiveness of Contact Tracing Apps,Emotions play a central role in human-computer interactions. They influence human perception of and interaction with digital systems. As stated by Don Norman; every digital system has a personality just like humans. In other words; digital systems send an emotional signal; even when this was not the intention of the designer. However; there is little understanding of the “emotional signals” that persuasive technologies aimed at changing behaviors send; and how the evoked emotions can be utilized; together with user characteristics; for personalization. The goal of this research project is to: (1) design and prototype persuasive strategies for contact tracing app on smartphones and smartwatches; (2) investigate the emotions elicited by contact tracing app design; (3) explore the relationship between emotion and user experience design attributes; (4) examine the moderating effect of social-demographic variables such as culture; gender; and age; and (5) investigate how well emotions; user experience attributes; and social-demographic variables predict users’ responsiveness to persuasive strategies implemented in contact tracing apps using machine learning algorithms. Using Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotion; the study will help us to understand the types of emotion elicited by persuasive strategies such as self-monitoring and social learning implemented in contact tracing apps. Moreover; emotions; user experience design attributes; and social-demographic variables have the potential to predict users’ responsiveness to multiple persuasive strategies implemented in behavior change support systems.,PlinioMorita,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-02,• Data cleaning; processing and management skills. • Experience with machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine and random forest. • Understanding of research methodologies (quantitative and qualitative); statistical analysis; and statistical modelling. • Knowledge and skills in mixed-method analysis • Knowledge of data analysis tools such as Python and R. • Critical thinking skills and a natural curiosity to understand data relationships. • Strong oral; interpersonal; communication and writing skills. • Ability to work independently; in a team setting and complete tasks within deadlines.,Design; Computer Science; Physiology; Statistics

However; to acquire such data; they must first obtain informed consent from data subjects; and traditional means of obtaining informed consent are not adequate to collect and manage massive numbers of data subjects distributed over an entire country; province; or city. This work’s objective the development of a dynamic informed consent management platform; guided by a data governance model for public health research; that allows remote collection and management of dynamic informed consent from data subjects. Dynamic informed consent is a digital representation of traditional informed consent forms with enhanced capabilities. The proposed platform allows data subjects to browse available public health studies and decide which they wish to provide consent or not. In parallel; researchers can create study profiles to promote and explain study’s objectives and outcomes. The platform also provides features that facilitate re-consent; which avoid risks to participants and reduce participants withdrawal from studies. Moreover; institutional review boards and other stakeholders can participate in the platform and audit informed consent forms; avoiding harm to data subjects. The anticipated impacts of this work are: (1) Increased people’s engagement in public health research; (2) More data for researchers; (3) Facilitate researchers to obtain and manage dynamic informed consent; (4) Streamlining the process of obtaining re-consent from participants; (5) Inclusion of actors and stakeholders to enact decisions over studies and dynamic informed consent approval; (6) Overtime; improved public health policies and interventions.,PlinioMorita,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-30,• Broad understanding of research methodologies; statistical analysis; visual analytics; and statistical modelling. • Object oriented programming. • Knowledge of one or more of the following: o NodeJs or Javascript. o Angular13+. o CSS and HTML. o NestJS framework. o MySQL database. • Knowledge of blockchain technologies and drive to seek innovation from other ledgers. • Critical thinking skills. • Strong communication and writing skills. • Ability to work within both independently and within team settings to meet strict deadlines.,
32145,The future of AAL: Exploring the continuum between AAL technologies, AAL services, and smart communities,This project is a partnership between the UbiLab and CSA Group to develop new guidelines and checklists and identify the need for new standards to support current and future smart communities seeking to implement active assisted living (AAL) technologies at both the household and community levels. Canada has a growing aging population and a pressing need for non-intrusive; continuous; and reliable health monitoring tools to support aging in place and reduce healthcare costs. However; the Canadian healthcare system is not yet prepared to access and leverage IoT (Internet of Things) data to support clinical decision making outside of hospital settings. With advances in low-cost IoT technology; it is now possible to meaningfully incorporate a variety of sensors into our homes and communities; leading to the implementation of Smart Homes and Smart Communities to support healthy living. This project will provide a framework to guide: (1) new AAL technology manufacturers; (2) developers of new smart communities seeking to ensure that the new developments are compatible and prepared to receive AAL and IoT sensors; (3) communities seeking to leverage data generated by AAL and IoT sensors into fully integrated community health services (e.g.; pharmacies; allied health professionals; community clinics; etc.),PlinioMorita,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-02,- Knowledge and understanding of the Canadian healthcare system and the challenges of data use in this context - Broad understanding of qualitative research methodologies - Strong communication abilities; both written and verbal - Experience with writing research briefs and academic papers an asset - Experience in research or healthcare for older adults an asset,
32146,Supporting Healthy Aging using Smart Home Technology – A Remote Monitoring Platform,Assisted-living for seniors lowers their quality of life and places financial strain on families and our healthcare system. Successful aging in place hinges on providing environments and resources that enable people to be as independent; secure; and healthy as possible. Rapid advances in technology coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) have resulted in an amazing opportunities for the development of active assisted living (AAL) systems for monitoring and supporting healthy living. AAL technologies have the potential to monitor indoor behaviours; quantify cognitive and physical deterioration; and to identify early warnings for interventions. The goal of this research project is to develop a smart device platform to monitor in-home health behaviours to support independent living by older adults. In this project; we propose the development of an ecosystem to aggregate data from existing smart home technologies coupled with machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in everyday behaviours. The technology should (1) recognizing daily living activity and modelling behavior patterns; (2) detecting and analyzing abnormal activity data to support risk factor surveillance; (3) displaying the outcome through a user-friendly interface A remote monitoring platform would notify caregivers or family members when an expected behaviour is not observed; or a sensor reading is out of normal bounds. This project will enable caregivers and care providers to use smart home sensor data to monitor family members living independently. Through the development of an AAL software layer and integration of smart device monitoring of autonomous behaviours; this project will result in the production of a low-cost modular solution to support independent living for older adults.

32147,Prediction of the onset of dementia and enabling remote monitoring using Ecobee's smart thermostat technology,Remote monitoring of individuals living independently is a challenging endeavor. Most remote monitoring platforms are expensive; require specific sensors to be installed in one’s home; and violates privacy. “ecobee” is a Canadian manufacturer of smart thermostats that leverages wireless sensors (temperature; presence; movement) to adjust the temperature in the house according to room occupancy and consequently save energy. Currently; non-standardized data sharing and non-standardized placement of sensors is the main challenge to the widespread use of ecobee technology in health and wellness. The partnership between University of Waterloo and ecobee will explore the use of sensor data to identify patterns in user behavior; social isolation; and mobility limitations; expanding the use of ecobee into the health and wellness domain. Leveraging recent developments in machine learning; this project will explore how a system can be trained by combining personal level data (steps; vitals; activity; etc.) with IoT sensory data (presence in the rooms). The team at the Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab (www.uwaterloo.ca/ubilab) at the University of Waterloo are in the process of designing and conducting several experiments to evaluate the application of IoT data on remote patient monitoring. A large range of initiatives; as real-world data studies; controlled lab experiments; and data mining through deep-learning; are being used in this project to enable our research team to leverage existing ecobee sensor data for health applications. We are looking for engaged; innovative individuals to help us advance the IoT for heath data science field; enabling our research team to collect; mine; and integrate data from a large range of consumer-level technologies.

32148,Mobile Health Surveillance Platform,Public health surveillance data are the most important source of information to support decision making by public health agencies. One of the main sources of data are surveys; which traditionally have limitations related to self-reported data such as social/recall bias; loss due to follow-up; delays between collection and reporting; and costs/logistics. An alternative is the use of smart technologies as additional survey tools; as they provide zero-effort monitoring of diverse health variables (e.g.; physical activity; sleep). This project’s objective is to create a Mobile Health Surveillance platform that will collect and store health data from devices connected to Apple Health; one of the most comprehensive mobile health repositories. The platform will (i) improve social bias by providing a secure space for participants to report information; (ii) diminish recall bias; as information will be collected continuously; (iii) minimize follow-up losses; as the platform will leverage data already being collected by Canadians; (iv) minimize delays for data report with real-time analytics; (v) improve costs/logistics; as deploying an app to a large number of people is simple and cost-effective. To validate the platform; we will conduct a pilot study to predict stress in a population using mobile health data and Machine Learning algorithms. This project takes the initial steps to address limitations in traditional public health surveillance methods cancer by providing the tool and infrastructure required to collect; process and analyze mobile health data. Ultimately; this work will provide public health agencies in Canada with more accurate data to improve the health of communities and populations. We are looking for engaged; innovative individuals to help us advance the Mobile Health Surveillance platform; contributing to the development of the mobile application; its interface; and predicting algorithms (data science).

32149,Air Pollution Monitoring for Public Health Intervention,Air pollution is a global public health concern. It is responsible for a cascade of adverse health outcomes. However; quantifying the results and impacts of air pollution is difficult. The advancement of IoT and big data technologies can now allow public health officials and researchers to monitor air pollution levels and take appropriate and rapid actions to mitigate the harms. We propose the development of an agnostic ecosystem that collects big data and from various sensors; analyzes and predicts harm using AI and deep learning. This project aims to create a real-time; crowdsourced; IoT-based air quality monitoring ecosystem using IoT sensors. In doing so; these data can then be used by the national public health agency to expedite the necessary steps to mitigate the adverse impacts of air pollution. The Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab (UbiLab) has partnered with UNICEF Mongolia to create a real-time; crowdsourced; IoT-based air quality monitoring ecosystem using IoT sensors (e.g. AirVisuals; Kaitera; Plume Labs; and other sensors) that are either currently available in the community (e.g. Ulaanbaatar already has 300+ of these sensors installed in the city; owned by residents in the community). UNICEF officials have also deployed additional IoT air quality monitoring sensors across Ulaanbaatar in collaboration with the Mongolian national public health agency; focusing on increasing the monitoring in schools; kindergartens; community clinics; and hospitals. The specific research question that we are looking to address for this project is if real-time data monitoring combined with AI allows public health officials to monitor the harms of air pollution. The specific outcomes we are looking to address is a reduction of hospitalizations to mothers and children in the UB district.,PlinioMorita,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-02,• Experience with machine learning and/or deep learning is considered an asset but not necessary. • Broad understanding of research methodologies; statistical analysis; visual analytics; and statistical modelling. • Competent with data management (cleaning; pattern recognition; analysis of the structured data). • Knowledge of data analysis tools is considered an asset but not necessary. • Critical thinking skills and a natural curiosity to understand data relationships. • Strong communication and writing skills. • Ability to work within both independently and within team settings to meet strict deadlines.,Engg-Software; Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Design; Mathematics; Statistics; Information Studies; Management Information Systems
32150,Rôle des microvésicules d'origine plaquettaires dans la modulation de cellules immunitaires,Platelets are small anucleated cells (about 3-5 µm) in discoid shape that patrol the vascular supply to prevent blood loss. Although these cells are better appreciated for their roles in blood clotting; more and more studies show that these cells are active participants in several types of inflammatory diseases; including PAR. Activation of platelets in response to various stimuli such as collagen; thrombin or immune complexes results in the generation of 3 sub-populations of microparticles (MPs). These subpopulations of platelet MPs are abundantly present in the synovial fluid once they have arrived in the synovial fluid; these MPs can secrete a panoply of inflammatory mediators but can also be internalized by the neutrophils present in the fluid. However; the consequences of the local generation of these inflammatory mediators derived from platelet MPs and the internalization of these in neutrophils remain very little known to date. Therefore; this project aims to better understand the role of MPs in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory phases.,LucBoudreau,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Training in immunology; biochemistry or chemistry would be a skill required for this project.

32152,Biomaterials for optimized building resources use,The research project will focus on the exploration and development of bio-based materials. During the first stage students will learn about several biomaterial growing techniques (i.e. mycelium; bacterial based cellulose) and will familiarize themselves with the lab experimentation protocols. Students will study: biomaterials’ growing substrates (e.g. sawdust; fabric; agricultural waste; etc.); integration of biomaterials into standard materials (e.g. aerated concrete; spray foams; expanded clay; bio-waste); form-finding processes (performance as a function of morphological studies); construction processes (3D printing; projection over surface; rigid panels). This first stage will take place at the wet lab. In a second stage; similar experiments will be conducted with local organisms and the aim will be to develop novel bio-materials adapted to the North. Thirdly; samples of bio-based materials will be regularly tested for their mechanical properties; biotic and abiotic degradation; hygrothermal properties; dimensional stability and resistance to fire. Successful bio-based materials will be used during the fourth stage to build prototypes of building units at CAST (Centre for Architectural Structures and Technology) at the University of Manitoba and; potentially deployed at selected northern communities for further performance evaluation.,MercedesGarcia Holguera,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-05,Students from architecture; engineering and biology fields are welcomed to apply.

32153,Define the role of ZNF in the development of cancer - in vitro and in vivo.,Cancer is the primary cause of death in Canada. It is estimated that about 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetimes and 1 in 4 will die of the disease. Despite advances in early detection and standard treatment; many cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a poor prognosis. Members of the RAS family of small GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancers. Oncogenic mutations have been found in all three members of the RAS gene family; Despite its prominent status as a cancer drug target; therapeutics aimed at blocking RAS have proven challenging thus far. Identifying proteins downstream of RAS that could be targeted to specifically harm cancer cells represents a strategy that could be used to circumvent the challenges linked to the direct inhibition of RAS. Over the last years we have identified an uncharacterized Zinc-finger protein (ZNF) as a new target of RAS. The primary objective of this project is to define the relation between ZNF and cancer development in vivo. The specific aims of our projet are to i) define the physiological impact of ZNF768 overexpression; ii) define whether ZNF affects cancer initiation and development and iii) Identify the transcriptional signature of tumours with elevated ZNF. These objectives are part of a broad research program whose long-term goal is to characterize new molecular mechanisms contributing to human cancer.,MathieuLaplante,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,I am looking for a student that has a good knowledge of the cell.

32154,Robot dynamics identification,This research project is designed to lead to the improvement of one of the most important performance criteria for collaborative robotic arms: collision detection and detection of physical interaction with the outside world. This criterion is important both for classical automation applications and for collaborative applications where a robot is required to physically interact with a person. In particular; the project will explore and evaluate methods for identifying the dynamic model of a manipulator robot. The main challenge of this objective is that existing model identification methods often focus only on the identification of inertial and kinematic parameters. This is necessary and may be sufficient for some classical applications. However; for collaborative applications; the identification of inertial properties is not sufficient to achieve a high level of transparency and responsiveness. Initial efforts will focus on identifying the sources of uncertainty and delay in the model. Then; the optimization problem that defines the identification problem will be clearly defined and optimization strategies will be developed. Then; trajectories increasing the observability of the different kinematic and dynamic parameters to be identified will be designed. Finally; a thorough experimental validation will be conducted. The robot used is a collaborative robot intended for the research of safe human-robot interaction. It is equipped with torque sensors at each joint that allows knowing the torque exerted by each motor. In addition; this robot allows the control from a computer at a frequency of 1kHz.,AndreGallant,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Candidates should be in the final years of an undergraduate in mechanical; electrical; or mechatronics engineering or an equivalent program.

32155,High speed GPU computation for robotics,This research project is designed to lead to the improvement of one of the most important performance criteria for collaborative robotic arms: task execution speed. This criterion is important both for classical automation applications and for collaborative applications where a robot is required to physically interact with a person. This project aims at allowing the computation of a trajectory to be performed as quickly as possible (reduction of the computation time). The motion optimization problem can be divided into two categories: geometric path following and path planning without a prescribed path. While optimizing a trajectory by following a known path can be done efficiently; even in real time; optimizing a trajectory without a prescribed path remains a great challenge. The Dynamium research laboratory at the Université de Moncton is developing motion optimization algorithms; but computation time is an important consideration for the efficient deployment of such methods. To handle dynamic events during operation (e.g.; collision avoidance and task planning using computer vision); robotic manipulators must be able to modify their motion in near real-time. This project will explore the possibility of exploiting computation on graphics cards (GPU) to drastically reduce the computation time for trajectory optimization.,AndreGallant,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Candidates must be students in the final stages of an undergraduate program in mechanical; electrical; mechatronics; software; computer engineering or an equivalent program.

Knowledge of numerical optimization techniques will be considered an asset.,
32156,Coastal Climate Change Resilience - British Columbia,Climate models forecast further increases in temperature; more extreme weather events and a rise in sea-level; and as a result coastal communities continue to be at risk. This research seeks to document climate related threats; and shed light on the motivations; extent (embedded v. appendage); and actions (reactionary v. anticipatory) around policy and planning for climate adaptation in coastal communities; in order to better understand their preparedness for climate variability.  The study focuses on communities that have an adaptation agenda in some form; whether sophisticated or modest; or just in the works (even the just thinking about it stage). This study will provide insight into community preparedness for climate variability and contribute to the emerging literature on resilience theory. Further by exploring the decision dynamics around community adaptation plan/ policy conception and action implementation; this research will shed light on the role key actors (e.g. planners; engineers; sustainability managers etc.) play and the skills/ expertise they harness in order to help their community become resilient to an increasingly variable climate. In order to provide comparison; case study cities/ communities will be selected in order to represent a range in population and spatial size; risk to climate variability; and sophistication of adaptive action. Each location will include semi-structured interviews with key actors from the community. A range of informants will be investigated; including managers that can speak to governance around plan conception/ development; planners that can address on-the-ground implementation (e.g. transportation; land-use; utilities; emergency management); as well as key officials (councillor; mayor). Analysis of strategic planning documents will also be included; eg. Official Community Plans; sustainability/ climate change strategies.,S.

32157,BioSoil North,Limited fertility and low carbon content are the greatest restraints for agricultural production on boreal soils in northern Canada. As a consequence; landowners use diverse practices to help build soil carbon and fertility; typically drawing on locally available organic wastes. However; these local practices are not verified or calibrated. Additionally; their utility; cost effectiveness and success has not been quantified. The aim of this project is to develop a structured approach to understand the impact of organic wastes on improving soil carbon sequestration and nutrient availability while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from differently managed agricultural fields; including different soil management approaches and cropping systems; in selected boreal regions will help elucidate the relationship between agricultural productivity and soil carbon within the context of the potential of greenhouse gas emissions. This research will be undertaken on working farms in the boreal region of Labrador. The Intern will receive training in carbon and greenhouse gas sciences; soil science and agriculture. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the Memorial University of Newfoundland,MarenOelbermann,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-03,The MITACS Intern should be comfortable working in a northern environment that is more remote (not a metropolitan area). The Intern will have all amenities necessary for a comfortable living and they will be working with a team of graduate students and post-doctoral fellow on this project. The Intern will not be alone. The Intern should be comfortable with field work including the removal and processing of soil samples; measuring greenhouse gases.

32158,Prevention of Falls in Older Adults Through Movements,When someone falls; there are many consequences for the person and the health system. Almost 100;000 people in Canada are admitted to the hospital annually because of a fall! The best way to reduce the number of fall injuries is to exercise regularly. As a result; many communities offer exercise programs for older adults to help reduce falls. However; according to the latest Canadian report; fewer than one in ten fall prevention exercise programs provide the best program possible; meaning that programs should be offered all year long; a least three hours per week; and focus on balance activities. In addition; some Canadians do not have such a program in their region. Our team includes local; provincial; and national partners; in addition to researchers and students from Canada and Northern Ireland. They have all collaborated to plan the Attract; Adapt; IMplement and Sustain (AAIMS) project to understand how to: 1- attract people who currently do not participate in fall prevention exercise programs; 2- adapt the programs currently offered that do not meet the recommendations; 3- offer a program that follows recommendations if needed; 4- keep offering a program in community settings. The exercise program will be offered in person; online; or in a combination of the two. We will collect information by interviewing key people over the course of the project and will test how many people registered for the program; if they come with different characteristics; if there are signs that programs will last; and if people who were doing the program fall fewer times compared to the general public. This program will help us understand how to better spread a program that works in many different places while reducing participant falls.,DanielleBouchard,New Brunswick,University of New Brunswick,English,2024-05-06,The student must have a genuine interest in exercise science related to health research.

32159,Investigating the burden of recreational water illness in Canada,Swimming and other water activities at public beaches are increasingly popular leisure activities among Canadians. However; these activities can lead to increased risks of acquiring acute gastrointestinal illness and respiratory; skin; ear; and eye infections among beachgoers. These illnesses have a significant health and economic burden on society; with young children having much higher rates of illness than other agegroups. Currently; baseline data are lacking on the risk of recreational water illness in Canada; and beachgoers may lack awareness and understanding of these risks and how to prevent them. Our research team is currently conducting a series of studies investigating the burden of recreational water illness in Canada and approaches to improve recreational water surveillance and management. Examples of ongoing activities that the research assistant could be involved in include: a beach cohort study that interviews beachgoers at beaches in Canada to determine their beach water activities and risk of becoming after visiting the beach; surveillance for cyanobacterial blooms at targeted beach sites and surveys of recreational water users about illness risks; and investigation of beachgoer risk perceptions and behaviours toward recreational water quality and beach water illness risks.

32160,Applications of quantum algorithms and computers to the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives,One critical task in the use of quantum computers for pricing financial options is the loading of the distribution (univariate or multivariate) of prices for the security(ies) underlying the financial options in the state space of n qubits. If done sequentially; 2^n operations are required; so this task alone may hinder the efficiency of the quantum algorithm designed for option pricing. One possible way to address this is to relax the requirement of an exact loading of the distribution and only perform an approximate one. Among these approximate algorithms; quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs) have had a fair deal of success. A qGAN is composed of a set of two neural networks: a generator; which is hosted on a quantum computer; and a discriminator; which is usually a (classical) neural network. We start with a dataset from the distribution we want to load or with an empirical dataset we want to model. The generator is trained to produce samples with the distribution of the dataset and the discriminator is trained to distinguish the samples from the dataset from those coming from the generator. We alternate the training of each object. The resulting optimization process is not stationary and risks getting stuck without converging to a suitable solution. Our goal in this project is to explore the different choices of initial state to feed the generator; the various possible forms (or ansatze) for the generator and the different cost functions to optimize. These are just a few examples of the typical cluster of fine tuning problems that come with empirical investigations. We seek to obtain a robust algorithm that will allow for the efficient loading of several distributions of interest for financial purposes.,AlainBélanger,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,A strong mathematical background is required; as well as some proficiency in computer programming (e.g. Python; MATLAB; R or C).

32161,Design and Development of a Fast Motor Controller Board for Haptic Interaction,A stable haptic interaction with virtual environment or in teleoperation depends on the sampling frequency of the computer interface or the data acquisition board. On the other hand; to control the force or torque applied by electric motors (brushed DC motor for example); the controller should be able to control the current of the motor precisely. Fast data acquisition boards in market are very expensive and usually do not provide enough analog input/output channels with good resolution. The motor driver boards in the market do not provide precise current control. To solve these two problems; this project aims at design and development of a motor controller board including the USB communication; analog to digital and digital to analog converters; and current amplifier. The controller should have a microprocessor/microcontroller unit for controlling all other units.

32166,Sensorized Outfit for Rehabilitation,Posture monitoring is of importance in rehabilitation training to enhance training effectiveness. We have developed a set of wired and wireless sensory systems (Data-RX™) that is able to measure the orientations of the object to which the sensor is attached. In this project; we will employ multiple sensors attached to 16 points of a human body; to measure and detect the posture of the human while requested to perform a specific task. The kinematic equations of the body should be derived; and then an optimal location for each sensor should be defined in order to prototype a sensorized rehabilitation outfit (SRO) to record posture during the performance of a task. The SRO consists of accelerometers in various positions with textile integration; controlled by an RX-UI™ processor; including roll; pitch and yaw (Euler) angles; linear accelerations (3 DOFs); angular accelerations (3 DOFs); angular velocity (3 DOFs); magnetic field (3 DOFs); jerk components (3 DOFs); several key performance indicators (KPIs). The SRO will record; analyze; and real-time plot data from a variety of sensor units. The SRO will include our custom RX-UI™ software; compatible with Windows; macOS; and Linux. RX-UI™ will allow the user to (i) record and store sensor data from the connected DataRX™ sensor reader for kinematic analysis of a human’s body. The user will be able to export recorded data to standard formats such as an Excel Workbook or comma-separated values (CSV) file. We aim to design SRO with its software development kit (SDK). The SDK will be developed in .NET Standard. The SDK easily connects SRO to the desired development environment; such as the Unity™ game development engine. For this project; we need 3 students; one in mechanical engineering; one in electrical engineering; and one in computer engineering or computer science.,KouroshZareinia,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-15,For this project; we need 3 students; one in mechanical engineering; one in electrical engineering; and one in computer engineering or computer science for programming.,
32167,Persuasive and Behaviour Change Systems,The design of interactive systems for behaviour change has emerged as a growing new area of research in Human-Computer Interaction within Applied Computer Science. Avoiding risky behaviours; living a healthy lifestyle; promoting safety and security-conscious behaviours; acting to preserve the environment and reduce climate change can all benefit from Persuasive Technologies (PTs). PTs are interactive systems designed to motivate desirable behaviour change. Personalizing persuasive technologies is the act of adapting PT contents and functionalities to be appropriate for the target users and increase their relevance; motivational appeal; and hence their overall effectiveness at promoting desirable behaviour change. Despite this growing interest and investments into PTs design; current PTs suffer a major limitation: They are not personalized to be appropriate for the target user(s). Research has shown that personalizing PTs will increase their efficacy at motivating the desired behaviour change and that not personalizing PTs could be detrimental to behaviour change. However; there is little knowledge on how PTs can be personalized. To solve this problem; we propose a user-centered approach for personalizing PTs to motivate behaviour change. In this project; we are generally interested in applying the user-centered and participatory design approach (which involves the target users at every stage of the system design process) to design and evaluate PTs such as Games; Mobile; Social Media and Web Applications; and Virtual Reality that are personalized to be appropriate for the target. We are mostly interested in designing these systems to solve problems that are of global importance especially in the area of health and wellness (e.g; promoting a healthy lifestyle; physical activity; healthy eating; smoking cessation) and safety and security (e.g.; avoiding risky driving behaviour). Problem domains such as energy conservation and climate change are also of interest.

32168,Polymerizing a Green Future for Electronics: Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Semiconducting Polymers for Sustainable Soft Electronics,The possibility of using the human body as a platform for electronics capable of sensing a multitude of parameters and enhancing biological functionalities has been a constant focus of mankind’s imagination from the dawn of the industrial revolution. Directly inspired by biological tissues; next generation electronics have to be capable of being molded in different shapes and forms and; more importantly; being utilized directly on (or inside) the human body to enhance our connectivity to the environment and; ultimately; develop new applications such as personalized healthcare. Among others; π-conjugated polymers; a class of semiconducting materials; possess most of the properties required to enable the fabrication of this next generation bio-inspired electronics. Despite important advantages; these materials are still suboptimal for the fabrication of bio-integrated devices; mainly due to a competition between electronic and mechanical properties. Moreover; conjugated polymers are typically prepared from non-renewable precursors and processed in harmful organic solvents; which can be detrimental for their use in conjunction with biological environments. Therefore; new solutions are required to generate sustainable new π-conjugated materials with enhanced mechanical compliance and with novel properties that can facilitate their integration to the human body. The proposed research project is based on a multidisciplinary approach interlacing polymer; organic; and supramolecular chemistry for the development of new materials to be used for the fabrication of softer and deformable organic electronics with a reduced environmental footpring. This will be realized through the utilization of supramolecular chemistry and non-covalent interactions. In addition to the design and synthesis of the materials; the project will use a multitude of analytical techniques to fully characterize the materials; both mechanically and electronically. Moreover; electronic devices (thin film transistor) will also be fabricated with the new materials; towards new sensors and devices.,SimonRondeau-Gagné,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-20,Research interests in polymer chemistry and materials science are desirable. By being involved in this project; the students will have the opportunity to develop their skills in synthesis and polymerization methodologies. Moreover; a complete characterization of the materials will be performed; which will allow for the students to learn various instrumental techniques. Finally; most of the materials will be processed in thin films allowing for the student to acquire skills in polymer processing and engineering. No experience is required: only motivation!

32171,Mobile App for Patients Health Monitoring,Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an important public health problem associated with a considerable amount of morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that 5 – 10% of all hospital admissions are attributed to ADR. In Europe; about 197;000 persons die annually from the ADR-related problem. ADRs are the fourth to sixth largest cause of death in the United States. Despite being a leading cause of death; ADRs are largely preventable. The current pharmacovigilance practice relies mainly on spontaneous reporting systems and pharmacoepdemiological studies for detection and reporting of ADRs. However; these monitoring strategies do not capture all the ADR events occurring both in the hospital setting and in the general population. Therefore; additional strategies are needed to improve the monitoring and reporting of ADRs. Underreporting of ADRs is a major challenge for global pharmacovigilance and has a huge impact on the safety of medicines in public health. Although modern techniques are been developed including a web-based system; the existing monitoring strategies are inadequate and need to be integrated with fast-growing technologies. In this project; we will design a mobile app for monitoring potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) using interactive mobile applications or/and web application. Using this app; both patients and their caregivers (doctors; nurses; etc.) will monitor the patient's responses to new medications. Patients will be able to track and record their reactions to various medications; observed changes. On the other hand; doctors and nurses can analyze these patients tracked data to predict possible adverse reactions to medications and take appropriate actions to prevent further damages.,RITAORJI,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-15,The student needs to have some design skills; be interested in programming or learning programming.

32175,Artificial intelligence and human rights,With the speed of recent technological developments; it has become difficult to anticipate the next generation of artificial intelligence innovations with which human will live. In recent years; artificial intelligence softwares have increasingly appeared across the globe. Due to this rapid development; international law has not always been able to keep pace with these new types of technologies. The appearance of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations has raised plenty of legal and ethical dilemmas. Not only it directly affects fundamental human rights; such as the right to equality and privacy; AI can also conflict with some basic principles of humanity; such as freedom of thought. Lastly; the emergence of AI raises questions as to how it can benefit humans and increase their enjoyment of human rights. This project proposes to study the possible impacts of artificial intelligence on human rights from the point of view of international law. In addition to addressing the interactions between technological innovations and human rights in general; providing an introduction to some features of artificial intelligence and offering an overview of international debates on these topics; the project seeks to address artificial intelligence and legal; political and ethical questions that this phenomenon raises for the protection of human rights. Among other topics the project can cover artificial intelligence; the right to equality and discrimination; the protection of privacy; freedom of thought international humanitarian law; the right to life and integrity; responsibility and the obligation to accountability; the right to justice; human mobility and migration; as well as economic issues and social rights.,BernardDuhaime,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,Either English or French,2024-06-03,Law; international law; human rights law; technologies and the law; legal research,
32176,Human stem cell models to study axon regeneration,Central nervous system (CNS) injuries result in permanent functional loss due to the inherent inability of adult CNS neurons to regenerate axons and re-establish connections. There are currently no effective treatments; thus the development of new therapeutic strategies to address the regenerative failure in the mature CNS and improve the quality of life for patients is essential. Cellular responses to the traumatic injury serve to limit the extent of damage in the CNS; but these responses create an inhibitory environment that prevents neurons from surviving and regenerating. Our investigations into mechanisms that regulate axon outgrowth recently uncovered two novel and unique ways to promote axonal regeneration. In this project; the student will work with senior lab members to study the mechanisms whereby these pathways control axon regeneration in the human context. Specifically; human stem cell derived neuronal lineages (cortical; motor neuron) and cerebral organoids will be employed. This work will enhance our understanding of nervous system development and axon regeneration and in the long term should provide insights that could impact therapeutic strategies for the treatment of injuries of the central nervous system.,LilianaAttisano,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-13,The student should have taken courses in molecular biology.

32177,Digital soil science: Use of machine learning algorithms for soil characterization,Soil properties vary from location to location. Therefore; we need to measure a large number of soil samples in order to characterize the soil properly. However; most of the soil properties are time-consuming; laborious; and expensive to measure which calls for new methods to overcome the issues. With the advancement of imaging techniques and the development of computing powers; computer vision-based image analysis techniques show promise to characterize soil properties. Developing reliable and robust image analysis algorithms can provide a large number of opportunities to characterize soil quickly and cheaply and transform traditional soil science into digital soil science. Soil texture (percent sand silt and clay fractions in soil) is an important factor in the decision-making of a large number of agricultural management operations; civil engineering applications; and other industries. Similarly; soil organic matter is considered the backbone of soil health and quality. This project aims to develop a reliable and robust computer vision algorithm to characterize soil texture and organic matter. In general; soil texture and organic matter are affected by the presence of soil moisture. Previously some attempts have been made to characterize soil texture and soil organic matter using computer vision techniques. However; the challenge lies in the effectiveness of those algorithms as the image quality is often affected by soil moisture. A new algorithm is to be developed or organized by combining several old algorithms to characterize soil properties. Examining the effect of soil moisture on the image quality and the performance of the newly developed algorithms on those images would provide a new way to characterize soil properties specifically soil texture and soil organic matter.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A background in computer programming and image processing is required with desirable knowledge on image collection or photography using different types of cameras; taking photographs of soil samples; collecting and processing soil samples in the laboratory and in the field; and setting up laboratory conditions to take images.

32179,Converting batch pharmaceutical syntheses into continuous flow mode,In the pharmaceutical industry; both small and large scale synthesis of drugs is carried out primarily by batch methods. This creates substantial challenges upon converting from small scale; where batch reactors can be efficient and simple; to large scale where mass and heat transfer can become prohibitive. The Newman group is engaged in facilitating the transition of batch processing into continuous flow mode. In this project; specific chemical reactions will be targeted where substantial benefits can be obtained upon converting a batch system into continuous flow. A continuous reactor will be designed and the chemical reaction will be optimized to overcome challenges associated with traditional reactors and enable efficient scale-up.

These projects are part of a larger scale multi-facetted research program spanning many years; using Carbone boréal’s 11 research plantations (for more than one million planted and verified trees) mostly located in the boreal forest North of the Lac-St-Jean for the regular plantations and around the lake (South-East) for the agricultural ones. Carbone boréal’s plantations are established in Québec’s natural open woodlands which do not self-regenerate. Research forests are created in collaboration with Quebec’s Ministère des ressources naturelles et des forêts; in respect of forest ecosystems and biodiversity. They bear the experimental forest statute; protecting them from exploitation. Plantations on agricultural land are performed in wastelands and/or unexploitable land (slopes; edges; etc.); as determined with Quebec's Ministère de l'Agriculture; des Pêcheries et de l'Alimentation and the farmers/owners.

32182,Single-particle tracking microscopy to understand the physical organization of bacterial cell shape,Bacteria are surrounded by a rigid shell; the peptidoglycan cell wall; a single covalently linked macromolecule that gives the cell its shape and size. For cells to grow and change cell shape; dedicated proteins/enzymes need to cut covalent bonds in the cell wall and insert new cell-wall material. The question we address in this project: Can we see how a particular enzyme known to cut the cell wall contributes to the enlargement of the cell wall. To study this question we have labeled individual proteins with fluorescent labels; and we can follow their motion using single-particle tracking (SPT) in laser-based TIRF microscopy. We hypothesize that proteins transition between different states of motion: diffusive; immobile; or persistently moving. These different motion types can give us indirect information about where the molecules are active; how long they are bound to their substrate or to other enzymes; whether binding/unbinding are cooperative or require the presence of partners. However; the analysis of different motion states is complicated by noise. To interpret noisy single-particle tracks; we recently developed a statistical analysis pipeline (github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack). In this project the student will use SPT and image analysis to characterize the motion of a particular fluorescently labeled enzyme and learn if and how it contributes to cell growth.,Svenvan Teeffelen,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to have a strong quantitative background in physics; engineering; or a related discipline; with experience in coding (preferably python and matlab).

A major goal of our lab is to understand how cells coordinate growth of cell shape with growth of biomass to maintain a high degree of intracellular macromolecular crowding; one of the key functions of cell-envelope growth. In this project the student will perturb different processes of biomass growth (metabolism) and envelope growth (e.g.; membrane biosynthesis) while measuring biomass and shape growth. Depending on the experience in either biology; physics; or engineering; the project will either involve the construction and investigation of mutants or the modulation of the microscope.,Svenvan Teeffelen,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,This project is open to students from backgrounds in both biology or quantitative sciences such as physics and bioengineering.

32184,Parallel and Scalable Design Automation Tools for High-Speed VLSI Circuits,Massive evolution that is currently taking place in the global high-technology industry has made the electronics; computing and communications products to be part of day-to-day life and highly pervasive. From the user’s end; there is an enormous demand for faster and converging multi-function designs. This is mandating the products with higher-operating speeds as well as high-density designs. At the same time; the need for higher capacity and bandwidth in wire-line communication networks drives the signal speed to multi-gigabits per second and beyond. At such high data rates; high frequency effects in electronic packages and systems such as delay; attenuation; reflection; and crosstalk become the dominant factors limiting the overall performance of microelectronic systems. In addition; with the fast rising demand for multi-function capabilities; modern designs are becoming highly complex. This is because the desire for multifunction and miniature products warrants mixed-domain integration of heterogeneous circuit components such as digital; analog; RF; optical and micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) devices. As a result; advanced accurate simulation and design methodologies become increasingly indispensable in achieving the next generation communication and computing products. However; the current design tools do not handle adequately the new emerging challenges of high-speed circuits; interconnects and mixed-domain problems. Among the major challenges faced while modeling; simulating and optimizing such design environments are the large-scale nature of the resulting equations (which tend to span in the order of millions of unknowns) as well as the mixed frequency/time difficulties arising due to the diverse nature of the associated components. However; one of the main difficulties with most of these techniques is that; they are single processor based sequential algorithms and hence can’t adequately handle the computational complexity of today’s large-scale mixed-domain designs.

In this context; the Chair realizes projects on the valorization of industrial residues from the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region through fertilization in agriculture and silviculture to open the perspectives for the industries and create new management opportunities. The projects in industrial ecology are on two components. The first component on fertilization in nordic agriculture aims to 1) develop the valorization of fertilizing industrial by-products and 2) calculate the GHG emission budget from this valorization. The second component on fertilization in silviculture aims to determine the effects of land application of fertilizing industrial by-products on: 1) stand productivity; 2) soil quality; 3) content in compounds with added value; 4) the financial profitability of an intervention and 5) the GHG emission budget from this practice to evaluate its contribution to the mitigate climate change.,PatrickFaubert,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-13,-Following a study program in biology; environment; chemistry; physic or any other relevant programs related to the field -Clear interest for industrial ecology; issues related to climate change and greenhouse gas management -Capacity to integrate a multidisciplinary research group at the Chair on eco-advising -Capacity to do physical and meticulous work on the field and in laboratory,

32187,Microcirculation,You'll get to work with some really smart graduate students on some cool projects. One project is all about how changes in the shape; rigidity; or age of red blood cells affect how they move through tiny blood vessels. We want to understand how these changes impact our health. Another project is focused on how red blood cells interact with each other and affect how thick or thin the blood is in specific areas. This is important because it can impact how well oxygen and nutrients are delivered throughout the organs. And finally; we're exploring how red blood cells flow through different types of networks in the body. This kind of research can help us understand how blood moves through our bodies and how we can design better treatments for diseases that affect circulation.,MarianneFenech,Ontario,University of Ottawa,Either English or French,2024-05-01,We're seeking someone who knows about fluid mechanics and has basic programming knowledge ( e.g MATLAB).

32188,Computational Optimal Modelling of Mathematical Models for Infectious Diseases,Infectious disease outbreak and wide spread are always one of the most challenging public health crisis faced by all levels of governments and international organizations. The 2020 global pandemic of COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads everywhere; which caused the whole global stops to combat the virus. Scientists and researchers worldwide are working hard to find best solutions to reduce quick spread and personal mortality. How to control and mitigate the impact of disease caused on affected country’s public health and economic growth is a complicated question entangled with many factors. Mathematical modelling is widely used recently to describe the broad-scale spread of infectious diseases; and is very useful to provide best designed control measures specific to different diseases. From acute disease such as influenza to chronic infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HIV; the real challenge lies in several aspects of the mathematical modelling process. Various transmission patterns; different incubation periods and transmission periods; variable age structure for different patient groups will lead to complex structured mathematical models. Building detailed mathematical models specific to one disease is an enjoyable process to refresh knowledge from public health/epidemiology; mathematical modelling; numerical simulation; data analysis; etc. Mathematical analysis is essential to investigate the disease dynamics while the complete analysis is always challenging. Computational study is an alternative realization for model analysis; combined with data assimilation. One-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are typical mathematical models for age-structured; multi-staged disease transmission and infection progression. The model analysis and its numerical simulation attract more attention in interdisciplinary areas of applied mathematics; epidemiology and public health. Designed control is preferred for realistic consideration for policy decision. Optimization theory is the right tool to utilize to realize the ideal scenarios for better disease control and prevention.,HongbinGuo,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,Familiar with the basic theory and their numerical simulations to ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation; basic knowledge of optimization theory and its applications; basic statistical knowledge and skills to deal with data analysis; to use numerical software such as Matlab; Maple; R; Python etc. Interests on infectious disease modelling and prediction.,

32190,From Empire to Federation? Canada and Russia Compared,Given certain demographic and geographic similarities; Canada and Russia are often compared in both popular and academic discourse. While the former is viewed as a "multinational federation" the latter is portrayed as an "empire". To what extent do these labels accurately describe Russian and Canadian domestic realities? Yet; apart from the recently-published series of vignettes "Québec; Canada; Russie : 100 miroirs; Квебек – Канада – Россия; 100 зеркал" (Presses de l'Université Laval; 2016); there are few systematic comparative analyses between the two countries.

32191,Microbiome of water systems,One of the best-studied water-borne bacterial pathogens; in term of its interaction with phagocytic protozoans; is Legionella pneumophila. This species is an important; but often underestimated; cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. Transmission occurs primarily by inhalation of contaminated water droplets; but the exact mechanism and other factors influencing virulence remain unclear. Once in the lungs; Legionella infects and replicates inside alveolar macrophages and causes widespread tissue damage. Legionella grows in water system within a wide variety of phagocytic protozoans; such as amoeba and ciliates; that prey on other microorganisms. We have previously studied the microbiome of a few water systems and identified a few species of bacteria and eukarya associated with the presence or absence of Legionella. The goal of this project is to study the interactions of Legionella with the resident microbiota in water systems. To this end; we will use co-culture experiments to test the effect of different isolates on the growth and survivability of Legionella. Then; amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic analysis will be used to identify the isolates.,SebastienFaucher,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-01,The candidate should have a background in microbiology and experience with microbial isolation and cultivation.

32193,FMOps,Artificial Intelligence is gaining rapid popularity in both research and practice; due to the recent advances in the research and development of machine learning (ML). Many ML applications (e.g.; Tesla’s autonomous vehicle and Apple’s Siri) have already been used widely in people’s everyday lives. McKinsey recently estimated that ML applications have the potential to create between $3.5 and $5.8 trillion in value annually. Foundation models are large AI models trained on a vast quantity of data at scale. FM models can be used to power a wide range of downstream tasks (e.g.; chat bots; code assistants; tutors; etc.). However; there remains many challenges in terms of efficiently train; deploy and monitor such FM infrastructure. In addition; there is a lack of tools and processes to further develop applications or services on top of such FM models. The goal of this project is to develop engineering tools and best practices to support effective operationalizing FM models.,Zhen Ming (Jack)Jiang,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,- Excellent analytical and communication skills - Knowledge in AI and ML - Comfortable with programming and data analysis,
32194,Color on demand: special wide-gamut emissive polymer blends for light emission applications,We want to create high-intensity inherently luminescent polymer blends whose colors and morphology can be fully controlled. If successful; this work could create a new class of ultra-bright materials covering a wide emission bandwidth. Fluorescent polymers could replace conventional materials for a range of applications in biomedicine; sensing; imaging; and light emission applications. An important point is to control the emission spectrum of organic fluorophores for a wide range of potential applications. The synthesis methods recently were published by us. That is the starting point. Next; we want to do two major things. First; we want to develop this technique for making really well-controlled mixed color polymer blends using combinations of red; green; and blue emitting materials. Several difficulties will have to be overcome though - for example; the starting polymers must be soluble all together in the same solvents; and they must not not mix too finely when solidified into particles. Several different solvents and polymer molecular weights may have to be tested. Organic color-change fluorescent laser dyes developed in our work may play an important role as well. We would like to make mixed-color and high-brightness polymer microspheres having all the same size and structure. We plan to achieve this by using microfluidic methods; so that we can precisely control the droplet parameters; which is very different from what we achieved so far. We also pursue sensor development; for example; we recently made paper-based CO2 sensors published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces. Moreover; device development also plays an important aspect of our work; including spectroscopic cameras.,AlMeldrum,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,A reasonable level of coursework in either physics; chemistry; or engineering for a student at their respective point in the undergraduate program would be important.

32199,Nanotherapy-based treatment for human solid tumors,Drug development for the treatment of cancers encounters several problems; leading to a high attrition rate of candidate molecules at a preclinical stage. Among them; the heterogeneity of cancer cell biology is a difficult obstacle to tackle; leading to drug combination and often complex therapeutic schemes. Lately; we got interested in a recently-discovered death pathway for cancer cells and started to design a new therapeutic approach; based on drug-loaded; polymeric nanoparticles; themselves being cargoed by fluid microstructures. We are presently demonstrating the proof-of-concept of this totally innovative treatment approach. For this; two steps will be necessary: (1) the synthesis of fluorescent and drug-loaded nanocargos and their subsequent physicochemical and biological characterizations; (2) the evaluation of the permeability / efficacy of these nanocargos on various in vitro models of human solid tumors.,Valerie GaelleROULLIN,Québec,Université de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-13,An academic profile in pharmaceutical; chemical; biological or medical sciences is sought; ideally combined with a first experience of lab work; even limited.

The robot is targeted to be used in urban search and rescue operations by exploiting its full-body motion capabilities to perform complex motion tasks such as crawling; walking on rough surfaces; climbing over complex structures; and perform acrobatic maneuvers (backflips). In this project; students will start from an existing electrical and electronic architecture (develop by previous students) to generate a revised and enhanced electronic and sensing system for the robot. The electrical architecture to be developed will include a power management board to provide power to all the robot's components (e.g.; DC motors; sensors; onboard computers; etc.) via batteries; and suitable PCBs for motor control. For this; students will design and develop needed printed circuit boards (PCBs) such as power management PCBs; and emergency stop buttons. Once a suitable electrical and electronic system is completed students will manufacture the PCBs and implement them in the real robot for testing.

32201,Priming neuroblastoma 3D spheroid models for NK cell-based immunotherapy,High-risk neuroblastoma patients have a poor outcome. Treatment failure highlights the complexity to replicate neuroblastoma in preclinical models. Even though; neuroblastoma cell lines cultivated in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers carry oncogenic mutations; their transcriptome and epigenome differ considerably from tumours in situ; impeding on the discovery of efficient treatments. This has led to increasing interest in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models where the 3D microenvironment causes transcriptomic and epigenomic changes to better replicate tumour biology. Thus; we developed and characterized 3D neuroblastoma spheroids. Unlike 2D monolayers; 3D spheroids express neuroblastoma lineage-defining master transcription factors and epigenetic regulators; replicating tumours in patients. These changes correlate with novel pharmacological sensitivity to epigenetic/anticancer drugs; as compared to 2D monolayers. Moreover; 3D spheroids exhibit an immunological signature associated with resistance to natural killer (NK) cell mediated lysis; replicating neuroblastoma in situ. Cytotoxic assays using NK cells confirmed the resistance of 3D spheroids to NK cell killing; as compared to parental cells in 2D. Thus; our 3D spheroids better replicate high-risk neuroblastoma as compared to 2D monolayers and can be used to investigate resistance to NK cell immunotherapy. We hypothesize that epigenetic drugs can reprogram 3D spheroids to prime neuroblastoma cells to NK cell based lysis using NK-92 and CAR-NK cells. Overall; our proposal aims to discover drugs that prime tumour cells prior to the infusion of NK cells to to cure pediatric high-risk neuroblastoma.,NoëlRaynal,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,Skills in Cell culture amd molecular biology are an asset.

32202,Nutritional Profile of Commercial Complementary Foods for Infants in Canada,Public health guidelines recommend introducing complementary foods (CFs) to infants at 6 months of age. One of the current drivers of the infant food market is a rising demand for organic; plant-based products; yet many still contain processed ingredients. As claims related to nutrition and health are often found on commercial CF packaging; these may not be representative of the actual ingredients and nutritional composition of the product. In order to obtain an accurate representation of infant food composition and quality in Canada; a national nutritional assessment of existing products will be conducted. The aims of this study are to 1) assess the nutritional composition of CFs targeted towards infants up to 24 months of age (e.g.; energy; protein; carbohydrates; fat; sugar; iron; sodium and calcium); 2) compare the nutritional composition of organic vs non-organic plant-based CFs; 3) assess the quality of CFs; and 4) compare the food claims of commercial CFs with their actual nutrition facts. A sample of commercial CFs in Canada will be collected from websites; local supermarkets; and other food stores. Nutritional composition will be assessed by age group (Aim 1) and food type (Aim 2). Quality assessments will be conducted according to Health Canada recommendations (e.g.; food diversity) and the NOVA food classification system (i.e. degree of processing) (Aim 3). Nutrition-related claims will be classified into composition; nutrition; and health categories (Aim 4). The student will also have an opportunity to contribute to ongoing projects in the PEADS laboratory focused on breastmilk composition and the evolution of the intestinal microbiota in infants.,MaryamKebbe,New Brunswick,University of New Brunswick,English,2024-05-01,I welcome students from various backgrounds because my goals as a mentor are to provide students with the opportunity to explore new areas of research and; upon joining the lab; the training required for successful completion of the study.

32203,Bridging the Water Adaptation Gap,Bridging the Water Adaptation Gap is a planned five year (2022-2027) international research project investigating how vulnerable regions may develop sustainable adaptation strategies to address water issues exacerbated by climate change. Regions have been selected in Canada; Chile; Argentina; and Uruguay for similarities in their reliance on agriculture; and their unique vulnerabilities to water shortages (scarcity; drought) and water-related natural hazards (excess water; severe storms; catastrophic flooding). The proposed research is led by University of Regina working with an established international research team experienced in past collaborations. We are also working with Indigenous peoples in our study areas and in Canada as a vulnerable group learning from them in relation to land and language about the centrality of water to them.,margothurlbert,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,We have several activities for students to participate in depending on their interests and skills.

32207,Studying soilborne fungal pathogen Sclerotinia scleortiorum using molecular genetics and genomics,Studying soilborne fungal pathogen Sclerotinia scleortiorum using molecular genetics and genomics Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is one of the most notorious soilborne pathogens on earth. It causes white mold diseases in diverse hosts including canola; soybean; lettuce; peanuts; etc. Its ability to form sclerotia; the overwintering structure; is crucial for its survival in nature. Although this pathogen causes devastating diseases on many plants; our understanding on how it forms sclerotia and how it causes diseases in diverse hosts is limited. During the past few years; our group has developed a novel forward genetic pipeline for gene discovery in this pathogen. The student will be involved in mutant screening to search for mutants that are defective in either sclerotial formation or virulence. Once the mutants are confirmed; the DNA will be extracted for next-generation sequencing. Mutations in these mutants will be identified and downstream knockout or complementation tests will be carried out to confirm the exact mutation that is responsible for the observed phenotypes. Through the Mitacs program; the student will get training in methodologies in molecular biology; genetics; genomics and plant pathology. Genetic pathways will be analyzed; and protein-protein interactions will be assayed. He/She will be required to read original research papers and join group discussion meetings. The student will also meet regularly with the principal investigator for periodic evaluations.,XinLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-07-01,The intern student is expected to have finished courses in basic genetics; molecular genetics; molecular biology; biochemistry; cell biology and plant biology (or equivalents).

I am one of the contributors to the library; and the main co-author of the Category Theory support. There is still a lot to do; both in computer science and in mathematics.

32209,Long-Term Software Engineering,Drasil is a set of tools; written in Haskell; that provides for a completely different workflow for generating correct software; as part of large certifiable program families. One of the key ingredients is code generation; which helps make the coding of traditional artifacts more portable and more reusable. Furthermore; influenced by literate programming and org-mode; we have a means of doing knowledge capture of the fundamental laws of physics; basic mathematics and methods of software construction. Once foundational knowledge has been entered; it can be infinitely re-used. This deconstruction of software into pieces finer-grained than components; classes; etc; greatly facilitates re-use by allowing many more compositions of pieces. And because the knowledge is documented; a lot of normally tedious documentation can now be generated. The result is software that is both solid and documented; without the tedium usually associated with such tasks. The fundamental idea is to "generate all the things". By understanding what all the artifacts that usually make up a complete piece of software -- including tests; build instructions; theory manuals; user manuals; and so on -- we see that they are mostly composed of the same information but arranged in different ways. Of course; this is natural and reasonable; as the pieces are indeed talking about the same software! This very repetition is the source of our compression and re-use techniques.,JacquesCarette,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,We are looking for solid programmers who are very eager to learn new ideas. Someone who thinks they know all there is about programming will not be happy in our project; as we deconstruct all the usual methodologies of software engineering and turn them sideways. And we use ideas from many different other disciplines; while somewhat mathematics-centric; we also use a lot of physics and dip into knowledge management; philosophy and social sciences as necessary. Eagerness to learn; as well as re-learn new ways of thinking on old ideas; is very important.,Computer Science; Engg-Software; Engg-Computer; Engg-Civil; Engg-Mechanical; Mathematics; Physics
32210,Exploring databases in digital forensic investigations,Because databases play a critical role in many computing systems and organizations; they are often exploited to facilitate crimes or hide information that can be useful during digital investigations. Database forensics research has seen some advances over the last decade but several aspects of forensic investigations involving database systems are yet to be addressed. In earlier work; we showed that different dimensions can be involved in a database forensic analysis. Much of the existing research works have focused on different aspects of these dimensions but in many cases from the perspective of specific database management systems; mostly relational databases. Thus; limiting the ability to incorporate some of the results into tools and practices. In addition; although database forensics is in practice a part of the digital investigation process; it has not been explored as such. The goal of the project is to consider database forensics through the lens of more established subdisciplines of digital forensics such as mobile forensics; network forensics; multimedia forensics; and computer forensics to provide insights into aspects of database forensics that are yet to be addressed. By considering each of the phases of the digital forensics process; we will review existing works in other subdomains of digital forensics to identify aspects of database forensics that require further research attention to advance the field. In addition; we will explore the integration of database forensics in the forensic analysis of mobile devices using data corpora for digital forensics research. Through this; we aim to provide guidelines for integrating information from the databases on many digital devices into the forensics investigation of such devices.,Mary OluwasolaAdedayo,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-13,We seek students with prior knowledge of both relational and non-relational database systems and an interest in digital forensics and/or cybersecurity.

32211,Comparative study of machine learning based approaches for file type identification,The ability to identify the type of a file and by extension; its structure is an important aspect of digital forensics analysis and computer security in general. For example; it is useful for intrusion detection systems; firewalls; the development of antiviruses; steganalysis; etc. Over the years; a considerable amount of research has been conducted on identifying file types from file fragments and several methods that use the content-based approach e.g.; File header/trailer analysis have been widely adopted. More recently; approaches that are based on the classification of file fragments using machine learning techniques have been explored or combined with content-based approaches. The goal of this project is to conduct a comparative study of the machine learning approaches for file type identification. The project will focus on both the analysis of complete files as well as those of file fragments. We aim to identify the challenges and benefits of the different approaches. This project forms part of the exploratory phase of a larger objective to develop approaches for authenticating digital documents. The first phase of the project will involve an understanding of existing techniques for file type identification through a review of existing literature. The second phase will involve a comparative study of some of the popular approaches identified in the first phase. Through this study; we hope to identify key features and approaches that can be leveraged when analyzing files to identify other details that can be useful for forensic digital document examination.,Mary OluwasolaAdedayo,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-13,We seek students with some computer science background and an interest in digital forensics and/or cybersecurity.

32212,Feminist urban spaces,This research project involves feminist urban spaces; particularly recent ones. Spatial structure and social structure are mutually constitutive. Place is invested with meaning (Spain; 2014). Feminist urban spaces have existed since the 1970s in the form of community centres; libraries; feminist associations and help centres. Most of them were created by feminist associations as a reference point for the feminist movement and as an outreach to women. Just as feminist in the 1970s and 1980s built their rights into the city with women’s centers; credit unions; and feminist health clinics; feminists in the 2020s are building their right to the city with public spaces and urban commons. These places created by and for women; declare women’s rights to public space. A new generation of feminist spaces both in buildings and feminist public spaces have emerged in cities such as Rome; Barcelona; and Montevideo. This exploratory reseach project aims at documenting the different types of feminist urban spaces in Europe; Latin America and Canada; documenting their dates of creating; their functioning; the feminist theories and practices around them and their influence on the feminist movement and urban environment. We will expore questions such as: How do these places empower women? How can cities and urban spaces be potentially emancipatory if the appropriate conditions and interventions are nurtured (Chant; 2016)? The goals of this research project are to gather information and empirical data on feminist urban spaces and to explore the literature around theories on feminist spaces and urban feminism. This will include documentary research on the feminist urban spaces: when and how they emerged; how long they have existed and the changes they have went through; who runs them and who uses their services and space; what kind of governance exists.,CharmainLevy,Québec,Université du Québec en Outaouais,Either English or French,2024-06-10,The student should have a strong background in social sciences (sociology; anthropology; womens/feminist studies or urban studies).

32213,Between Migration and Neo-Nationalism(s): Performing the European Nation -- Playing a Foreigner,The recent rise of the political far right in Europe; including the Brexit movement in the UK; the Front National in France; and the autocracy in Russia; to name a few; positions theater and performance arts at the fore-front of cultural resistance and mediation. This project examines the role performance arts can play in seeking new methods to communicate the difficult nexus between migration and neo-nationalism. I will study the strategies used by five European theatre companies to negotiate the limitations imposed on their work by their state-generated funding while at the same time maintaining their artistic and political freedom. The only art form that must be experienced live; performance arts (including text based theatre and dance) carry strong traditions and means to provoke and challenge the authority of the state and its politics. Not only did nationalism in the forms of its totalitarian systems and fascism mark the historical experience of the 20th century Europe; it also stimulated the escalation of theatrical traditions to respond and to resist its political and ideological practices,YanaMeerzon,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,My research assistant is expected to have advanced skills in reading and working with academic literature in the fields of cultural studies; sociology; literature or performance studies.

32214,Algorithmic and digital policing,Many law enforcement agencies use artificial intelligence and algorithmic technologies in their work. Little research has been done on exploring some of the different uses of AI and algorithmic technologies to understand their limitations and aspects of technology that are being ignored in their use. This project is part of a bigger project that aims to address this using different research methods. The project aims to explore existing literature that documents the use of technology; AI; and algorithmic tools for law enforcement. Based on the initial analysis; we will focus on the technologies that are mostly used to identify how such technologies can be improved for the justice system and to address human rights concerns that have been identified with the use of some technologies. This project supplements other related works that use alternative other research methods to address similar questions for a complete view of the research problem.,Mary OluwasolaAdedayo,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-13,We seek students with some technical knowledge; who demonstrates excellence in courses such as Database systems; Data structures and algorithms; Operating systems; Computer architecture; and system software.

32217,Targeted mutagenesis of candidate cis-regulatory elements in rice (Oryza sativa) using CRISPR/Cas9,Plants have unique strategies for countering changes in their environment. reprogramming gene expression. Although the the importance of cis-regulatory elements in gene regulation has been demonstrated in many genomes; their effect on transcriptional reprogramming and their specific response to stress remains poorly understood in plants. Transposable elements; abundant and diverse mobile sequences of non-coding DNA; can be key sources of cis-regulatory sequences. An evolutionary process known as exaptation causes transposable element sequences to change function; serving as raw material for the emergence of sequences useful to the host genome. In plants; there is still relatively little experimental evidence for the role of exaptation of transposable elements into cis-regulatory sequences. The aim of our research project is to develop an integrative approach combining bioinformatics and genome editing; in order to better understand the impact of cis-regulatory sequences exapted from transposable elements in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. We have already identified candidate sequences; and the proposed project for the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship is to assist in the experimental phase. To experimentally test the effect of candidate cis-regulatory sequences on gene regulation; we will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genetic excision of candidates in the rice genome. We will use a CRISPR-Cas9 protocol already optimized in the laboratory from the infection of rice callus (clusters of undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells obtained from rice seeds). To assess the impact of cis-regulatory element mutations on gene expression; plants homozygous for the mutation will be subjected to RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis to detect mutation-induced changes in gene expression.,ZoéJoly-Lopez,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-27,The candidate must have completed a course in genetics and/or molecular biology.

32219,Biostability of food protein-based nanodelivery vehicles,The inherent structural and biophysicochemical properties of proteins; such as binding; encapsulation; stability; biocompatibility; biorecognition; bioavailability and biodegradability; have contributed to the applications of various kinds of proteins as delivery agents for functional food formulation. They have also been widely used in the food; pharmaceutical and medical industry for the delivery of bioactive compounds; but little attention has been given to some of the potential health effects. It is overgeneralization as observed in most literature to assume that proteins should digest after delivery of bioactive compounds; considering the small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio of protein nanoparticles. The interaction of protein nanoparticles with bioactive compounds and gastrointestinal fluid may affect the engineered properties of the proteins. Limited information is available on the possible bioaccumulation of organic (e.g. protein) nanoparticle and their interaction with biological systems (cell; tissue and organ). Also; there is need to explore how the structure of a given protein can pose a negative health effect when used as delivery agents; especially during interaction with the bioactive compounds and gastrointestinal fluid. It is also necessary to investigate how the structure of proteins and the biological environment can affect the desired target release. This study will involve the use of various simulated gastrointestinal and biological models; advanced techniques and various characterization methods to understand the interaction of protein nanodelivery agents and the gastrointestinal system. The research will evaluate the stability of the nanoparticles and if they can interact with the components of a simulated gastrointestinal environment. The project will also investigate the localization; biological fate and behaviours of the food protein nanoparticles.,ChibuikeUdenigwe,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-08,Student should have an academic background in any of the following undergraduate courses: chemistry; biochemistry; biology; physics; nutrition; or pharmaceutical sciences.

32221,Machine Learning of Auto Insurance Big Data for Before, During, and Post Pandemic,Much research focuses on studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; but less work is addressing problems on the effect of the post-COVID-19 pandemic when compared to before and during the pandemic. In the domain of auto insurance; some research questions may be asked: • What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in future regulation rules such as the benchmarks of the major risk factors? • What will be the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic when it comes to Usage-Based Insurance (UBI); where driving habits and driving distances are critical components in pricing? • Does the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lead to a necessary reform of auto insurance benefit coverage? The issues discussed above will significantly impact the decision-making of auto insurance rate filings; as they will affect future insurance premium rate changes. Especially the impact on UBI because working remotely may become a new norm after the pandemic. On the other hand; the social and economic impact of COVID 19 can lead to a significant change in the insurance market; and the fairness of insurance premiums may also be affected. Thus; to ensure that the premium levels are fair and correct for all drivers; which is required by the regulation rules; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cost-saving and the future insurance premium rate changes must be studied. This impact of COVID-19 may include before; during; and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore; the cost reduction (or; in some cases; potential increase) due to the COVID-19 pandemic must be reflected in new premium calculations and insurance regulations. This research mainly focus on analyzing statistical plan data to answer all existing and future research questions; with an aim to see the effect from COVID-19 pandemic on loss and premium patterns.,ShengkunXie,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-06-03,Students should have knowledge and skills in collecting and organizing data and conducting statistical analysis and modeling using both statistical and computational approaches.

32222,Bacterial consortium for plant growth promotion,In this project; the student will be responsible for formulating bacterial consortia from natural isolates and other strains from the laboratory. First; in vitro and in planta antagonism tests will be performed to determine the compatibility of the strains. Then; the strains will be inoculated alone or together on plants of interest; and their effect on plant growth will be examined using a state-of-the-art phenotyping platform. The proportion of different strains and their ability to colonize the root will be monitored over time by enumeration or 16S region qPCR. In a second step; the consortia capable of effectively promoting plant growth will be tested under abiotic stress conditions (water stress; temperature increase; low soil nutrient levels) to determine if they still act beneficially. Also; monitoring the different species of bacteria in these consortia will allow us to determine how the bacterial consortia adapt to the environment; and whether or not the communities are stable.,Pascale B.Beauregard,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-07-29,The student must have a strong background in microbiology and be familiar with the theory of common molecular biology techniques (PCR; agarose gels; dilution and enumeration; (...)).

32223,Vaccine developing for porcine coronavirus,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in serious losses of human lives as well as the global economy. Vaccination has been one of the most effective measures in combating the pandemic. Coronaviruses can cause devastating consequences in animals as well. For example; porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alpha-coronavirus that causes up to 100% fatality in newborn piglets. Like the SARS-CoV-2 virus; multiple PEDV variants have emerged in pig farms. Unfortunately; current vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against PEDV infections. The Mitacs research intern student will receive training on antigen discovery; a critical and first step in vaccine development.,QiangLiu,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Basic background knowledge of virology and molecular biology is required.,Microbiology
32224,Quantum control of molecular super-rotors with an optical centrifuge,MAIN OBJECTIVE. Our research is focused on expanding the boundaries of controlling quantum systems with light. Specifically; we develop new methods of exciting extreme rotational states of molecules – the so called “molecular super-rotors”; and investigate the effects of ultra-fast rotation on the quantum systems of interest; e.g. superfluid helium and helium nanodroplets. BACKGROUND. Control of molecular rotation has been long recognized and successfully used as a powerful tool for steering chemical reactions; imaging individual molecular orbitals; generating extreme ultraviolet radiation; deflecting molecular beams and separating molecular isotopes. Recent theoretical studies have indicated enormous potential of extending the reach of rotational control to ultra-high rotational states. Ultrafast molecular spinning has been predicted to change the character of molecular collisions with solid surfaces; alter molecular trajectories in external fields and suppress collisional decoherence. New ways of molecular cooling and selective chemical bond breaking by inducing super rotation have been suggested. Yet; owing to the challenges of bringing a large number of molecules to fast synchronous rotation; very little experimental work has been done on molecular super rotors. METHODOLOGY. Our research team is developing two new approaches to ultrafast rotational control of molecules. (1) We have recently built an “optical centrifuge” in which molecular rotation is achieved by forcing the molecules to follow the rotating polarization of a laser field. Using the centrifuge technique; we have succeeded in producing; observing and controlling molecular super rotors. (2) We are also developing a method of exciting extreme rotational states with high-power ultra-short pulse trains. Each laser pulse in the train exerts a small torque on a molecule; making it rotate toward the field polarization. The cumulative effect of multiple pulses enables one to induce fast molecular rotation without breaking the molecule apart.,ValeryMilner,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,We are looking for a senior student with experience in the field of optics.

This project will involve screening hundreds of inoculants against a variety of plants to identify changes in root growth and architecture by imaging roots and using computational methods to estimate root traits. The most promising of these crop-inoculant pairs will be screened for nutrient use traits using physiological and biochemical assays.,OliviaWilkins,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a strong background in molecular biology; computation; microbiology or plant physiology. The student should have skills in plant or microbial culture techniques; record keeping; statistics; data analysis in R (or eagerness to learn R).,
32226,Cell-Matrix adhesion in tissue development & homeostasis 2024,Cell adhesion regulation plays a key role in animal development and tissue maintenance: Adhesion proteins of the integrin family are the core components of an adhesion complex that is important for attaching cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins are involved in many biological processes including cell migration; organogenesis; and the maintenance of tissue integrity under conditions of mechanical stress. Our lab looks at how the regulation of the assembly; strength; and turnover of integrin adhesions contributes to animal development and tissue maintenance. My lab uses genome-engineering techniques to create animal models containing mutations that disrupt key regulatory mechanisms that control integrin-mediated Cell-ECM adhesion. We then analyse these mutants in diverse biological contexts. The MITACS funded project will involve analysing such animal models using advanced quantitative imaging; live imaging of primary cell culture and cultured whole embryos and explants. Moreover; histology and immunohistochemistry will be used to analyse functional defects that arise during embryonic development that effect the regulation of cell migration and stable cell adhesion. The work will be carried out in either the genetic model organism Drosophila Melanogaster or in mouse models. Working under the supervision of a senior member of the lab the student will learn cutting edge techniques of imaging to analyse the cell morphology; cell migration; and localization of intracellular components in different compartments within cells of interest. The work carried out by the student will provide novel insight into the physiological roles of different regulatory mechanisms that operate on integrin-based adhesions.,GuyTanentzapf,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,We are seeking an eager; hard-working student interested in the fields of developmental and cell biology; and advanced imaging technology.

32228,Intelligence-Driven Smart Contracts Vulnerability Detection and Characterization System (SCsVulLyzer),The research project; SCsVulLyzer; aims to develop an automated system that utilizes genetic algorithms to analyze and detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts that automatically enforce the rules and regulations of an agreement between parties. These contracts are often executed on a blockchain; which provides a secure and decentralized environment for conducting transactions. However; smart contracts are also vulnerable to various types of attacks; such as reentrancy and integer overflow attacks. The proposed system will analyze the bytecode of smart contracts and identify vulnerabilities using a genetic algorithm.,ArashHabibi Lashkari,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,In addition to developing the SCsVulLyzer system; the project will also involve generating a benchmark dataset of vulnerable and non-vulnerable smart contracts to evaluate the performance of the system. This benchmark dataset will be an essential component of the project as it will provide a standard for evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the system.,Computer Science
32229,Fast and non-destructive spectroscopic characterization of soil health,Sustainable soil management is only possible through better management which is dependent on better measurement. However; the status quo approach to characterize soil relies on systematic soil sampling followed by laboratory analysis which is often inadequate; economically infeasible; and unbiased measurement density that makes the quality of the obtained information and management decisions questionable. Many proximal soil sensing systems are based on measuring the soil’s ability to reflect or emit energy in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with a wavelength range of 350-2500 nm has gained tremendous attention as it can simultaneously predict multiple soil properties. This project aims to develop a fast and non-destructive soil health characterization technique using soil spectroscopy. The project will involve collecting soil samples; organizing; processing; and analyzing them in the laboratory; scanning soils using spectrometers; and developing a database and predictive relationships using machine learning techniques.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in handling soil samples in the laboratory and in the field. Background on measuring soil properties in the field and collecting soil samples for measurement in the laboratory is required.

32230,Developing a cell phone app to characterize soil organic matter,Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered as the backbone of soil health or soil quality and influences many physical; chemical and biological properties and processes. For example; SOM influences soil structure; affects water holding capacity; nutrient contributions; biological activity; water infiltration; air exchange; pesticide activity; soil compressibility; and shear strength. It is a critically important property that determines soil functionality and use. Proper characterization of SOM can help make informed management decisions for agro-environmental operations. The two most common methods of SOM estimation are Walkley Black acid digestion and weight loss on ignition. However; the requirement of specialized equipment's; trained professionals; time for analysis and sample preparation; cost; and labor pose challenges in measuring SOM on a large number of samples in order to characterize and map soils with high spatial variability. Spectroscopic characteristics measured using Vis-NIR or NIR sensors have shown promise in predicting SOM in laboratory ex-situ conditions or at the field in situ conditions. However; the high price and often the portability of these instruments restrict their common use. With the advancement of imaging techniques and the development of computing powers; computer vision-based image analysis techniques show promise to characterize soil properties including SOM as it contributes to the color of the soil. Along with good cameras and other advanced imaging techniques; cell phones became an increasingly popular device for photographs. The availability of cell phones with high processing power and image collection capability could provide us new ways to characterize soil. This project aims to develop a cell phone app to characterize SOM. In developing the app; reliable and robust image analysis algorithms need to be developed. So; the first part of the project is to develop an algorithm that can analyze images of various qualities and then develop an app for cell phones.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in cell phone app development; computer programming; and image processing is required with desirable knowledge on image collection or photography using different types of camera; taking the photographs of soil samples; collecting and processing soil samples in the laboratory and in the field; and setting up laboratory conditions to take images. Knowledge of coding (mainly in Matlab) to automatize the image processing algorithm and image collection system using a computer is required. Critical thinking and comprehending knowledge are also required in this project.,
32231,Performance verification study of OncoProfiler for multiple cancer diagnosis,The cancer diagnosis process may seem long and frustrating because of the high false-positive rate; 10% for a mammogram and 30-50% for low-dose CT; the gold standard methods for screening breast cancer and lung cancer; respectively. Follow-up tests have to be performed with additional imaging or tissue-biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. In addition to the invasive nature of these processes; image and tissue biopsy-based diagnosis methods can detect tumors only when it is above 1 cm size: by then some cancers progress to advanced stages. As a non-invasive test; blood-based liquid biopsy diagnostics has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of current techniques. Proteins and peptides in blood plasma are commonly used as biomarkers to indicate the presence of cancer. Since these biomarkers are not unique to cancer; they are not used to confirm the diagnosis but to indicate further cancer tests. Besides; blood biomarkers cannot predict the localization of cancer or sub-typing of cancer without histology. Detection of mutations in the very early stages is almost impossible. Therefore; existing methods of liquid biopsy remain as a complementary tool in cancer diagnosis. The clinical utility of blood-based cancer diagnosis is still minimal. Researchers at Toronto Metropolitan University have invented OncoProfiler; a quantum sensor enhanced Raman microscopy. The device offers single-molecular detection sensitivity and is capable of identifying biomarkers that are previous undetectable due to their extreme low concentration in blood stream. By employing new biomarkers; OncoProfiler has demonstrated high accuracy in cancer diagnosis from patient blood samples. The proposed project tests the performance of OncoProfiler with a large set of blood samples from patients with confirmed cancer diagnosis. We aim to test 12 different types of cancers; including colorectal; bladder; head and neck; hepatobiliary; lung; lymphoma; leukemia; ovary; pancreas; myeloma; esophageal/gastric; breast; thyroid; kidney; endometrium; prostate; melanoma; and sarcoma.,BoTan,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,Formal education in Biomedical engineering; medical science and related field; experience of lab experiments; graphic generation and editing; knowledge of machine learning is a plus.,Engg-Biomedical; Engg-Biological; Medical Sciences
32232,Medical image segmentation using machine learning,Many medical imaging modalities generate a large number of images per patient in each scan. For instance; a typical short-axis cardiac MRI sequence consists of more than 200 images; and manual segmentation of ventricles from all these images might take more than 20 minutes. Only a limited set of measurements associated with the scan is computed in regular clinical practice. Automating the analysis could lead to a comprehensive analysis of the underlying condition. However; automating the analysis using traditional image processing approaches poses a number of challenges; including accurately identifying the regions of interest. Recent studies have shown that deep learning approaches have the ability to accurately delineate the regions of interest provided that they are trained with sufficient data. This study aims to utilize deep learning to delineate structures from medical images. The project will exploit the recent advances in deep learning-based segmentation approaches proposed for general computer vision applications. We will rely on the original medical images and the corresponding annotations produced by expert clinicians to train; validate and test deep learning solutions. Obtaining large datasets to train neural network algorithms is often a challenge in medical imaging. This project will utilize data augmentation and cross-validation strategies to deal with the limited dataset problems.,KumarPunithakumar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The project requires programming skills in Python.

32233,Development of extended reality image visualization techniques for medical images,Our lab focuses on the development of advanced 3D visualization and navigation approaches to facilitate the analysis of cardiac ultrasound; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) data. Although the actual heart motion is a complex set of motions in 3D space; current clinical settings are capable of visualizing them only in 2D. We develop stereographic and virtual environments to facilitate the interactions between radiologists; cardiologists and surgeons in planning surgical and other procedures. Most of the existing medical visualization systems rely on the keyboard and mouse of a personal computer for user interaction; and therefore; have limited interaction in 3D. A system based on zSpace (zSpace Inc.; Sunnyvale; CA; USA) is expected to overcome these limitations via the use of a stylus and other types of input devices that allow users to interact in 3D space. The zSpace system also consists of a high-definition 3D stereo display system and has the ability to track the viewing angle of the user. The proposed project will focus on development of the display system for medical images by using the Unity3D (Unity Technologies; San Francisco; CA; USA) development environment. An advantage of using Unity3D is that it can be adapted to other types of display devices such as head-mounted displays (Oculus Rift; HTC Vive; etc.) with minimal additional programming. Beyond programming the stylus based interaction; the project will also investigate the usage of different input devices such as a game or Xbox controller; Leap Motion controller (Leap Motion Inc.; San Francisco; CA; USA) and 3D mouse to improve the user’s ability to interact with the 3D environment.,KumarPunithakumar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The project requires programming skills in C# and Python.

Programming experience with gaming engines such as Unity3D would be an asset.,
32234,Systematic Quantitation of Glycoxidative Stress in Biological Systems,Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in the cell. It is chemically reactive and can undergo an undesired reaction with different classes of biomolecules; such as amino acids and proteins; affecting their physicochemical properties and potentially their biological functions. Known as nonenzymatic glycation; this reaction generally occurs at a slow rate and is a major component of the aging process in living organisms. A broad range of physiological complications; such as diabetes; cataracts; neurodegenerative diseases; and cardiovascular diseases has been linked to nonenzymatic glycation. Previous studies have shown that nonenzymatic glycation accelerates under oxidative stress conditions. Heavy metals; such as iron and copper; can induce oxidation and facilitate oxidative reactions. Some studies have; therefore; postulated that selective decreasing of endogenous metal levels may have a controlling effect on nonenzymatic glycation. Several classes of natural compounds that bind the excess amounts of heavy metals were found to have an inhibitory effect on nonenzymatic glycation in humans; however; the underlying mechanism of this process is not fully understood. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop methods for quantitative study of nonenzymatic glycation in biological systems. Through this project; we aim to identify new biomarkers that can help better understand the glycation reaction at a systemic level and develop methods to monitor and control the nonenzymatic glycation reaction in living organisms.,MakanGolizeh,Alberta,Concordia University of Edmonton,English,2024-05-13,The student must have the basic understanding of analytical chemistry; especially of biological systems.

32237,Big data analytics for intelligent manufacturing,Nowadays; manufacturing is towards smart factories at a high pace. Turning into intelligent manufacturing enables a lot of challenges for engineers. Smart factories have tones of sensors with a high frequency of sense. That means different types of data are generated at high speed and high volume. In other words; we have all three factors of big data; variety; velocity and volume. Handling big data has different types of challenges. First; there is a need to manage the communication between sensors and handle the data flow. Second; logging the generated data in real-time is vital. Third; store the data in the proper database considering the data structure and query types. Fourth; real-time data analytics of the stored or streamed data. Dealing with all of the above challenges is tough; especially in manufacturing. In manufacturing; multiple sensors need to communicate and there is a need to record the events due to the scheduling; optimization and security tasks. This project will focus on the design and development of the workflows and data management frameworks that work in the context of industrial big data. To this node; we employ different types of technologies such as Kafka; Apache Spark and ELK stack; along with some other relational and non-relational DBMSs. In addition; blockchain technology and distributed computing algorithms can help us to parallelise the computation.,HomayounNajjaran,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-15,The successful candidate will need to have skills in programming; data visualization; data mining; predictive analytics; and quantitative analysis but must also be interested in machine learning; artificial intelligence.,
32238,Connecting Best Practices for Teaching Linguistically and Culturally-Diverse International Students with International Student Satisfaction and Student Perceptions of Learning,We are engaged with conducting research that explores the promising teaching practices for teaching linguistically and culturally diverse international students by identifying the teaching practices and individual instructor characteristics that have high levels of international student satisfaction and student learning. In phase 1; we used a mixed-methods research design to focus generally on the connection between teaching practices and student satisfaction; including variability by country of origin; study level; program of study; study time; study stage; and age. In phase 2; we used a qualitative research design to investigate the difference between STEM and non-STEM students with regard to the connection between teaching practices and student satisfaction. In phase 3; we used a qualitative research design to examine the attitudes of online international students with regard to teaching practices and student satisfaction. This led us to sponsor a research symposium; edit a special edition journal; and to publish the IGI Global book; Handbook of Research on Teaching Strategies for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse International Students (DOI: 10.4018/978-1-7998-8921-2). This project will build on the earlier research phases and focus on building an online tool to help instructors select appropriate promising teaching practices that will include a micro-credential.

32239,Artificial Intelligence for Industry 4.0,Corporations are increasingly interested in adopting Industry 4.0 in their production and services because of its ability to boost their competitive strength in global markets. The provision of individualized mass customization in Industry 4.0; on the one hand; satisfies personalized needs; quality and cost constraints and; on the other hand; enables the businesses to respond to the environmental; energy and other global challenges. In a manufacturing process; this combination requires a smart factory with remarkably flexible operation of not only machines but also self-conscious products to swiftly respond to change in every step of the process. The smart factory is composed of smart machines and product components; communication networks; cloud services; and control terminals. These comprise the hardware for computation; communication and control (3Cs) of smart production; but the autonomy of production in the smart factory still requires the ability to analyze a great volume of data and determine the best possible actions in real time. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the brain of the smart factory and serves two main purposes. First; it filters; analyzes and ultimately learns from the big data mostly generated through machine to machine (M2M) communication in the smart factory. Big data analytics can; for example; be used for digital twins or predictive manufacturing to provide early warning and prevent catastrophic failures. Second; AI provides reasoning and autonomous decision making tools that have the ability to analyze and adapt to new situations. This is not a trivial task since decisions have to be made based on uncertain information and imperfect data. This project will focus on some of the machine learning and approximate reasoning techniques that can work for the AI component of a smart factory.,HomayounNajjaran,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-15,The successful candidate will need to have skills in programming; hardware; and electronics but must also be interested in computer vision; machine learning; artificial intelligence; mechatronics; and robotic systems.,
32240,Emerging topics and technologies in robotics and unmanned systems,For a few decades; the diversity of robotics technology and its applications has continuously expanded at an increasing rate mainly with respect to the environments where their actions take place. Robots’ task space is no longer limited to a designated; well-defined and structured environment. Modern applications require that a robot move and operate safely in an unknown environment shared by static and moving objects. Recently; major breakthroughs including active and semantic SLAM algorithms; robust object detection and tracking techniques using machine learning; and finally feedback motion planning methods in conjunction with differential constraints and sampling based planning have shown potential research directions in this field. However; there is still vast research opportunities for improvement and further research to relax the underlying assumptions (typically made to approximate quasi-static processes); and alleviate the shortcomings of these implementations often limited by the high computational cost; low dimensional analyses; sensing uncertainty and a need for additional behavioral information about the surrounding objects. The core research on autonomy of multiple robots in dynamic environment planned in the ACIS laboratory relies on the development of a versatile and effective testing platform for object identification and tracking; localization and mapping and motion planning and execution of a distributed network of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles (UGVs and UAVs). The testing platform will be capable of coordinating the autonomous navigation of UAVs with the ground vehicles to maintain a certain formation while avoiding the obstacles in the environment. In addition; this platform will be used as a test bed for multi-robot distributed task allocation in real world applications such as autonomous firefighting systems. The expansion of the testing platform to formation control; aerial autonomous navigation; and collaborative unmanned systems is important for the success of our ongoing academic and industrial projects.,HomayounNajjaran,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-15,The ACIS laboratory is interested in hosting a senior Mechanical; Electrical; Computer; or Mechatronics Engineering student with strong background in system design and software and hardware development.

32243,Novel biocarbon-based materials for light weight EV parts,My research group was the first in the world to demonstrate that biocarbon derived from biomass can be a viable alternative to carbon black and mineral fillers in polymer composites. We have demonstrated that biocarbon can displace up to 40% of plastic in composites. This reduces the demand for virgin plastics as well as the composite weight by substituting commonly used fillers of higher densities. The breakthrough technology enables ecofriendly lightweight biocomposites to be used in a wide range of applications including packaging and automotive parts. The research project will explore innovative strategies of utilization of recycled plastics biocarbon for sustainable composite materials. The most effective approach to stop the inflow of additional fossil carbon to combat climate change is to utilize carbon already extracted. One part of research will be carbon filler surface engineering. The generated sustainable carbon will be activated to induce exfoliation and activation of the material. For surface modifications; maleation and silane treatment will be used to graft different active groups on the surface to facilitate strong interfacial adhesions and moisture resistance. Second part of the project will be to create hybrid composites with biographite and blends of virgin and recycled plastics. Surface-modified carbon will be used as a filler in blends of virgin and recycled plastics to achieve the thermomechanical properties and processability required for manufacturing.

32245,Isolation of natural and “unnatural” anticancer compound,Approximately 60% of drugs originate from or are inspired by plant natural products. However; the potential of many of these compounds is not fully realized as they could only be produced in low amounts by a small number of slow-growing or endangered species; and/or by expensive chemical synthesis. Alkaloids are widely used for the treatment of various types of cancers but in some cases are not ideal for treatment owing to their low solubility; side effects; and drug resistance. It is therefore desirable to devise ways; such as halogenation; to alter its pharmacokinetics and potency as medical agents. New-to-nature alkaloid analogues could possess improved bioactivities and availability compared to their natural counterparts. In this project; the student will diversify alkaloid scaffolds via mutasynthesis and enzymes. The student will learn how to identify and isolate alkaloids from different sources such as plant materials; yeast cell cultures and enzymatic assays.

32247,How neural stem cells build, maintain and regenerate the brain,In my lab we study how adult neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) produce oligodendrocytes; brain cells that produce myelin. We ask how neural stem cells and OPCs contribute to the disease and how can they be pharmacologically mobilized for enhanced oligodendrocyte replacement and remyelination. For MS disease mechanisms; we ask how neural stem cells interact with microglia (brain immune cells); and affect both brain development and demyelination later in life (PMID: 36937181). For pro-regenerative approaches in MS; we ask how neuronally secreted molecules regulate myelination and oligodendrocyte (re)generation from neural stem cells and OPCs (PMIDs: 31629772; 36608690; 35293825; 34270934).

32248,Nanotechnology with DNA origami,This cutting edge; interdisciplinary project requires the student to design two-dimensional and three-dimensional DNA structures. The exact shape will depend on the application. For the ‘synthetic leaves’ project; these structures will be discs; spheres; and octahedrons. These structures will be constructed using DNA origami techniques and characterized using a variety of biochemical methods and ultra-sensitive atomic-force and electron microscopes that can resolve nanometer-sized shapes. Once accomplished; we will combine dyes that intercalate (bind between DNA base pairs) or bind in the major groove of DNA to these folded DNA structures. This will need further characterization to ascertain the amount and position of dye binding. To test the efficiency of these new complexes; we will measure their absorption and energy-transfer properties using time-resolved spectroscopy approaches. Energy transfer between dyes is very fast; occurring in one billionth of a second or faster. We will use cutting-edge ultrafast laser techniques combined with non-linear optical methods to measure and analyze this process. This would not only help us move one step closer to making a synthetic leaf light-harvester; but would also help researchers understand the fundamental energy transfer and molecular interaction parameters that are essential for the creation of new materials. Only a handful of research groups in the world work on these research topics and the student will become proficient in all these laboratory techniques; while gaining transferable skills; such as improved written and oral communication; effective teamworking; and advanced critical thinking; which would be an asset in any academic endeavor or future career.

32256,Coordination of mitotic exit by the BUB1/BUBR1 complex,The signalling mechanism that prevents incorrect segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This pathway detects the absence of interactions between dividing chromosomes and the mitotic spindle; the large cytoskeletal structure responsible for chromosome movement to new daughter cells. The final step of the SAC pathway is the assembly of a complex called the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) which functions like a “stop” signal; delaying cell division until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle. The SAC and MCC are therefore crucial mechanisms of maintaining genome integrity during cell division. Once chromosome-spindle attachments are correctly formed; the MCC must be disassembled to allow completion of mitosis. A major step in MCC formation is the interaction between two related proteins BUB1 and BUBR1. Although we understand how this complex is formed; little is known about how this complex is disassembled to permit exit from mitosis. In this project; we will explore this mechanism of interaction between BUB1 and BUBR1 and determine how this complex contributes to the accurate segregation of chromosomes. The project is divided into 3 aims: 1. Determine how the BUB1-BUBR1 interaction is regulated by phosphorylation; a post-translational mechanism essential for mitosis. This will be performed using biochemical approaches/tools including phosphorylation assays; chemical inhibitors; immunoprecipitation and western blotting. 2. Identify the enzymes (kinases) responsible for the BUB1-BUBR1 interaction and the sites of phosphorylation involved. This will be done using mass-spectrometry approaches. 3. Define the importance of the phosphorylation sites for the fidelity of chromosome segregation. This will be done by imaging approaches including high resolution; and live-cell imaging techniques. This project will be performed under the guidance of the supervisor and a senior graduate student. All the assays are established in the Elowe lab and all necessary equipment and reagents are in place.,SabineElowe,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,- Good communication skills and a strong work ethic. - Enthusiasm; ambition and interest in the project. - Ability to work in a team-environment. - Previous laboratory experience in cell biology and/or molecular biology is an asset but not necessary.,Biological Sciences; Biochemistry; Biology; Molecular Biology
32257,Towards understanding the role of kinetochore aberrations in breast cancer progression,Kinetochore Project description: Breast Cancer (BC) is a highly heterogenous disease with some cases being associated with slow growth and excellent prognosis whilst other tumors exhibit a highly aggressive clinical course. Using a cell culture model of breast cancer progression; we have identified using genomic approaches and cell biology approaches that cells from a BC ‘continuum’ series that mimics the different stages of cancer progression exhibit a stage-dependent increase in structural and numerical centrosome defects. In human cells; centrosomes form the poles of the mitotic spindle which is responsible for binding to and segregating chromosomes. Consequently; dividing cells in this series exhibit chromosome segregation defects that increase with disease progression. Using genomic methods; we have found that some of the most effected cell cycle genes are those implicated in kinetochore maintenance. In this project; we will use cell biology and molecular biology techniques to determine the contribution of kinetochore defects to BC progression. Three aims are envisioned to test this hypothesis: AIM1: To detail mitotic defects leading to chromosome missegregation in the BC continuum model. We will use high resolution microscopy; live-cell imaging and image analysis to observe; quantify and catalog the mitotic defects in the BC series. AIM2: To characterize kinetochore defects in the BC continuum and correlate them with disease stage using similar approaches as aim1. AIM3: Identify changes in expression of mitotic genes from the BC series human transcriptome arrays (HTA) and correlate to the identified mitotic defects. Our collaborators have generated genome-wide transcriptome of the different stages of BC from the continuum series as well as patient samples. We will use this dataset to identify mitotic genes that are implicated in BC initiation and progression.

32258,Immune Cells Classification Using Deep Neural Networks,Cells of the innate immune system form a critical part of our bodies defense against pathogens; parasites; and cancer. Phagocytes consume these enemies by engulfing (‘eating’) the target in a process called phagocytosis. Being able to predict how an immune cell makes the decision ‘to eat; or not to eat’ is critical for our understanding of how to engineer the immune system in cutting edge immunotherapies. This interdisciplinary project will combine themes from engineering; biology; and artificial intelligence to address this challenge. The student will build a custom microscope to image the process of phagocytosis in real time. Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI); and in particular Deep Neural Networks (DNN); are becoming essential in a variety of our day-to-day scientific applications. The image data obtained from this project will be processed and analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network to classify cells as either big or small eaters and will lead to new insights into the process of phagocytosis and immune cell diversity.,HashimMohamed,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,- Basic knowledge of biomedical engineering - Good knowledge of linear algebra and mathematical analysis - Familiarity with the utilization/implementation of deep learning algorithms - Excellent programming skills (MATLAB; Python; etc.) - Self-motivation and ability to work independently.,
32259,Ecological stoichiometry modelling,Carbon (C); nitrogen (N); and phosphorus (P) are vital constituents in biomass: C supplies energy to cells; N is essential to build proteins; and P is an essential component of nucleic acids. The scarcity of any of these elements can severely restrict organism and population growth. Thus in nutrient deficient environments; the consideration of nutrient cycling; or stoichiometry; can be essential for population models. In this research project; we will construct mechanistic food web models that explicitly incorporate light and nutrient availability. Numerical simulations will be the main approach to uncover the dynamics of these stoichiometric models.,HAOWANG,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-07-01,Strong background in mathematical modelling and computer skills in using mathematical software packages (Matlab; Mathematica; or Maple) are required; and analytic skills (Advanced Calculus; Linear Algebra; Differential Equations) are preferred.,
32260,Analytic Methods in Extremal Combinatorics,One of the most influential recent developments in combinatorics is the emergence of a "limit theory" for combinatorial structures. The importance of combinatorial limit theory was recently recognized by the awarding of the Abel Prize to Lovasz (one of its inventors) in 2022. The basic idea behind it is that large combinatorial objects can be viewed as discrete approximation of a rich analytic structure (such as a measurable function). This viewpoint has led to new analytic tools for attacking important open problems in extremal combinatorics. The focus of this project will be on using methods from analysis; probability theory; optimization and information theory to attack problems in extremal combinatorics with connections to other areas. One focus will be on proving correlation inequalities for subgraph densities in large dense graphs related to the famous Sidorenko Conjecture on densities of bipartite graphs. These results are likely to shed light on the important problem of maximizing/minimizing partition functions in statistical physics. Another focus will be on finding new quantitative measures of independence for tuples of random variables. Through working on these projects; the student will be introduced to cutting-edge techniques in the area; such as the flag algebra method; applications of ideas from variational calculus and approaches based on analyzing the entropy of a random variable.,JonathanNoel,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in combinatorics and graph theory would be very valuable. The project will use techniques from other areas of mathematics and such as analysis; probability and information theory. Some familiarity with these areas would be an asset. The project will also require the student to write computer programs which will help to discover and prove new mathematical results. Therefore; it is important to have some computer programming skills. Familiarity with linear programming software and/or MATLAB would also be useful; but is not required.,
32261,Spatial modelling of animal movements,Animal movements and their underlying mechanisms are an extremely important research area in biology and have been extensively studied for centuries. To fully describe and understand animal movements is still challenging and needs substantial efforts in both empirical and theoretical studies.

32263,Multi-armed Bandit Models for RIS-aided Wireless Communications Systems,Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is one of the reinforcement learning problems that can be utilized for decision-making in which an agent tries to select actions (arms) to achieve the best cumulative reward in the long term. Many algorithms have been developed for MAB problems. One of the simplest of these is Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In this algorithm; Hoeffding's Inequality calculates the upper bound on the set of variables to have a better exploration-exploitation trade-off. This algorithm can be used to solve many wireless communications problems. As an example; beam alignment and tracking is an important problem in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless systems. Assume that there are several users in the network; each user has some features; and the agent should find the best beam angle for each user. So one can use MAB algorithms to blindly detect the beam directions. In other words; The approach should apply the exploration-exploitation trade-off for the selection of beam angles as fast as possible to outperform the search-based beam alignment methods; also the algorithm should learn the preferences of users by using the user's context information in bandits; and this type of algorithm is called Contextual Bandits. This research project deals with developing con textual bandit algorithms for beam alignment in RIS-aided wireless systems.,EkramHossain,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge on communications systems and wireless communications; and experience on Matlab programming.,Engg-Electrical
32264,Multi-armed Bandits for Integrated Communications and Sensing,Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is one of the reinforcement learning problems that can be utilized for decision-making in which an agent tries to select actions (arms) to achieve the best cumulative reward in the long term. Many algorithms have been developed for MAB problems. One of the simplest of these is Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) which can be used to solve many wireless communications problems. As an example; integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is an emerging technology for future 6G wireless systems. The basic principle of ISAC is to unify sensing and communications operations on a single hardware while using the same spectral resources. A special case of ISAC technology is joint radar-communications (JRC) system where sensing is performed by a radar. The research project will deal with developing algorithms for energy-efficient JRC systems under practical system constraints (e.g.; uncertainty in channel state).,EkramHossain,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge on communications systems and wireless communications; and experience on Matlab programming.,
32265,Multi-armed Bandits for Efficient Federated Learning,Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is one of the reinforcement learning problems that can be utilized for decision-making in which an agent tries to select actions (arms) to achieve the best cumulative reward in the long term. Many algorithms have been developed for MAB problems. One of the simplest of these is Upper Confidence Bound (UCB); which can be used to solve many wireless communications problems. As an example; consider a federated learning (FL) scenario in a network consisting of a base station (BS) (server) and a set of users (also referred to as clients). The server and the clients collaborate in training a shared model without sharing the clients' local data. In this learning algorithm; it is common to select a subset of clients to participate in the learning process rather using all of them for two main reasons. First; the number of communication channels between the clients and the server is limited and only a subset of clients would be able to communicate with the server. In addition to that; some clients can experience very long delay which; if included in the learning process; would slow the convergence of the algorithm. Note here that the delay experienced by each client is random due to the randomness in the channel conditions. The aim of this project to select a subset of clients that minimizes the FL convergence time without any prior knowledge about the state of the wireless channels or the clients. The proposed solution is based on combinatorial MABs where the clients represent the arms; and the learner; represented by the server; aims to find the super arm (subset of clients) that minimize the FL delay.,EkramHossain,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge on communications systems and wireless communications; and experience on Matlab programming,Engg-Electrical
32266,Historical Injustices in Higher Education Institutions,This is a SSHRC funded research project that focuses on the involvement of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in historical injustices. Despite the important role organizations play in cases of historical injustice; we still know little about how they produce; reproduce; and; eventually; also disrupt social injustices. On the one hand; organization scholars' interest in historical injustices is still recent and undeveloped. On the other hand; scholars of historical injustice have been inattentive to organizations supporting intergenerational harm. Further; both groups have particularly overlooked how organizations such as HEIs contribute to historical injustices. This project aims to fill the aforementioned gap by developing theory on how organizations promote the production; reproduction; and disruption of lasting social injustices such as racism; economic inequality; and class discrimination. We focus on how HEIs contribute with historical injustices because they are highly trusted organizations that provide institutional templates and set ethical standards for other public and private organizations. We also hope to identify strategies HEIs can employ to prevent continued structural injustices; reconcile past actions with inflicted harm; and disrupt legacies of wrongdoing. We aim to develop comparative case-study research of HEIs in three different countries. 1. Racial injustice in the United States. How do HEIs with ties to slavery (e.g.; Brown; Harvard) respond when challenged about their legacies of wrongdoing? 2. Ethnic injustice in Canada. How are Canadian HEIs indigenizing following the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action? 3. Class injustice in Brazil. How did a small group of HEIs manage to motivate the creation of a national affirmative policy for the democratization of higher education?,DiegoCoraiola,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,No skills available,American Studies; Business; Canadian Studies; Cultural Studies; Drama; English Literature; History; Humanities; Management; Medical Sciences; Native Studies; Political Science; Public Policy and Administration; Sociology
32268,Nanoparticle Enhanced Oils for New Fuel-Efficient Automotive Applications,Newly developed "conventional" automobiles will either contain stop-start engines or will rely on hybrid technology to reduce fuel consumption. These new technologies present issues for conventional oils; which typically need to operate at higher temperatures than would be achieved when the combustion engine runs intermittently. Thus; lower viscosity oils must be developed to ensure the same lubrication and wear performance of the oil in the internal combustion engine. Nanoparticles are seen as one solution to this problem; as their addition to conventional and synthetic oils has been observed to have beneficial lubrication and wear properties. Further enhancement of the lubrication and wear properties have been observed when these particles are coated in two-dimensional lubricants; such as graphene or boron nitride. However; in all cases; the nanoparticles need to be chemically capped such that they dissolve into the base stock oil. This project will examine the influence of polymer nanoparticles on the friction performance of conventional oils to determine the benefit of such particles to the lubrication performance of the oils; the fluid mechanical properties of the oil; and the wear performance. Comparison between conventional polymer nanoparticles and those covered in two-dimensional lubricants will be conducted; to determine any synergistic improvements that can be achieved in the friction and wear properties of the oil; as well as the ability for the two-dimensional films to improve the dissolution of the nanoparticles in the oil base stock. A particular emphasis on understanding the physical lubrication and wear mechanisms that are changed or altered through nanoparticle enhanced lubricants.,PhilipEgberts,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,The student should be highly motivated and interested in learning experimental techniques.

32269,Thermal activation of atomic friction,At the atomic length scale; friction does not follow the empirical rules. In particular; friction increases as temperature decreases and sliding speed increases. To continue to understand why this occurs and factors that impact the dependence of friction on temperature and sliding speed. We will build an experimental apparatus over the course of this project to be able to slide two surfaces quickly and resolve the atomic lattice structure while doing so. We will also be able to vary the temperature during friction measurements at high sliding speeds. The device must be built into the apparatus that allows for testing of samples in an ultra-high vacuum chamber; meaning all materials must be metals or ceramics.,PhilipEgberts,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,The student should be highly motivated and interested in learning experimental techniques.

32273,Optimization of Vibro-Compaction for Improved Green Anode Density for Aluminum Production: A fluid mechanics analysis,Canada is home to many premier aluminum smelters; including leading companies such as Alcoa; Rio Tinto Alcan; and Alouette; which rank among the largest of their kind globally. Despite the significance of aluminum production to the region; it is a complex process that incurs substantial energy consumption and environmental consequences. To mitigate these challenges; we will embark on an extensive study aimed at examining the effect of vibro-compaction on the density of green anodes used in aluminum production. Green anodes are typically fabricated by compacting anode paste in a mold through vibro-compaction. Nonetheless; this method remains only partially understood and is known to generate density gradients within the anodes that compromise cell performance. Previous research in this area is limited by several factors; including the lack of clarity in physical parameters and limited applicability to a range of anode paste recipes. Our study seeks to address these shortcomings by characterizing the mechanical behavior of anode paste during vibro-compaction at high frequencies (e.g.; 25 Hz) in a laboratory-scaled setting. We will study the process from a fluid mechanics perspective. To achieve our goal; we will employ a suite of advanced techniques including ultra-high-speed and laser imaging; tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV); Ultrasound Doppler velocimetry (UDV); and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to analyze the anode-forming process. These techniques will enable us to generate more uniform density distributions within green anodes and provide insights into the impact of anode geometry and recipe on the mechanical behavior of anode paste during vibro-compaction. Ultimately; the findings of this study will be used to optimize the process and reduce the environmental impact of aluminum production in Quebec.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,Physics; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Civil; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Petroleum; Engineering; Engg-Materials; Engg-Geological; Engg-Metallurgical; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Enviromental; Engg-Fuel; Engg-Industrial; Engg-Manufacturing; Engg-Mineral; Engg-Mining; Engg-Aeronautical; Engg-Biological; Engg-Biomedical; Engg-Ceramic; Engg-Computer; Engg-Software; Engg-Systems and Technology; English Literature
32274,Slippery When Yielded: Investigating the Flow of Yield Stress Fluids over Superhydrophobic Surfaces,Yield stress fluids are a class of non-Newtonian fluids that exhibit a threshold for applied stress; known as the yield stress. When the applied stress exceeds the yield stress; the material behaves like a viscous fluid; while below the yield stress; the material acts as a rigid solid. Examples of yield stress fluids include waxy crude oil; foamed cement and cement slurry; food products like chocolate cream and jam; and cosmetic products such as moisturizing cream. Superhydrophobic surfaces are surfaces that exhibit exceptional slipperiness when liquid flows over them; offering a range of new applications such as drag reduction and flow handling in microfluidic devices. The flow of yield stress fluids over superhydrophobic surfaces has current applications in the synthesis of biofluids in microfluidic devices and potential applications such as drag reduction for the flow of waxy crude oil through pipelines. This internship project aims to investigate the flow of yield stress fluids in channels lined with superhydrophobic walls. The primary objective is to characterize the slip property of the flow in contact with the wall; represented by a slip length. The flow configuration will be a pressure-driven channel flow; also known as Poiseuille flow; of yield stress fluids with superhydrophobic walls. The Herschel-Bulkley model will be used to model the yield stress fluid; and micro-scale groovy patterns will be created on the wall surface to fabricate the superhydrophobic wall; allowing the fluid to slip. Despite the potential for practical applications; there is a lack of research on the slip characteristics of non-Newtonian fluids over superhydrophobic surfaces. This project aims to fill this gap by employing mathematical modeling; numerical simulations; and experimental measurements to investigate the slip characteristics for the flow of yield stress fluids over superhydrophobic surfaces.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,Physics; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Civil; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Petroleum; Engineering; Engg-Materials; Engg-Geological; Engg-Metallurgical; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Enviromental; Engg-Fuel; Engg-Industrial; Engg-Manufacturing; Engg-Mineral; Engg-Mining; Engg-Aeronautical; Engg-Biological; Engg-Biomedical; Engg-Ceramic; Engg-Computer; Engg-Software; Engg-Systems and Technology; English Literature
32275,Novel lithium extraction processes from spodumene,Lithium extraction from spodumene concentrates is a complex process; which has remained largely unchanged since its inception in the 1940s. Nowadays; this process involves an energy-intensive flash-calcinination step of the spodumene concentrate to transform it from the alpha to the beta phase; prior to sulfuric acid baking. This flash-calcining typically uses fossil fuels (such as natural gas) as the source of energy; resulting in a significant carbon footprint for the production of the lithium hydroxyde used in Li-ion battery manufacturing. This project intends to test out spodumene extraction processes which do not involve flash-calcining of the spodumene; as a way to reduce the energy consumption. This may include: carbonate roasting of the spodumene; pressure leaching and reactions with alkali bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These methods typically present slower kinetics; which nonetheless must be studied in order to assess their applicability. As such; the project will involve: - a brief literature review highlighting the potential routes for Li extraction without flash-calcining and showing how they can be tested in the laboratory; - development of an apparatus and procedure for such Li extraction tests; - execution of tests and analyses allowing performance assessments; - establishing the feasibility (or not) of the proposed approaches and suggesting further research paths.,Jean-FrancoisBoulanger,Québec,Université du Québec en Abitibi–Temiscamingue,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Candidates self-identifying as women or from minority groups underrepresented in sciences; with a curriculum in chemical or metallurgical engineering or chemistry are strongly encouraged to apply; especially those with some knowledge of extractive metallurgy (hydrometallurgy) or mineral processing.

32277,Long-term responses of streams and riparian areas to forest harvesting,Forest harvesting around streams can have large; direct impacts. Some of the alterations to important processes; such as the amount of light reaching a stream; can recover quickly. However; other changes may take decades to recover; such as physical structure; including the amount of large wood in stream channels. Other changes to the forest composition (affecting organic matter inputs and chemistry) may also be slow to change. Most ecological studies consider only the short-term responses; usually at most a few years. In this study we have 15 stream catchments that had different magnitudes of forest harvesting almost 25 years ago; and we are considering how the intensity of harvesting affects recovery of biological communities and organic matter dynamics. This is a unique opportunity to study the long-term recovery of streams and their riparian areas from different amounts of protection from forest harvesting.,Dr. John S.RICHARDSON,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Undergraduate courses in ecology; and preferably freshwater ecology; will be important.

32278,Quantum computing for quantum chemistry,The electronic structure problem is the key for material and drug designs. Solving it accurately using quantum mechanical methods on regular classical computers leads to algorithms whose execution time grows exponentially with the system size. Emerging technology of quantum computing recently provided a new hope to solve this problem efficiently. Yet; the new quantum hardware requires new algorithms. Currently; there are two main algorithmic frameworks for solving the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer: 1) quantum phase estimation (QPE) and 2) variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). None of these approaches provide a solution to the problem that is competitive with well-developed numerical techniques on a classical computer. Thus; none of them has yet demonstrated quantum advantage (superiority of quantum computing over its classical counterpart) for the electronic structure problem. In this project we will be developing new alternative frameworks for solving the problem on a quantum computer that will address main deficiencies of the previous techniques. The main goal is to develop a framework demonstrating quantum advantage in quantum chemistry problems.,ArturIzmaylov,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Familiarity with quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry methods.,Chemistry; Computer Science; Physics
32279,Biodiversity of headwater streams,Biodiversity of invertebrate animals in small streams and their riparian areas is very high. The reasons for this high biodiversity and its maintenance are not known; but we are testing for the patterns and experimentally manipulating habitats to see if the abiotic factors that are associated with high biodiversity in these areas can be protected. In particular we are studying the contributions of small forested streams and ponds that are disproportionately impacted by climate change and land-use changes. We know relatively little about what maintains the freshwater biodiversity therein; because these areas are not directly used for human activities; including fishing and water withdrawals. This project will combine field surveys; transplant experiments and mesocosm experiments to address the diversity in these sites and their range of tolerance for changes in their environments related to climate change. This work provides for basic understanding of how these ecosystems function; the biodiversity they support; and how these systems respond to changes. This will contribute to practical outcomes; such as identifying features that need to be protected to sustain resilient and functioning freshwater ecosystems in the face of global changes.,Dr. John S.RICHARDSON,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,A student with a keen interest in ecology; and especially an interest in biodiversity and ecosystem function.

32285,Advancing Ink Formulations for Fabricating Durable Electrodes,The high cost of clean energy devices; such as hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers; are driven by the use of rare-earth metals; such as platinum; ruthenium; and iridium. These metal-based electrodes are conventionally fabricated through coating a catalyst ink on a substrate via blade coating or spray coating. The catalyst ink is formulated by mixing specific amounts of catalyst; alcohols; binders; and water; and the ink properties are highly sensitive to mixing ratios and parameters. Non-ideal ink formulation leads to formation of cracks during electrode deposition; which leads to poor durability of the clean energy devices. Thus; understanding the relationship between the ink formulation parameters and the resulting electrode property is critical to creating efficient and durable clean energy devices. In this project; we will investigate how the ink recipe affects crack formation after ink deposition. We will vary the volume ratio of alcohol and water; binder content; and electrode thickness; and we will characterize the resulting ink properties. The inks will be deposited to a substrate to form an electrode; which we will image under an optical microscope. We will use image analysis techniques to characterize the crack morphology and density. The results of this work will provide fundamental understanding of ink formulation effects on electrode structure.,ChungHyukLee,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-13,We are an energetic and interdisciplinary lab; and we are looking for an independent and hardworking student to join our lab.

32286,Designing Next Generation Electrodes for Clean Energy Applications,The high cost of hydrogen-based clean energy devices; such as hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers; are driven by the use of rare-earth metals; such as platinum; ruthenium; and iridium; in the electrodes. These metal-based electrodes are often fabricated through conventional coating processes; such as roll-to-roll coating; blade coating; and spray coating; which leads to under-utilized catalysts and loss in efficiency. Identifying and using controlled electrode fabrication methods can lead to improved utilization of rare-earth metals and thus affordable energy devices. In this project; we will use microfabrication techniques to fabricate unique electrode structures. We will combine compression molding and photolithography to realize 3D structures with tailored transport properties. Through validating the structure via microscopy techniques; the electrode structure will be optimized. The project will produce a robust platform for enabling novel electrode designs that will ultimately contribute to more affordable clean energy devices.,ChungHyukLee,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-13,We are an energetic and interdisciplinary lab; and we are looking for an independent and hardworking student to join our lab.

32287,Vision-Based Techniques for Automated Robot Control and Inspection,Industrial robotic arms are widely used in the aerospace manufacturing industry to perform operations such as trimming; drilling; and abrasion of composite panels. The dimensional accuracy and surface quality of machined parts must meet the strict tolerance requirements of the aerospace industry. Currently; inspection of some machined parts is carried out manually; which is time-consuming and unreliable. Faulty parts not detected during the inspection process can later lead to failure of aircraft components; downtime; and in extreme cases; loss of lives. The long-term goal of this research is to develop computer vision techniques to inspect the dimensional accuracy and surface quality of machined parts; e.g. aerospace composite panels; intelligently without a need for human intervention. This goal will be achieved by utilizing high-resolution cameras combined with advanced image processing; computer vision; and deep learning algorithms.

32295,Discovering the secrets of axenic boxes to study plant-microbe interactions,As we face an acceleration of global change: increasing temperatures; humidity and CO2 levels accompanied with higher demands on land for mining and agriculture; there is a need to improve our understanding of plant-microbe interactions. To isolate causal mechanisms of interactions between host and microbes; researchers have sought to work with axenic plant hosts: plants that would grow devoid of any microorganism. This task is proving to be challenging; has fungal and bacterial spores get everywhere; such as viruses. The field of plant-microbe interactions has seen the development of axenic boxes that are meant to allow researchers to grow Arabidopsis thaliana without any microorganisms. This system is currently being used although some environmental components are far from representative of real-life environment (>99% humidity); thus favouring pathogens and eliciting a weird plant phenotype (smaller plants). In this project; we are developing a novel system that allows us to grow A. thaliana to a wild-type-like phenotype which we can then inoculate with specific microbes that are known to be symbionts or pathogens. In your contribution to this projection; you will have the opportunity to grow A. thaliana in our novel axenic system and control specific abiotic (humidity; heat; nutrients) and biotic (select specific bacterial or fungal strains to be inoculated) conditions to measure their impact on the plant growth; survival; and immune system.

32297,Community translation and interpretation services,Community translation (also known as public service translation) is under-researched. It is also poorly recognized as a profession. However; it has been practiced ever since immigrants move from one language space to another. So there is a need for community translation research. The current project is about improving the quality of community translation in Canada; starting with the services offered by settlement agencies so that newcomers are well-served and can better engage in their host society. In Canada; settlement agencies support new comers in their integration. They do receive the support of professional and volunteer translators to communicate with their clients. There are however important discrepancies from one agency to the other. My goal is to highlight the differences in the services offered by the agencies to the immigrants; and to suggest models that could help improve service quality in terms of language quality and service available. In order to do so; the project will include different phases: 1) Analysing documentation and/or interviewing settlement agencies to understand how each one proceeds to support immigrants; 2) Elaborate a profile of community translators in Canada; 3) Describe gaps between different types of services 4) Sketch a model protocol that would allow to offer uniform translation services.,AnneBeinchet,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Curious and autonomous Knowledgeable in intercultural issues Previous exposition to Translation Studies Experience in literature review Experience in quantitative data analysis is a plus Experience in qualitative data analysis is a plus,Cultural Studies; Humanities; Language Studies; Modern Languages; Spanish Language; Translation; French Studies; Hispanic Studies

32303,Transforming Wonder: Justice in Old and New Fairy-Tale Media,Fairy-Tale Justice in Old and New Media: Transforming Wonder links scholars from Canada; India; Netherlands; and US to address fairy tales’ expressions on film and television; and in other audiovisual media; their uses (e.g. in fan cultures and fan fiction); and their transnational; postcolonial; and de-colonial manifestations in terms of their morality and concepts of crime and justice; among other crucial aspects. We locate and explore links between these aspects; combining the team members’ different multidisciplinary approaches and methods to understand the real-world work of fairy tales envisioning justice in valuable new ways. Fairy tales include literary stories by an individual author (e.g. Hans Christian Andersen) and traditional narratives--international; historical Märchen or tales of magic. Both types intertextually and intermedially relate to earlier and later manifestations; translated into different languages; cultural contexts; forms; and media. Influencing analyses well beyond literary studies; and filtered through tale collectors from at least the second century AD; Märchen; like literary fairy tales; deal with the supernatural--magical adversaries; tasks; helpers; objects; power; and knowledge. Our work has two phases: Phase 1: Justice in intertextual; intermedial fairy-tales and wonder: embodiments; and Phase 2: Justice in intertextual; intermedial fairy-tales and wonder: transnational; transcultural chronotopes. We examine how creators and audiences employ fairy-tale structures and motifs as social texts (implicated in specific cultural contexts) to tell the same (or different) stories. Key scholars like Maria Tatar; Marina Warner; and team member Jack Zipes argue; based on historical and current fairy tales; that the genre expresses realistic sociocultural concerns and fears; marshals a symbolic vocabulary of imagination and possibility; and demonstrates both social constraints like patriarchy and classism and resistance to and triumph over these limitations. Fairy tales' serious societal work of imagining just alternatives calls for serious scholarly attention.,PaulineGreenhill,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-01,We seek a student with some background in gender; queer; anti-racist; de-colonial studies and perspectives; with interest in and enthusiasm for fairy-tale media. They must demonstrate excellence in research methodology and other courses; show scholarly maturity; have topical knowledge; and express interest in graduate studies. The student must be able to work without extensive direct supervision; once they are initiated into the research project; but they must also know when it is appropriate to ask questions and consult. Ideally; knowledge and facility in languages other than English would be a great asset.,
32305,BRM-related gene expression patterns in human abdominal cavity tumors s,The protein product of the BRM gene is a subunit of an important protein complex called SWI/SNF. This complex is involved in remodeling our DNA molecule and influencing gene expression. There are many published studies linking abnormalities of this gene to cancer; including risk of developing cancer (for example; lung cancer) and patient outcomes (for example; death from cancer). We previously examined this gene in colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinomas. In this study; we aim to examine the gene expression levels of this gene in human tumors – preferably in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for the gastrointestinal cancers (e.g. stomach; esophageal) and other cancers originating in the abdominal cavity. We hypothesize that the expression levels of BRM differ between tumors of different patients. We also hypothesize that this difference is associated with different expression levels of other genes and biological pathways. By analyzing the differentially expressed genes/biological pathways and the disease and patient characteristics; we hope to find out how BRM expression levels are linked to this disease biologically. Cancer is a common disease. Understanding the relation of BRM to human cancers may create exciting opportunities for future studies. Since the BRM gene is linked to multiple human cancers; we expect that this study may also significantly contribute to our understanding of many cancers at the biological level. We can focus on cancers with the largest sample sizes in the TCGA dataset; such as stomach and esophageal cancers; but other abdominal cancer sites are also great candidates.,SevtapSavas,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-01,The study will include the gene expression data provided by public resources; such as the TCGA project. The data analysis will require computational investigations; such as identification of differentially expressed genes; pathway analyses; and application of statistical methods. A strong computational background in retrieval; management; formatting; and analysis of large-scale biological data is required. Writing codes may also be required. Since many gene expression analysis tools have established R packages that can used in this project; a knowledge of R-environment may be necessary. Training for statistical analysis will be provided.,Computer Science; Genetics; Health Studies
32306,Palmitoylation-dependent protein trafficking in neurons,Neurons are the basic working unit of the brain. They transmit information from other neurons or sensory organs to downstream neurons or muscles and; in doing so; control learning and memory; movement; and other complex tasks. Neurons are large; complex cells with long projections; called axons; that send electrical impulses to other neurons they are connected to. Ion channels are proteins that open and close to form pores in the outer fatty layer of the neuron known as the membrane. They initiate and carry electrical impulses along axons and must be delivered to specific locations in the axon to ensure normal brain function. These ion channels are modified with a sticky tag in a process called palmitoylation. The sticky tag acts like a postal code that helps other cell machinery transport the ion channels to the correct location. We hypothesize that palmitoylation directs ion channels and retains them at the sites where electrical impulses are generated. This project seeks to understand how palmitoylation regulates ion channel and organelle trafficking and targeting in neurons. The student will get to clone palmitoylated neuronal proteins and expressing them in mammalian cells grown in culture to identify their sites of palmitoylation and the enzymes that regulate this process. The student will then get to express fluorescently tagged wild type ('normal') palmitoylated proteins and their palmitoylation deficient counterparts in neurons and monitor their localization. This project will provide the student with a broad array of laboratory skills in molecular biology; cell biology; and biochemistry. This work will provide new insights into the regulation of transport of cellular components in brain cells and a better understanding of their normal function. Our findings will also have important implications for understanding disorders such as epilepsy; where there is too much brain electrical activity.,ShaunSanders,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-13,The student will have completed at least two years of a neuroscience; biology; or related undergraduate program and will have taken classes on cell biology; neuroscience; and molecular biology.

32309,Cellular foci of the androgen receptor and their role in prostate cancer,The androgen receptor (AR) remains the main target for Prostate Cancer (PCa) treatment. Unfortunately; most AR antagonists fail due to resistance mechanisms; highlighting the need for new approaches to target this receptor. Lately; condensates of transcription factors and coactivators have been shown to form at super-enhancers (SEs); which are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble the transcriptional apparatus at high density in order to enable the robust expression of genes that play an important role in defining cell identity. It has been established that cancer cells; including PCa; rely on abnormal transcription programs driven by SEs. Our preliminary data demonstrate that AR-rich condensates form in PCa models upon androgen stimulation and control its transcriptional activity. In this study; we will use a multi-disciplinary approach including biophysics; genomics; biochemistry; and cell biology to characterize the biophysical properties of AR condensates; to identify sequence features and partners essential for this mechanism; and to elucidate the effect of cancerous environment on AR condensate formation at SE sites. This research study will help to identify novel ways of targeting AR activity downstream of androgen activation and DNA binding.,NadaLallous,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The project involves cell culture; protein biochemistry; and microscopy skills.

32313,Dynamic Stability of Structures with Semi-Rigid Connections,Neglect or poor understanding of the effect of dynamic (time-varying) loads on the resonance and stability aspects of structural design may cause loss of property or other disasters. For example; the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed in 1940 due to aerodynamic instability; a pillar rockburst was induced in underground excavations at the Musselwhite mine in Ontario in 2015; and piled tanks collapsed after the 2017 Mexico earthquake. How to accurately and effectively assess and predict such failures is a key issue in civil engineering. Dynamic loadings arising from earthquakes; winds; or blasting often consist of forces with various wave shapes and would appear as one of the coefficients in the governing equations of motion. Such systems are said to be parametrically excited and the associated instability is called parametric resonance. Parametric resonance is more dangerous than ordinary resonance—characterized by linear growth of the response amplitude—because it is characterized by exponential growth of the response amplitude; even in the presence of damping. The objective of the project is to theoretically and experimentally study parametric resonance and dynamic stability of structures subjected to dynamic loads with various waveforms; with applications to civil and mining engineering. We will develop efficient analytical and numerical methods to determine dynamic stability of various systems.

In this project; the dynamic stability of an elastic prismatic slender column pillar with semi-rigid connections at both ends subject to parametric axial loads will be investigated. The dynamic load on the pillar will be fully analyzed. A differential equation of motion is set up to characterize the dynamic behavior of the pillar. An advanced algorithm will be proposed to solve the differential equation. Therefore; fundamental analytical and experimental skills would be a requirement.,
32314,Landslides investigation, risk evaluation and mitigation in Northwestern Ontario, Canada,The Nipigon river area in Ontario; Canada is in a dynamic geological zone often affected by soil slope failures; landslides; debris flows and rock falls. A typical example is the massive landslide that occurred in the 1990s; which involved an estimated 300;000 cubic meters of soil and extended almost 350m inshore with a maximum width of approximately 290m. It caused significant economic loss and environmental impacts. Since then; progressive landslides along the river banks have occurred from time to time. The overall purpose of the research project is to conduct in-situ soil investigations; to perform laboratory testing; and to carry out risk analysis of landslides in the Nipigon river area. We will obtain representative soil samples from bored holes of all relevant layers. By using the advanced triaxial test apparatus in the soil lab of Lakehead University; triaxial shear tests will be conducted to determine a series of soil shear strength parameters. This data will be used to develop new entropy-based probabilistic models in the risk and stability analysis of geotechnical slopes. Measures to mitigate the landslide hazard will be proposed. This project will carefully study the soil properties and assess the stability of natural and artificial slopes such that we have a good engineering practice and society lives in a safe environment.

32317,Unpacking the Interdisciplinary Commitment of the Team and Disruption of their Research,Work in knowledge-intensive and innovative organizations is often structured around teams. Organizing teams to increase the likelihood of disruption poses a significant challenge. In organizational research; disruption occurs when smaller firms challenge established incumbent firms; which focus on sustaining innovations and improving products and services for their most profitable customers (Christensen; 1997; Christensen; Raynor; & McDonald; 2015). Similarly; scholarly work that is disruptive broadens academic perspectives and eclipses previous studies that build on existing conceptualizations; whereas studies that are developing incrementally enhance or reinforce past research directions (Funk & Owen-Smith; 2017). The effects different team-level organizational arrangements - their size; mix of skills and knowledge; and diversity– have on disruptive outcomes are rarely tested (Haeussler & Sauermann; 2020; Wang et al.; 2017; 2018). We begin to tease out how differences in the organization of tens of thousands of scientific teams working in the full range of science and social science research fields influence the type of research that they produce. We aim to answer the research questions: Where does disruptive research come from? How does the interdisciplinarity commitment of the team impact the disruptiveness of their research? While there is substantive evidence that scientists who are engaged in interdisciplinary research benefit from higher visibility and impact (Leahey et al.; 2017; Uzzi et al.; 2013) and facilitate their researcher’s engagement in technology transfer (D’Este et al.; 2019); less is known about whether a team’s interdisciplinarity impacts disruptiveness of the team's research work. Interdisciplinarity is often considered valuable in itself because: (a) it increases variety in research; potentially counteracting the increasing tendency toward specialization in many fields (Cedrini & Fontana; 2017); and (b) it promotes the broad search for adequate solutions to various scientific and social problems (Rafols et al.; 2012; Wang et al.; 2017).,NazhaGali,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-07-01,The student needs to know SQL and to deal with big data and in using Python.,Computer Science
32318,Research on Self-Tapping-Wood-Screws,There is an acute need for research to develop value-added applications for wood and wood products such as Cross-Laminated-Timber (CLT). One prominent target area are mid- and high-rise structures. In seismic regions; such as Western Canada; connectors must provide ductility to otherwise rigid building systems composed of CLT panels. There are a number of options available; one of the most promising are Self-Tapping-Screws (STS). The objective of the project is to develop design guidance for CLT assemblies connected by STS for large structures; considering seismic loads. Experimental; numerical and analytical work on the material; component and system levels will be combined to achieve this objective. The project can contribute to increasing the market share of wood products in the North American construction sector; and thus; the project contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of structures.,ThomasTannert,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,The applicants should study for a degree in either civil engineering; wood science; or mechanical engineering.

32319,Experimental investigations on reinforced timber elements,The last decades were marked by a significant widening in the range of structural application of timber. There is; however; a growing need for the maintenance and upgrading of existing buildings for economic; environmental; historical and social concerns. Worldwide; a large proportion of the existing building stock is more than 50 years old; many of these buildings need to be adapted for more sophisticated present and future requirements. The need for structural reinforcement of timber buildings may become necessary from motivations such as change of use; changes in regulatory specifications; interventions to increase seismic resistance; deterioration due to poor maintenance; or exceptional damaging incidents. One method to reinforce timber is adding elements to increase strength and stiffness; the options range from mechanical fasteners like glued-in rods and self-tapping screws; adhesive systems; steel straps and plates; ever more widely fibre-reinforced polymers; and most recently nanotechnology. In the project; timber elements with mechanical reinforcements will be investigated considering a wide range of parameters. A statistically significant number of specimens will be tested; herein 10 for each parameter combination. The load-deformation behaviour in a selected subset of tests will be monitored; with special focus close and beyond failure.,ThomasTannert,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,The intern should have a background in either civil engineering; materials science; or a related field.

32320,Mapping Access and Use of Public Transit,The research project will be spatial-analytic. It will involve mapping (ArcGIS Pro and related Geographic Information Systems software); analysis (General Transit Feed System data and GIS); and interpretation of spatial and transit data. While students with a technical background and training are encouraged to apply; we anticipate working with students that have a subset of targeted skills and may need additional training in other area. The three phases of the project are: 1. Access; download; explore; and present spatial data from the Canada Census and GTFS sources. Several maps will be produced to provide baseline patterns. Additional analysis will be conducted to associate the existing and future (BRT) Transit infrastructure. By integrating GTFS and Census we will be able to draw conclusions regarding the socio-economic; socio-cultural; and immigration impacts of the proposed transit services. 2. The GTFS data will be used to establish the spatial impact of the BRT services. 3.

32321,Deep learning-based Control,Batteries are flexible assets that can help modulate power loads at multiple timescales. From the battery perspective; determining an optimal amount of frequency regulation (FR) capacity to be offered in the market is a non-trivial task. This involves a complex multiscale decision-making problem to be solved every hour; in which the stationary battery systems need to exploit high-fidelity models to trade-off short-term economic incentives provided by frequency regulation markets and long-term degradation effects. The computational complexity of solving this large-scale nonlinear optimization problem is challenging for online implementation. To address the challenges; we aim to replace the online optimization with a well-trained neural network controller. We will first generate a big data set by solving many optimization problems off-line in parallel with different signals. Then a deep learning model can be trained to predict the optimal control actions from states and disturbances. The student will develop in-depth knowledge of nonlinear optimization; mathematical analysis; scientific programming; and deep learning. Successful completion of the project will lead to a publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.,YankaiCao,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-15,mathematical analysis; scientific programming,
32322,A Machine Learning Approach to Optimize a New Biomass-Based Carbon Removal Processes,A promising way to capture/remove carbon profitably is through the conversion of crop/forest residues (biomass) into bioproducts such as biochar-based fertilizers and chemicals. However; most rural communities are shut out from this bio-based economy; because their crop/forest residues are often loose; wet; bulky; and too expensive to transport to a centralized place. These non-merchantable residues are often burned in open air; leading to pollution and exacerbated wildfires. We have implemented a new class of small-scale; low-cost; decentralized bioconversion systems. These can be latched onto the back of tractors/pick-up trucks to deploy to remote; hard-to-access communities to locally upgrade/densify the residues into locally valuable chemicals; biofuels; or fertilizers without external energy input. However; the key barrier for scaling this technology is that we do not yet know how to precisely control the complex behaviors of the reaction processes; and how to quantify the effects of various parameters. In this project; we apply machine learning to optimize the reactor/bioproduct performance in different contexts and track/quantify carbon removed; using one of the largest and most diverse datasets ever reported; generated under realistic field-like conditions. Our models can be generalized to other biomass-based carbon removal pathways. Our ultimate vision is to develop an automated; real-time strategy to coordinate/scale a fleet of decentralized reactors deployed in the field; and to customize the conversion of bioproducts tailored to local communities’ needs. When scaled globally; this will help mitigate more than a gigaton/year CO2-equivalent at full potential.,YankaiCao,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-15,mathematical analysis; scientific programming,
32323,Developing Global Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning,For most machine learning problems; the dominant methods in practice are based on either heuristics or local optimization algorithms; producing sub-optimal solutions. The prevailing belief in the machine learning community is that global optimization is not necessary and not practically relevant for large datasets. In this project; we will focus on two fundamental machine learning tasks; centroid-based clustering and decision tree. We have developed a global optimization algorithm for these tasks based on a reduced-space spatial branch and bound scheme. This algorithm can guarantee convergence to the global optimum by only branching on the model parameters; whose size is independent of the dataset’s cardinality. Notably; our algorithm can address datasets with millions of samples (i.e.; 1000 times larger than the state-of-the-art methods in the literature). Our group has published many papers in high-impact journals and conferences; including the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML); Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS); Journal of Global Optimization; and Automatica. The student is expected to continue the development of scalable algorithms and perform numerical tests on extensive datasets. The student will develop in-depth knowledge of nonlinear optimization; mathematical analysis; scientific programming; and deep learning. Successful completion of the project will lead to a publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.,YankaiCao,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-15,mathematical analysis; scientific programming,Engineering; Computer Science
32324,Internet of Things Secure Protocols,The basic concept behind the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) is to connect as many objects to the Internet as possible in an attempt to make our lives better in some way. However; connecting everyday objects like your car or house to the Internet can open up major security concerns. Our project focuses on creating and developing novel security frameworks for the Message Queue Transport Telemetry (MQTT) protocol based on publish/subscribe messages in order to enhance secure and privacy-friendly Internet of Things services. We may also if there is interest look at other IoT protocols like CoAP and Zigbee. MQTT has burst onto the IoT scene in recent years due to its lightweight design and ease of use and implementation that is necessary for IoT. MQTT came into the limelight for its use with Facebook Messenger and its direct links to IoT. What makes MQTT popular is its light footprint on both energy and computation. Where it is lacking; however; is in robust security. Although there is some level of security available for MQTT; it does not meet the high threshold needed for the future of IoT. Moreover; the security available does not have the efficiency in both energy and computational that is required. This project will focus on trying to develop security frameworks that will withstand the needs of IoT based solutions employing MQTT. It will involve design; framework; provable security; and finally programming; testing; and implementation of the Protocol itself. We have already published some preliminary work in this field in high impact venues and wish to continue the work further into 2023.,GautamSrivastava,Manitoba,Brandon University,English,2024-05-06,The student will need some exposure to Cryptography (potentially Quantum Cryptography) or basic understanding of cryptography.

32325,Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things,This project will attempt to better understand the limitations and challenges of Blockchain technology being applied to Internet of Things (IoT). For better or for worse; the propagation of Bitcoin-like currencies has shifted the focus of many towards a completely digital financial world. If we can slowly remove the layers of Bitcoin; we see a shining diamond at the core in the form of blockchain technology. The main observation to be made about blockchains is their ability to be used outside of the financial world; possibly re-inventing the way we handle many different applications of our day to day lives. However; one aspect that works well for Bitcoin and other digital currencies will most likely fall flat in other scenarios. The consensus scheme used by Bitcoin to confirm transactions is reward based and is not energy efficient. This research proposal looks at solving this shortcoming of blockchain technology and tries to further the application base of it. This project will look to fully identify and understand the limitations and shortcomings of blockchain technology. Furthermore; this project will aim to develop some sort of hybrid consensus scheme; that not only uses the positive aspects of current blockchain technology; but also taps into some of the classical consensus scheme architectures that date back to the early days of Computer Science.,GautamSrivastava,Manitoba,Brandon University,English,2024-05-06,The student will need some exposure to Blockchain or basic understanding of blockchain technology and consensus protocols.

32326,Federated Learning for the Internet of Things,The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally; AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications; by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this research project; we will dive into the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks; beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly; we will explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services; including IoT data sharing; data offloading and caching; attack detection; localization; mobile crowdsensing; and IoT privacy and security. We will focus on one area of use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare; smart transportation; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); smart cities; and smart industry. The important lessons learned from this research project of the FL-IoT services and applications will make for interesting extensions if the student wishes to pursue further education (MSc and PhD).,GautamSrivastava,Manitoba,Brandon University,English,2024-05-06,The student will need some exposure to Artificial Intelligence and Federated Learning or a basic understanding of Artificial Intelligence .

32327,Glycerol Hydrogenolysis,In order to increase the conversion of the process and to improve the selectivity towards 1;3-propanediol; different catalysts will be prepared by different synthetic routes. These catalysts will then be tested in a batch reactor; and will be characterized by different analytical techniques (XRD; TEM; TPR...). The reaction will be studied by varying different parameters in the catalyst production to test which properties must be taken into account to achieve a high selectivity and conversion. We are interested in producing nanostructures that allow a selective rupture of the intermediate -OH group of glycerol. A research is needed to design the catalyst and its synthesis. Then it will be produced in the laboratory. The next step will be the characterization of the catalyst and finally its testing under different reaction conditions. After testing; the data will be analyzed to have a better understanding of the reaction and its changes with different catalysts. The student will work with a PhD student in each part of the process. This will help the student understand the importance of each step in the process.,FedericoGalli,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-05-06,We require knowledge of heterogeneous catalysis; inorganic materials synthesis; organic chemistry; thermodynamics and kinetics; chemical engineering and process development.

32328,Blue hydrogen from methane to reduce emissions,The long-term objective long-term objectives (10-20y) of the research program is decarbonize the oil and gas industry through innovations in process engineering. Also other sources of non-fossil methane are target of the innovation proposed. Methane thermally or catalytically decomposes into solid carbon and hydrogen (CH4 → C +2 H2); with no emissions of greenhouse gases. However; coking is a great impediment to the development of small-scale pyrolysis. Web Of Science indexes 3828 articles published after 2018 using the keyword natural gas pyrolysis. These articles focus on fast pyrolysis for hydrogen and olefin production (2018) and on modeling and fast pyrolysis for biomass (cellulose and lignin) treatment. Little information is available concerning long residence time (high hydrocarbon conversion) pyrolysis as coking clogs the reactor; which is normally a plug flow fixed bed type reactor. Wang et al. found a correlation between gas temperature and coke structure but did not go into more depth because their work was focused on ceramic fillers; and they limited the time on stream to 240 min. The whole process results in the net production of solid carbon,FedericoGalli,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-13,Basic chemistry (very basic); work with common analytical techniques (GC; IR); understanding of process modelling,
32330,Viral regulation of chromatin,ICP4 is the only essential HSV1 transcription activator. It is therefore absolutely critical for the successful takeover of the host cell and the production of progeny HSV1 virions. We have identified that ICP4 destabilizes chromatin by increasing the chromatin exchange of histones (histone dynamics). The regulation of histone dynamics is a novel activity for a viral protein that has never been described before. How ICP4 regulates histone dynamics is not known. It is also now known how ICP4- regulation of histone dynamics relates to its mechanisms to activate HSV1 gene expression. As a first step to characterize how ICP4 regulates histone dynamics; we aim to identify ICP4-interacting proteins using proximity ligation (BioID). This method uses a biotin ligase (BirA) fused to the protein of interest to biotinylate proteins within a small distance from the protein of interest. The biotinylated proteins are then purified; identified by mass spectrometry; and tested for their functional roles. This method will enable the identification of proteins that directly; indirectly; or transiently interact with ICP4; and it has never before been used for ICP4. By identifying what nuclear proteins interact with ICP4; we can test their functional relevance for ICP4 regulation of histone dynamics and begin to characterize this activity and how it relates to HSV1 nuclear takeover.,KristenConn,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic knowledge in the areas of cell biology and microbiology with some experience in common molecular biology techniques; including micropipetting.

32331,Chromatin dynamics during Equine herpesvirus infection,Equine herpesvirus (EHV1) is common throughout horse populations worldwide. EHV1 establishes a life-long infection that is largely asymptomatic. However; symptomatic disease manifestations can be severe and include neurological or respiratory disease; abortion; and even neonatal death. More knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of EHV1 infection is necessary to inform the development of new strategies to treat or prevent EHV1-associated diseases. We will use knowledge of the closely related alphaherpesvirus; herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1); to guide our characterization of the molecular mechanisms that regulate EHV1 chromatin and investigate how chromatin regulates EHV1 infection. Lytic HSV1 genomes are assembled into highly dynamic; transcriptionally competent; chromatin. Consistent with the highly dynamic HSV1 chromatin; HSV1 transcription activators destabilize chromatin by increasing the chromatin exchange of histones (histone dynamics). Alteration of histone dynamics is a novel consequence of viral infection. It is not known if this phenomenon is specific to HSV1 or if it is a conserved feature among alphaherpesviruses. To this end; we aim to evaluate EHV1 chromatin dynamics. We aim to test the stability of EHV1 chromatin using standard molecular biology assays. We will also directly evaluate histone dynamics in live EHV1-infected cells.,KristenConn,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic knowledge in the areas of cell biology and molecular biology with some experience in common molecular biology techniques; including micropipetting.

32332,Viral transcription factor dynamics,Chromatin regulates gene expression by regulating the access of the transcription machinery to the DNA. Gaining (and maintaining) access to DNA that is assembled in chromatin is a critical step for transcription. How ICP4-regulates transcription of HSV1 genes assembled in chromatin is not yet fully understood. The ICP4 DNA-binding domain binds to sequence-specific DNA sites. However; binding to DNA is generally considered non-essential for ICP4 to activate transcription. Instead; current models propose that ICP4 interacts with other cellular transcription factors and transcription co-activator proteins to bridge the promoter and terminator elements of ICP4-regulated genes. This “gene-looping” mechanism is suggested to increase the rate of RNA polymerase recycling onto ICP4-regulated gene promoters. This model suggests that ICP4 is stably located at ICP4-regulated gene promoters to establish and maintain the “gene loop”. Unfortunately; this model does not consider how ICP4 or other cellular transcription factors access the regulatory elements of ICP4-regulated genes in the presence of viral chromatin. To further our understanding of ICP4-regulated transcription; we aim to evaluate the nuclear mobility of ICP4 in live cells. If ICP4 stably binds to DNA (or chromatin) with high affinity; it would be expected to have slower nuclear mobility than if it engages in low-affinity binding events. The observed mobility of ICP4 will be related to the described mobilities of cellular transcription factors with well-characterized transcription regulation mechanisms (such as FoxA and Sox9). This information will increase our knowledge of ICP4 functions to enable further testing of the proposed model for ICP4-regulated transcription and support characterization of the mechanisms to overcome the chromatin barrier to access ICP4-regulated genes.,KristenConn,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic knowledge in the areas of cell biology and microbiology with some experience in common molecular biology techniques; including micropipetting.

32334,Characterizing soil hydraulic properties after exposure to dry-wet cycles,Experiment 1 will examine the effect of initial soil moisture content (25% of field capacity [FC]; 50% of FC; 75% of FC; and 100% FC) and soil texture (sand/loamy sand; clay loam & sandy loam) on soil physical properties including bulk density; aggregate stability; saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; and pore size distribution. The experiment will be laid out in a completely randomized design. Soil will be packed into sampling rings to a bulk density of 1.1 g cm-3 and kept at the initial moisture contents indicated above for the measurement of hydraulic properties. Units will be subjected to 10 DWCs with a 2-day dry period (30°C) in an incubator and a 1-day wet period (21°C). For the wet period; water will be added to units to attain original moisture content as indicated above. Control units kept at 21°C for the duration of the DWCs will be included for comparison. After DWCs; the unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity; bulk density; water retention properties at field capacity (20 kPa) and permanent wilting point (PWP) (1500 kPa); and aggregate stability will be measured using standard methods. Experiment 2 will build on experiment 1 with a similar set up using only 2 initial moisture content (25% and 75% of FC) to elucidate the impact of organic amendment on soil hydraulic properties in soils subjected to DWCs. Experimental units will consist of soils thoroughly mixed with organic amendments (no manure; liquid; and solid swine manure) packed as described above and subject to similar DWCs. After DWCs; similar measurements as in experiment 1 will be conducted.

32335,Synthesis and characterization of high-temperature superconductor thin films,New superconductors could have a tremendous impact on our society; for example by increasing the efficiency of energy storage and transport as global consumption continues to grow; or by providing the basis for next-generation quantum computers; to name only a few. In this research; our main goals are to grow atomic layers of new superconductors; increase their transition temperatures; and help shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Among the different families of new superconducting materials; we are focusing on iron-based materials in thin film forms; where superconductivity in single atomic layers was only discovered a few years ago. No one had imagined that an iron-based material could be a superconductor because of iron’s famous magnetic properties since the conventional wisdom said that magnetic moments would destroy superconductivity. Instead; the iron-based superconductors have a relatively simple structure and exhibit a surprisingly high transition temperature. Small changes to the crystal structure and substitution of some atoms with different elements have pushed the transition temperature even higher; and no one knows yet what the limits are.,KeZou,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-31,We use chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for the synthesis of superconducting materials. CVD and MBE are film deposition techniques widely used for mass production of devices and circuits in the microelectronics industry that relies on controlled chemical reactions to produce the desired crystal. In addition; in CVD or MBE we can easily change the substrate or add a variety of materials to modify the conditions of growth that allow us to control the resulting film properties. Any related background in physics; chemistry; and materials science are welcome.,
32336,Fracture detection from wrist ultrasound images using Deep Learning,The overall objective of this project is to develop a tool that can detect fractures of the wrist and elbow from ultrasound video sequences. Multiple clinical studies; including research conducted by our group; have established the potential of ultrasound as an alternative to X-rays for fracture detection. However; the key limitation to using ultrasound in clinical practice is the difficulty of interpreting ultrasound images. To address this limitation; we aim to develop AI tools that can automatically assess the image quality of musculoskeletal ultrasound images acquired by lightly trained users and provide a suggestive diagnosis for the image acquired. We have developed deep learning techniques to segment various parts of the wrist and elbow using supervised learning. However; acquiring large numbers of precise pixel-wise labels for ultrasound images is tedious; time-consuming; and prohibitively expensive. Therefore; this internship will focus on developing minimally supervised learning(MSL) techniques that can be used to train AI models on image-level labels; which are much easier to obtain.,AbhilashRakkunedeth Hareendranathan,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a background in Machine Learning and Computational Methods; as well as hands-on experience in Python programming and familiarity with commonly used machine learning libraries like Pytorch.

32337,Creating Digital Twin Models of University Buildings,The rapid pace of technological advancements in recent years has presented both challenges and opportunities for universities. The Campus Digital Transformation Initiative (CDTI) aims to capitalize on these opportunities by leveraging innovative digital technologies to streamline the management of campus assets. Through the utilization of data analytics and digital twin technology; this initiative seeks to aggregate and integrate the various isolated data sources within our campus; unlocking their full potential for informed decision-making. This consolidation of data will provide valuable insights and a comprehensive overview of our assets; empowering us to make more strategic and well-informed choices. One significant advantage of the CDTI is its ability to reduce emissions. By implementing data-driven decision-making processes and optimizing resource allocation; we can minimize energy waste and carbon emissions; contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly campus. Moreover; the initiative presents an opportunity to decrease operation and maintenance costs. Through the integration of digital solutions and data analysis; we can identify inefficiencies; optimize workflows; and proactively address maintenance needs. Additionally; the initiative places a strong emphasis on prioritizing employee health and safety. By adopting digital tools and automation; we can minimize physical risks associated with specific tasks and enhance overall safety protocols.

32338,Development of a Robotic System for Remote Inspection,The inspection of a construction site is an effective method for ensuring that a particular project is going as planned and in accordance with the project requirements and relevant standards and regulations. Traditional inspection necessitates periodic site visits from various professionals; meaning that the professionals engaged in these inspections must travel frequently between sites and employ various types of equipment for the assessment. This may pose safety and health risks; labour shortages; and gender discrimination; particularly in remote areas like northern Canada. As a favourable alternative to dispatching professionals to carry out site inspections in person; the goal of this project is to enable immersive and real-time remote construction inspection. The expected outcomes of the project include a mobile robotic sensing system that can be operated by inspectors through Mixed Reality (MR) technology using 5G network. In this system; Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and Building Information Modelling (BIM) will be employed to provide enhanced and standardized inspection through cloud computing.,QipeiMei,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,1.

32340,Application of Mixed Reality Technology for Construction Management,Construction is a vast; dynamic; and complex industry that employs millions of people across Canada. Annually; it generates about $141 billion for the economy; accounting for 7.5% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP). Over the past few decades; the construction sector has remained labour-intensive with low productivity compared to other industries; as modern information technology is rarely used. The construction sector in Canada continues to grapple with issues such as safety concerns and skilled worker shortages. Mixed Reality (MR) has emerged as one of the top innovations transforming various industries. In this project; our goal is to develop innovative MR solutions to enhance current construction management practices; thereby improving safety and productivity in the construction sector. The project consists of two components: 1) The application of MR technology for skilled worker training: We will create a digital twin of the construction environment; enabling workers to learn the construction process and equipment handling in an immersive training environment through MR technology. 2) The application of MR technology to support construction operations: MR technology can merge virtual information with the real world; providing additional details about equipment and activities. This technology will be applied in conjunction with building information modeling (BIM) to track construction progress and identify potential hazards.,QipeiMei,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,1.

32341,OncoProfiler for early-stage cancer diagnosis,Efforts to achieve early detection have led to substantial improvements in cure and survival in patients with cancer. While the institution of routine screening is often very effective; we remain unable to identify all cancers at an early stage. The reason is twofold- non-existent screening for some cancers and invasive screening for others. Researchers at Toronto Metropolitan University have invented OncoProfiler; a quantum sensor that enhances the signal output of Raman microscopy and is capable of detecting trace amount of tumor associated content from patient blood. This non-invasive test offers several advantages such as a holistic picture of the tumor; rapid diagnosis and repeated sampling making it suitable for cancer screening. The ultra-sensitivity of the OncoProfiler has resulted in high diagnostic accuracy in cancer diagnosis; particularly for early-stage cancers. The proposed project tests the performance of OncoProfiler with a large set of blood samples from patients with confirmed stage I and II cancer diagnosis. We aim to test 12 different types of cancers; including colorectal; bladder; head and neck; hepatobiliary; lung; lymphoma; leukemia; ovary; pancreas; myeloma; esophageal/gastric; breast; thyroid; kidney; endometrium; prostate; melanoma; and sarcoma.,KrishnanVenkatakrishnan,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,General lab skills; general computer skills; graphic illustrations; figures and plots generation; report writing,
32342,Development and utilization of transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines to study cardiac regeneration,Cardiac muscle re-perfusion is essential after myocardial infarction. Humans have a very limited capacity to efficiently grow new vessels (collaterals) to irrigate the damaged portion of the ventricle. On the contrary; zebrafish coronary vessels respond to injury by rapidly proliferating and growing; building a vascular network covering the injured area in few days. This response is critical to heart regeneration and limited to early stages after injury. Recapitulating mechanisms regulating the efficient revascularization of the zebrafish heart might have important therapeutic implications. We are interested in identifying important regulators of vascular biology involved in different aspects of revascularization and angiogenesis including sprouting; migration; specification and maturation. As part of our efforts; we develop sophisticated genetic models to investigate key regeneration processes. The student involved in this project will contribute to these efforts by developing mutant and transgenic zebrafish lines. This work will involve the use of CRISPR/Cas 9 technology and the Tol2 transposase system to genetically engineer zebrafish. During the duration of the project the student will learn how to leverage these approaches using well established protocols in the lab. This work will include: basic molecular biology (e.g.; RT-PCR; gel electrophoresis; qPCR); zebrafish handling and basic bioinformatics (e.g.; CRISPR guide design software; ZFIN; Ensembl) and basic fluorescent stereomicroscopy.,RubenMarin Juez,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-31,Although preferred; previous experience with the above mentioned approaches is not required and the student will have the opportunity to learn them during the internship.

32344,Modélisation et étude de l’endommagement en fatigue des câbles électriques à haute tension / Modeling and fatigue damage study of high voltage electrical cables,High voltage cables are critical to many industrial processes and machines where the demand for higher performance levels is constant. These cables are however vulnerable to induced vibrations which could compromise their long-term integrity. On the other hand; the complex stranded structure of high voltage cable makes their analyses and damage interpretation difficult. This research project aims to the development of cable numerical simulation tools allowing to relate vibration intensities to damage conditions. These tools will ultimately support the design of more reliable systems.,SebastienLalonde,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-06,The student must first exhibit aptitudes for team collaboration as well as a high level of professionalism in his or her work.

32345,Patient-engaged Health Research in the Scleroderma Patient-centred Intervention Network (SPIN),Patients have a right to be involved in their health care; and this includes research on their health. Working in partnership with patients to plan; conduct; interpret and communicate research can improve the quality of health research; the relevance and usefulness of research for patients; and the likelihood that research will be used by policymakers to make decisions about health care that reflect patients preferences and needs. However; patients are rarely involved in health research beyond study participants. This is often because little is known on how best to engage patients in health research and how to effectively share research results with patients. The present project aims to address these gaps; and is part of a larger multidisciplinary program of patient-engaged health research in SPIN. The project will involve working across a number of ongoing and planned studies including (i) evidence syntheses (systematic and scoping reviews) to identify evidence on ways to effectively engage patients in applied health research (ii) clinical trials to determine the best methods for communicating research results to patients (iii) stakeholder consultation including patients; patient organisation leaders; researchers and clinicians; to develop methods and progress our work towards developing a model for meaningful and effective patient engagement in health research that can be applied across diseases; conditions; and settings.,BrettThombs,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-06-03,The student should have a background in psychology or another health or health-related field and have an interest in working closely with patients.

We aim to develop machine learning classifiers that can be used in the clinic to distinguish between disease states or outcomes. For this; we mine publicly available datasets and analyze profiles of valuable patient samples collected by collaborators in the clinic. When markers are identified; we conduct validation assays such as flow cytometry; functional assays; or CRISPR cell imaging among others. The final stage of several projects includes the development and translation of custom-capture panel assays that are further validated in a new cohort of patients. Ongoing projects investigate: ● Genomic signatures to predict response to radiotherapy in non-invasive breast cancer ● Single-cell genomics of immune responses to cancer ● Microbial single-cell transcriptomics to understand the general characteristics of bacterial communities ● Contribution of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in health ● Sperm epigenetic markers of male infertility,VanessaDumeaux,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,Required skills: ability to program in R or Python; familiarity with the command line and file manipulation; familiarity with version control (e.g. Git & Github),Computer Science; Molecular Biology
32347,Regulatory Uncertainty and Market Microstructure: Models and Evidence,This project puts forward a novel method and model to measure the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. and Canada; as it is pertinent to the overall innovation landscape of some specific firms. Eventually; we examine how the regulatory uncertainty alters or spurs innovation of technology-driven vis-à-vis commodity companies. More importantly; using structured proxies and developed models we intend to comprehend how the evolution of regulatory uncertainty over time changes the major thrust of market microstructure—that is the ways in which the working processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs; prices; volume; and trading behavior—of selected firms. In addition; it is worth examining if the overall regulatory uncertainty affects production and innovation of companies very strongly; for instance through the granting or rescinding of rights to develop deposits on government lands; varying taxes and subsidies; varying environmental regulation; and evolving international treaties; e.g.; related to global warming. Thus; it is worth developing our regulatory measures that are tailored to technology and/or commodity firms; to see if a tight; robust; and highly significant evidence can be documented. The research endeavor anticipates bridging the disparity between theory and practice by developing two types of measures of regulatory uncertainty—government-based and news-based proxies specifically tailored to each business sector—i.e.; technological advancement or commodity market development. Furthermore; the project will necessitate execution of comparative analysis by performing a battery of simulation exercises and statistical analysis based on actual data of several U.S. and Canadian firms that are active in either basic materials or information technology sectors—listed on the NYSE; NASDAQ; and Toronto stock exchanges. Thus; we also envision to empirically testing the reliability and applicability of proposed regulatory uncertainty proxies and models as to elucidate when and how that type of uncertainty affects determinants of bid-ask spreads and market microstructure variables of selected companies.,Kamal Smimou,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-30,Research activities of this project will be undertaken predominantly through aspects of research training provided to the student.

32352,Susceptibility to posttraumatic disorders: towards a personalized medicine in psychiatry,Rationale: There is an urgent need to gain a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD risk to develop efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Veterans with PTSD have a higher chance of developing hypertension compared to those without PTSD. Chronic; low-grade inflammation is also consistently observed in both hypertension and PTSD; suggesting shared inflammatory components. Still; little data is available on the causal relationship between inflammation; blood pressure; and PTSD. Furthermore; there is still an urgent need to find biomarkers to quickly identify “at-risk” individuals. Of note; brain biomarkers for neurological diseases usually require invasive cerebrospinal fluid sampling as plasma levels may not be related to brain-specific sources. Recently; increasing attention has been drawn towards brain-derived exosomes. Brain-derived exosomes are produced by brain cells and reach the plasma after crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB); reach the plasma. Thus; brain-derived exosomes measurable in plasma may be a powerful tool to develop accessible biomarkers associated with PTSD risk. Aims and approaches: The proposed project aims to identify peripheral and brain biomarkers of increased susceptibility to psychological trauma; with a primary focus on blood pressure; inflammation; BBB integrity and brain-derived exosomes in mice. You will use our unique predator stress model of PTSD; in which avoidance behaviors will be assessed to divide the stressed group into “resilient” and “susceptible” mice. Peripheral and central inflammatory and exosomal markers; markers of BBB integrity; as well as blood pressure will be measured several times before and after predator exposure. The project will help to (1) determine the association between immune response; BBB integrity; and higher susceptibility to psychological trauma; and (2) identify early predictors of high vulnerability/PTSD risk for better targeting of "at-risk" individuals.,JessicaDeslauriers,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-20,The student must be pursuing undergraduate studies (bachelor’s degree; or equivalent) in a field relevant to research: pharmacy; molecular biology; biomedical sciences; biochemistry or any other related discipline.

32353,Auditor-Client Relationship: A Machine Learning Approach,Professional relationships are critical to the appropriate functioning of our societies. Understanding how those relationships begin; continue and dissolve is crucial to the study of human decisions and behaviors (Rivera; 2010); it is a required precursor to the success of those relationships and the various efforts to improve them by practitioners and regulators (Kenrick et al.; 2006). Similarly; understanding auditor client relationships (ACRs); i.e.; how ACRs form; evolve though time; and terminate; is vital to the study of auditing as a social science; and to the advancement of audit practice and regulation. The purpose of this project is to investigate ACR formation; evolution and termination using advanced data analytics methods and tools such as Machine Learning. We seek to investigate how audit market participants; including regulators; auditors; and audit clients consider good” and “bad” auditor-client matches; and how these matches form; evolve; and eventually terminate throughout the ACR. This research project is expected to greatly advance scholarly knowledge about professional relationships and their dynamics. The project will also encourage interdisciplinary research in auditing and other disciplines such as Computer Science; Governance; Psychology and Sociology.,MohamedDrira,Nova Scotia,St. Mary's University,English,2024-05-01,The student must be pursuing undergraduate studies (bachelor’s degree; or equivalent) in a field relevant to research: pharmacy; molecular biology; biomedical sciences; biochemistry or any other related discipline.

32355,Signal processing, and machine learning techniques in medical science,In this project we use some methods in signal processing and machine learning to study different problems in different problems in medical science. We are currently working on several projects in my research lab (www.mlmelab.com) related to cancers; tumours; and COVID-19; and HIV-AIDS. In this project; we study; analyze and extract relevant information from biomedical signals and then apply filtering; noise reduction; feature extraction; and pattern recognition algorithms to uncover valuable insights about a patient's health condition. We use signal processing methods to enhance medical image (such as CT scan; MRI; ultrasound) quality; remove noise; improve resolution; segment anatomical structures; and extract features for diagnostic purposes. We apply signal processing techniques; such as digital filtering; adaptive filtering; Fourier transform; and wavelet transform; to effectively remove noise; enhance signal quality; and improve the accuracy of subsequent analysis and diagnosis. We also utilize signal processing algorithms to extract relevant features from biomedical signals or images that can provide valuable diagnostic information. These features can include time-domain or frequency-domain characteristics; statistical measures; wavelet coefficients; Fourier coefficients; or morphological features. We apply signal processing techniques to genomic and proteomic data to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of information contained within. This involves tasks such as DNA sequence alignment; gene expression analysis; motif finding; and protein structure prediction. Signal processing algorithms play a crucial role in identifying patterns; detecting anomalies; and extracting meaningful information from genomic data. Furthermore; we apply machine learning algorithms to classify medical data into different categories or classes. For example; classifying medical images as normal or abnormal; or diagnosing diseases based on symptoms. We also utilize regression analysis; clustering; natural language processing; deep learning; and time series analysis; to predict patient outcomes; extract information from medical text data; detecting tumors and analyzing pathology slides.,MohammadHassanzadeh,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Any undergraduate student (second year or above) of the fields mentioned before will be fine for this project.

32357,Rotator Cuff full-thickness tear assessment using Reinforcement Learning (RL),Shoulder injuries are a common occurrence in adults; and they are currently assessed using ultrasound or MRI. Compared to MRI; ultrasound assessment is fast; safe; and cost-effective; however; obtaining an ultrasound image that contains all the necessary imaging landmarks to assess a full-thickness tear is often challenging. As a result; only a few sonographers are able to perform this ultrasound examination. The objective of this project is to use reinforcement learning techniques to develop an intelligent agent that can automatically perform an analysis on shoulder ultrasound videos acquired by a lightly trained user. The first task in the image analysis pipeline is to identify the relevant frames from an ultrasound video. We aim to use deep reinforcement learning techniques that combine the representational power of deep learning with reinforcement learning. The potential of DRL in medicine and medical imaging has not yet been fully explored.

32358,User experience (UX) design for AI-empowered systems,In recent years; AI-empowered software systems; such as music and video recommendation applications; voice assistance systems; decision support tools; and intelligent cyber-physical systems (e.g.; drones); have grown significantly. While the technology behind these systems is increasingly powerful; today's AI-empowered systems are experiencing a user experience (UX) design innovation crisis; which limits their ability to truly improve people's lives and meet practical needs. The overall goal of this project is to investigate; create; and assess a new set of UX design-support techniques and tools that harness the power of intelligent data-driven systems to support end users. These techniques and tools can facilitate the collaborative and creative UX design process; and assist software practitioners in creating more usable and innovative data-driven systems. To achieve this; we will focus on identifying; modelling; detecting; and using UX design patterns that capture the emergent characteristics of AI systems. Based on these patterns; creativity support tools will be investigated to help UX designers organize and retrieve design artifacts (e.g.; sketches; mock-ups; and storyboards). Further; tools that use these design patterns will also be studied for synchronous and asynchronous design collaboration among various multidisciplinary stakeholders (e.g.; designers; developers; data scientists; and end users). These efforts take a human-centered perspective; involving designers and other software stakeholders throughout the process of proposing; creating; and evaluating techniques and tools.,JinghuiCheng,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-20,- Motivated learner; critical thinker; and team contributor - Experience or interests in human-computer interaction and/or user-centered interaction design - Passionate for UX and design,Engg-Software; Design; Industrial Design and Technology; Computer Science; Engg-Computer

In our previous work; we have identified nine roles of OSS practitioners based on the contributive activities they performed towards their projects. We have also identified 16 categories of information that exists in the issue discussion threads that can potentially support OSS practitioners retrieve and discover useful and otherwise hidden elements from the discussion threads. Supervised; automated techniques have been used to classify the issue discussion sentences into these information types. However; it is unrealistic to expect these automated techniques to achieve 100% accuracy. Thus; following a human-in-the-loop ideology; effective user interaction design needs to be put in place to make these efforts beneficial to the real OSS practitioners. In this project; we will leverage our previous studies to explore the design of a role-based; AI-enabled but human-in-the-loop tool to support diverse OSS stakeholders in discovering and retrieving information that is relevant to their goals and needs from the ITSs. We will follow a user-centered; iterative process in the design and development of this tool. Namely; we will start by creating a set of personas of OSS stakeholders based on previous studies. We will then create sketches and wireframes to explore the design space with the OSS stakeholders. The fidelity of the prototypes will be increased continuously with gradually added automated modules to iteratively meet the users’ expectations. The finished system will be deployed and tested with real OSS stakeholders. In terms of interaction design ideas; we will explore ways to encourage collaborative tagging in the context of OSS development with the support of machine-generated suggestions.,JinghuiCheng,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-20,- Motivated learner; critical thinker; and team contributor. - Experience and/or knowledge in user-centered interaction design techniques; such as personas; sketching; wireframing; user testing; and prototype development. - Front-end development skills in HTML; CSS; and JavaScript. - Knowledge and/or skills in front-end and back-end architectures/APIs. - Motivation and ability to adapt to a new programming language and/or a new development environment.,Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Information Studies; Engg-Software; Design; Industrial Design and Technology
32360,Intelligent mining of user interface design artifacts,During UCD; Design examples are obtained; used and shared to draw an analogy from full-fledged previous designs. This analogical technique is important because arguably all design starts with transforming; combining; and adapting elements from previous works. Additionally; the previous designs provide a shortcut for articulating complex interaction concepts and thus support inspiration and improves communication. For example; designers of a new online photo sharing platform may draw analogy from Twitter and Facebook to illustrate the commenting user interface; while some users may provide feedback that an interface similar to Google Docs or Acrobat Reader is preferred because they need to attach comments to a specific portion of the photo. While design examples are useful for inspiration and communication; software practitioners have experienced significant challenges when incorporating this technique in their practice. One major reason is limited tool support. Particularly; design examples are usually stored as images; with little information ready for searching and modification; historical information and user feedback is also stored out of context. Therefore; the goal of this project is to leverage recent machine learning technologies to help interaction designers further exploit design examples during user-centered design. We will focus on developing a set of technologies as an infrastructure to help interaction designers leverage the internal and external structure of their design artifacts. The project has three major steps. First; we will focus on identifying the design elements in the design examples. Second; we will use the information about the interactive elements to automatically identify the relationships among the design examples. Third; we plan to explore semi-automatic techniques that match the design elements and their relationships identified in the previous steps to established interaction design patterns (e.g. those in Tidwell’s patterns). In all steps; we plan to explore machine learning models to identify and categorize the interaction elements.,JinghuiCheng,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-20,- Motivated learner; critical thinker; and team contributor - Knowledge and/or interests in user-centered interaction design. - Experience and/or skills in machine learning techniques for image processing. - Experience in python - Motivation and ability to learn a machine learning library (e.g. PyTorch).,Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Engg-Software; Information Studies

32363,Examining the Health, Wellbeing, and Quality of Life of Older Adults and Caregivers Living in Rural and Northern Areas,In Canada; one in five older adults live in rural communities. These older adults are often vulnerable; facing multiple challenges to access health care services including poor access to community services/supports; lower incomes; higher costs of living; and challenges with transportation/mobility. Informal caregivers play an important role to support older adults to remain in their communities and age in place. Over 8 million Canadians provided care to a family member or friend who had a long-term health condition; disability; or age-related problem. In rural and northern communities in Canada; the importance of caregiver engagement to support navigation of service access and utilization for older adults is paramount. Students will assist with a literature review to help understand how caregivers support older adults to access care services and navigate the Canadian healthcare system. As a member of Dr. Freeman’s interdisciplinary team; the MITACs intern will conduct a scoping review synthesizing recent research findings on the role caregivers play to support older adults to navigate the healthcare system. Furthermore this scoping review aims to identify and describe the health literacy of rural caregivers specific to northern communities in Canada. With the emergence of literature focusing on role of caregivers as healthcare system navigators as well as expanding of information on health literacy; it is very timely for this scoping review to identify the barriers and facilitators caregivers experience when assisting older adults to navigate the health care system specific to a rural and northern context. The work completed during this MITACs internship may be a foundation for future opportunities at the Masters level.

32364,Examining the Role of Technology to Support Aging in Place in Rural and Northern Communities,Older adults living in rural areas are often vulnerable; facing multiple challenges to access health care including poor access to care; lack of community services; lower incomes; higher costs of living; and challenges with transportation. Use of eHealth technology by older adults is increasing but has been embraced differently than younger persons. In rural; remote; and northern communities in Canada; the importance of eHealth technology including mobile health apps and telehealth has steadily grown in recent years. This research project aims to better understand how older adults perceive and use/do not use eHealth technology. This project works closely with knowledge users from the regional health authority and older adults in northern British Columbia. The intern will be engaged in three ongoing research projects piloting innovative technologies in rural communities. Currently funded projects include looking at lighting for wayfinding for persons with dementia; adaptive clothing to support persons with Parkinson's; and effects of COVID-19 on technology use. The MITACs intern will be involved in a variety of ongoing research activities including literature searching; interviewing older adults and care providers; analysing data and writing of reports. The MITACs student will work collaboratively with our existing team members on this project to ensure more timely and effective ways to disseminate the information to policy and decision makers. As a member of this interdisciplinary team; the MITACs research intern will take an active role to summarize findings to better understand how use of these technologies are mitigating the ‘digital divide’ for older adults residing in rural; remote; and northern communities in Canada.

32365,Fostering Age Friendly Communities,Communities across Canada and globally are focusing on the importance to foster more age-friendly environments that better support inclusion and engagement our contemporary aging population. This project will focus on identifying the critical components necessary to enhance older adult involvement of higher education. Through this internship; trainees will identify and implement strategies to raise awareness and educate others about aging issues and build curriculum to support an increasing age-diverse population. The principles also provide a guiding framework to broaden opportunities for older learners to access higher education. In this project; trainees will conduct an environmental scan of age-friendly universities and summarize recommendations according to age friendly university principles.

32366,Nanomaterial electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion,The research project entails the development of nanomaterials geared towards renewable energy conversion. Specifically; the transformation of CO2 to fuels and value added chemicals; powered by renewable electricity; will be pursued here. Metallic nanoparticles with rationally designed surface catalytic sites will be synthesized with wet-chemical routes. Following their characterization with techniques such as XPS; TEM and XRD; their performance will be investigated through a host of electrochemical methods. Specifically; we will aim to develop nanoparticles that convert CO2 to multi-carbon products. The project will explore how surface chemistry (e.g. functional ligands; types of active sites...) stabilizes CO2 reduction intermediates and steers the reaction down a desired pathway. In tandem; in situ Raman spectroscopy will elucidate the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface throughout the course of reaction and will provide a direct link between the catalyst structure and its overall activity+selectivity. In all; depending on the student interests; they will learn aspects of nanomaterials; electrocatalysis; and spectroscopy. Furthermore; there will be ample room for flexibility and collaboration within the labs collaborative environment.,NikolayKornienko,Québec,Université de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-06-03,In general; an understanding of eletrochemistry; nanomaterials; catalysis and spectroscopy would be appreciated; though a thorough knowledge of any of these areas is not required.,
32367,AI x AR: Combining Augmented Reality with AI for Immersive Media,Summary: In this project; we explore AI for Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) towards immersive media for authoring; sketching; communication; and presentation. Through this project; we will demonstrate how AR expands the future of communication tools by developing a prototype system using Hololens or Mobile AR. Please see the following as an example. - Teachable Reality https://ryosuzuki.org/teachable-reality/ - RealitySketch: https://ryosuzuki.org/realitysketch/ - Snap Creative Challenge: https://www.snapcreativechallenge.com/takeaways2021/ - Touchable Spoken Words: https://science.ucalgary.ca/news/touchable-spoken-words-bring-fantastic-life Background: Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) is becoming the next computing platform. AR interfaces can provide an exciting opportunity that the current desktop or mobile interfaces cannot do --- it overlays information on top of the physical environment; so that we can seamlessly interact with digital worlds within the physical space; instead of touching or interacting with a screen. Goal and Research Questions: By leveraging this capability; AR/MR interfaces have a great promise for communication tools to enhance co-located or remote conversation; discussion; and presentation. The goal of this research is to "re-design" such communication tools for the coming augmented reality era---where we no longer use slides or powerpoints but shows the content interactively embedded in the real world. There are many research questions to explore: 1) how can we incorporate Natural Language Processing into AR; 2) how can we enable the user to communicate through different modalities like sketching and conversation; and 3) how can we leverage the spatial and physical interactions by leveraging AR. Methodology and Publication Venue: To answer these questions; we have three steps: 1) design: discuss and decide what kind of AR interfaces we should make; 2) prototype: create a working prototype with A-Frame/Three.js or Unity; and 3) evaluation: conduct a user evaluation study to measure how useful such a tool could be. Based on these findings; we also write a paper which we plan,RyoSuzuki,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,First; the student should have a strong "motivation" in publishing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research to the top venue like CHI or UIST. If the student already has HCI research experience (specifically; AR/VR; Tangible; Visualization); this is definitely a plus; but not required (but a strong motivation is required). We welcome students from diverse backgrounds (not necessarily in CS; as HCI is an interdisciplinary field); but we expect the student has minimal knowledge or experience in software and hardware prototyping. Previous experience in 3D programming (Unity; Unreal; Three.js; A-Frame; 8th Wall; etc) is a huge plus.,
32370,Maskwio'mi: Biomedical Studies of a Re-Discovered Mi'kmaq Traditional Skin Remedy from Birch Bark,The proposed Globalink project is a continuation of previous successful Globalink project involves the study of medicinal properties of birch bark extracts. Preliminary results show that the extract of birch (betula papyrifera) made in a fire pit method by the Mi'kmaq people contains more than 200 organic compounds. The student project involves the determination of medicinal properties; such as antibiotic properties; of this extract as a whole and of fractionations thereof. Bierenstiel developed new technology using electricity to substitute the conditions in a fire pit. This allows a better control of the extract conditions. Preliminary results show that this new technology allows faster reaction time and more product yield. The student will be trained using the new extractor technology to safely produce the extract from birch bark in the laboratory. During this process; the different extracts are fractionated as a function of time and extraction conditions (as well as compared to extract from the fire pit method) and then studied using newly built microbiology lab. The student will be trained to independently setup antibiotic and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) experiments. The student’s role is to fully assist in the research data gathering of maskwio'mi for chemical analysis (NMR; FTIR; FT-Raman; UV-vis; UPLC-QToF-MSMS; GC-MSMS) and provide essential data for scientific publications. The project is now further expanded to include biomedical studies such as antibiotic and anti-inflammatory experiences in our mircobiology laboratory. This research project can be conducted in a covid-safe manner.,MatthiasBierenstiel,Nova Scotia,Cape Breton University,English,2024-05-01,The Globalink project can be adjusted to the skill level of the participating student. Ideally; a student with a study background of biochemistry; medicinal chemistry; microbiology; pharmacology; or related field is preferred to ensure high level of experiential learning for the student. The project is very interdisciplinary and we welcome different study disciplines. In the past; second year students have participated with a focus on hands-on; lab bench experiments; whereas upper level students could utilize their discipline-specific knowledge on in-depth experimental data analysis. One important factor is excitement for research by the student with an inquisitive mindset.,
32371,Investigating the Medicinal Potential of Invasive Weed Extracts,In this project; the student(s) will investigate how bioautography can be optimized to screen invasive plant extracts for their antimicrobial or enzyme inhibition potential. Bioautography is a small-scale technique that combines thin-layer chromatography (TLC; for compound separation) and bioassay development (antimicrobial or enzyme inhibition screening) in one. There are a few different methods by which bioautography can be performed and the preferred method will depend on the nature of the assay being utilized. As part of the planned work for this project; students will modify traditional bioassay protocols; such as the Kirby-Bauer antimicrobial disc diffusion assays; to work with the TLC-bioautography system.,TinaBott,Alberta,MacEwan University,English,2024-05-01,Students should have a background in organic or medicinal chemistry; biochemistry; or microbiology with lab experience (minimum 3 university-level courses in one or more of these areas that include a laboratory component). Experience using the techniques related to the extraction and separation of organic compounds and/or analyzing NMR spectroscopic data would be ideal. Experience handling cell cultures and/or conducting other biological assays would be an asset. Students should be able to perform academic literature searches using scientific databases. Students should be able to read procedural information from academic papers and have a reasonable understanding of the techniques being performed.,
32372,Freshwater food webs across the globe,Ecological communities are organized into complex networks of trophic interactions between the species that are part of them; namely food-webs. These webs depict the patterns of energy flow and nutrient cycling among the different compartments of the ecosystem; processes that are essential to ecosystem functioning. Their functioning depends on their structure; including the number; abundance; and functional traits of the species that are part of the network. Hence; any natural or anthropogenic variation (e.g.; river damming; habitat type) that affects species distribution changes the way that food-webs are structured and might change; consequently; its functioning. Modelling the structure and dynamics of food-webs is frequently a hard task given the lack of information about species trophic interactions. To facilitate such as goal; this project aims to build a global-scale open database of predator-prey interactions in freshwaters. This will be initially carried out through a systematic review of the primary literature (articles published in scientific journals) and grey literature (conference abstracts; undergraduate and graduate dissertations) in any language. The review will collect multiple information from the literature; including predator identity and size; prey identity and consumed abundance/volume; geographic location; sampling size; and habitat type. Extracted information will be integrated into the database through a workflow that will automatically fill out a wide range of climate and impact-related variables provided by remote sensing. This research project will be the starting point to large-scale analyses that will allow us to (i) model the trophic interactions performed by freshwater species in different scenarios; (ii) understand how natural and anthropogenic variation in nature affects predator-prey dynamics; and (iii) predict how future changes will affect the structure and dynamics of freshwater food webs.,BrunoEleres Soares,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,The student must have a background in environmental sciences; zoology; or ecology in order to better grasp the goals and nuances of the project. Students with specific research experience in natural history or freshwater ecology are preferred. In addition; students with some practice performing literature reviews and/or using Excel would be preferred given the main tasks they would carry over here. Practice in the use of R for data analysis is a plus; but not mandatory.,Biological Sciences; Biology; Computer Science; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Zoology
32373,Machine learning for immune dynamics,A typical immune response is multiplexed and highly dynamical: after exposure to a pathogen; cytokines are secreted and multiple cells are activated. Recently; we identified a “universal antigen encoding” phenomenon; quantifying and modelling how the immune system encodes information in the dynamics of the cytokines (see Achar et al; Science; 376; 880-884). But one still does not know how a single immune cell interprets that information. Using a robotic platform it is possible now to monitor multiple markers in single cells as a function of time and thus to reverse-engineer the way immune cells "interpret" such information. The goal of the internship is to 1. use machine learning to analyze data provided by our collaborators at NIH; to understand the structure of the data and build an interpretable embedding 2. build a mathematical model of the dynamics in latent space in response to different antigen strengths,PaulFrancois,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-06-03,Students should have formal training in either physics or computer science; and some practical knowledge of machine learning algorithms and concepts (dimensional reduction; neural networks; etc...).

32375,Additive Manufacturing and Thermal Characterization of Thermally Conductive Composites,Initial research has developed a novel process of using additive manufacturing (AM) to fabricate continuous wire polymer composites (CWPC) for improved effective thermal conductivity and strength over conventional discontinuous fibre polymer composites. This project will build upon recent progress fabricating continuous metal wire polymer composites using a modified open-source fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printer. This technique creates components with relatively high directional effective thermal conductivities and ongoing work will result in the ability to create components using continuous high-conductivity pitch-based carbon fibres. Aspects of this work will include nozzle design; fibre treatments; fibre cutting; and printer control. Recently commercially available polymer composite feedstocks will also be used in combination with our continuous fibre approach to further improve thermal and mechanical properties. The next steps will be to design and configure an open-source printer for high temperature use to facilitate printing continuous fibres (metal or high conductivity carbon fibres) embedded in thermoplastics such as polyetherimide (PEI) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK). Here challenges will include the design of high-temperature printing components and processes to allow for the reliable printing of high-end composites.,RogerKempers,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-05,No skills available,Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Manufacturing

32377,Understanding determinants of aquatic biodiversity in Southern Quebec,One of the most pressing issues of the 21st century is the alarming decrease in biodiversity; which poses a significant threat to both ecosystem services and human well-being. Endangered species are facing the risk of extinction worldwide; while many common species are also experiencing significant declines in their population. Although this decline is occurring across various taxonomic groups; there is noticeable variation in species' responses to global changes in different regions. This variation presents an opportunity to investigate the factors that determine a species' ability to adapt to new environmental conditions. To do so; it is necessary to develop a more profound comprehension of the underlying biodiversity changes using field survey; laboratory experiments; and statistical models. Such knowledge is crucial for estimating changes in ecosystem services; informing policy decisions; and guiding sustainable management strategies and conservation efforts. The concern is growing that protected sites located near disturbed areas such as farmlands or urban agglomerations may not be sufficient to maintain biodiversity in stressful conditions (e.g.; climate change). As a result; it is necessary to identify the factors that influence species distribution to improve biodiversity conservation in a changing world. A study will be carried out to understand the determinants of biodiversity distribution in freshwater ecosystems by surveying a group of wetlands in Southern Quebec; both protected and unprotected; several times during the summer. This study will record various environmental variables and quantify the diversity of aquatic fauna. The survey will be conducted in collaboration with Ducks Unlimited; a non-governmental organization committed to wetland conservation. The findings of this study will help inform the conservation actions of the organization.,RassimKhelifa,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-06-03,The student should have basic knowledge of ecology and biodiversity. The student must have excellent organizational; interpersonal; and communication skills; and a strong commitment to work in a team. The student must be willing to work outdoors and in the laboratory.

32379,Valid inequalities for the quadratic knapsack problem,The quadratic knapsack problem (QKP) is an optimization problem which consists of maximizing a quadratic (profit) function with binary variables subject to a single knapsack constraint. This is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem; with a variety of important applications; for example in the location of satellites; airports; railway stations and freight terminals. This problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. Exact solution techniques for this problems use the branch-and-cut algorithm; which highly rely on the availability of strong valid inequalities or cutting planes. The aim of this project is to use the software package PORTA to analyze the polyhedral structure of the QKP in order to identify valid inequalities for this problem. PORTA is an open source software package; very simple and easy to use; available for both Linux and Windows platforms.,FranklinDjeumou Fomeni,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,English,2024-07-01,Linear algebra Computer programming ( the programming language is not important,Computer Science; Engg-Industrial; Engg-Mechanical; Engineering; Mathematics
32380,Ultrafast laser texturing for CO2 reduction and colour formation,The student will work in the Weck lab on projects related to texturing using ultrafast lasers. Two main sub-projects are envisioned 1- Ultrafast laser surface texturing of plasmonic electrodes for CO2 electroreduction. This project will involve the texturing of copper electrodes with the laser and testing of these electrodes in an electrochemical cell to investigate CO2 electroreduction due to plasmonic activity. CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity will be investigated 2- Ultrafast laser texturing of bulk polymers for colour formation. We have pioneered colour formation on metals using ultrafast lasers; and we are now developing a approach to colour polymers. The goals is to produce a large and stable colour palette in polymers with the ultrafast laser. Both project will involve the use of the ultrafast laser; as well as characterization techniques including optical and electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques (FTIR; Raman; etc.),ArnaudWeck,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,Experience with optical systems (lasers); microscopy (optical and electron microscopy) and spectroscopy techniques would be an asset.,
32381,ODE analysis of iterative methods,The goal of this project is to apply tools of differential equations to analyze convergence of various numerical methods to solve nonlinear systems of equations and minimize scalar-valued functions. Newton's method to solve the nonlinear system of equations F(x)=0 is x_{n+1}=x_n - F'(x_n)^{-1} F(x_n). If we consider x=x(t); a smooth function of time; instead of a sequence of vectors; it turns out that Newton's iteration is exactly Euler's iteration to solve the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) x'=-F'(x)^{-1} F(x) with a step size of one! Tools from ODEs (eg; Lyapunov functionals) can now be used to analyze the convergence of this continuous Newton's method. Under some assumptions; the solution of the ODE converges to a solution of the original nonlinear system F(x)=0 in the limit t approaching infinity! This project investigates: i) ODE formulation of Broyden's iteration; another iteration for solving F=0 that does not require the knowledge of the Jacobian F'; ii) ODE formulation of BFGS iteration which minimizes a scalar function; and iii) ODE formulation of nonlinear conjugate gradient iteration which minimizes a scalar function. The latter iteration is particularly relevant today because of its relevance to machine learning. See the paper by W. Su; S. Boyd and E. Candes on "A differential equation for modeling Nesterov's accelerated gradient method: theory and insights"; Journal of Machine Learning Research 17 (2016) Paper No. 153.g,ShaunLui,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,- analysis of ODEs (Lyapunov functionals) - numerical analysis (Newton's method; Euler's method for ODEs),
32382,Sphingolipids metabolism alterations in cancer: novel biomarker and potential drug target,Our group recently showed that the accumulation and depletion of specific sphingolipid species are implicated in progression of cancer; however; the mechanisms remain unknown. For instance; in our investigations of patients compared to healthy volunteers; glucosylceramides (GluCer) accumulated; were further increased in aggressive biology; and exhibited pro-proliferative effects in cancer cells. Furthermore; the GluCer-mediated proliferative phenotype was reversed by inhibiting their synthesis using ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitors; with an additive reduction in co-treatment with other targeted anticancer agents. Thus; specific sphingolipids may serve as prognostic markers; and inhibiting enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis has potential as a therapeutic approach. It is thus critical to better understand the biosynthesis of sphingolipids and learn more on their impact on cancer cell phenotypes.,ChantalGuillemette,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,molecular biology; bioinformatics; biochemistry strong interest in oncology rigorous team work Université Laval is a french speaking university.

32383,Dual inhibition of telomere maintenance pathways in cancer,Telomeres; the repetitive ends of chromosomes; shorten with ageing. When a critical telomere length is reached; normal cells stop dividing and enter senescence. Tumor cells; however; bypass this stage of senescence and continue cell divisions with critically short; dysfunctional telomeres. To enable such continued cell divisions; they activate telomere maintenance pathways: 85% of cancers activate telomerase to survive with dysfunctional telomeres; 15% activate the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway (ALT). Work by our group and others show that cells treated with telomerase inhibitors activate ALT and escape the effects of telomerase inhibition. We have developed a new approach to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting both telomere maintenance pathways in multiple myeloma. This dual inhibition of telomere maintenance pathways will prevent cells from escaping inhibition when just one of the pathways is blocked. By targeting both telomere maintenance pathways; we expect the cells to be unable to proliferate and/or will die. This approach has been proven by our group to negatively affect cell viability in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma; but has never been tested in additional cancers. We expect this combined treatment approach to also be effective in other cancer types for several reasons: 1) cancer is characterized by telomere dysfunction; the highest level of dysfunction is found in the most aggressive forms; 2) cancer cells need telomere maintenance pathways to survive; 3) cancer cells initially respond to the inhibition of telomerase but this treatment alone is not sufficient: we argue that this is due to the fact that ALT will be activated and allow the cells to survive when telomerase is inhibited; and 4) our previous work using dual telomere maintenance inhibition in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma has successfully killed the cells.,SabineMai,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-04-30,basic knowledge of cancer biology and cell biology.

32384,Power-boundedness of matrices,Given a square matrix A. It is said to be power-bounded if M(A) = sup_{k >= 0} |A^k| < infinity; where | . | is the matrix 2-norm. If A is power-bounded; can we give a sharp estimate of M(A)? This problem plays an important role in the study of Markov chains; the stability of numerical methods to solve differential equations; etc. While necessary and sufficient conditions are known for determining power-boundedness of matrices; these conditions are not applicable in practice; in general; because they don't depend continuously on the matrix. These conditions also give no information about the magnitude of M(A) when it is finite. Our goal is to use a resolvent condition; which depends continuously on the matrix; to determine power-boundedness and its magnitude in case M(A) is finite. One such condition; known as the Kreiss resolvent condition; is known; but the bound depends on n; the dimension of the matrix; making it useless for operators on infinite dimensional spaces. Hence an added requirement is that the resolvent condition must be independent on n. We have candidate resolvent conditions that improve upon the Kreiss resolvent condition; but they are still dependent on n.,ShaunLui,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,- matrix theory (norms; Jordan form) - real and complex analysis,
32385,Computer-assisted video behavioural analysis of transgenic Shank3B mouse model of autism spectrum disorder,The goal of this research project to is to use sophisticated video analysis software to identify and label complex cognitive; sensory; and social behaviours in mice. Specifically; we work with a transgenic mouse strain; Shank3B; to model autism spectrum disorder. Using sophisticated software employing machine learning approaches to semi-automate behavioural analysis; such as DeepLabCut; the student will learn to analyze pre-recorded videos of mice undergoing a battery of standardized behavioural assays for memory; anxiety; social interest; social communication; and sensory integration. These tests will include novel object recognition; the open field test; the elevated plus maze; the three-chamber test; social novelty test; and cross-modal object recognition; and recordings of social communication via ultrasonic vocalization recording and analysis. These mice will have undergone a similar battery of neuroimaging assessments from which signatures of altered neurophysiology will best be correlated with measures of behavioural symptoms. If successful; the prospective student will also have the opportunity to analyze video; and thus test the efficacy; of novel therapeutic interventions.,AllenChan,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,No specific skills/background are necessary but for a general proficiency with computers. Any background in scientific programming or biostatistics in the MATLAB; Python; and R environments would be very useful but are not necessary. Similarly; a background in video analysis or a familiarity with rodent behavioural assays would be helpful.,
32386,Hardware design for tactile human-robot interaction detection based on sound,Physical interactions between robot and humans are typically measured using torque sensors are the robot joints; or a 6-axis force/torque sensor at the wrist of the robot. However; these sensors can be expensive; and not all robots are equipped with those. Additionally; they can only provide the general location of a contact: for example; somewhere on the arm or on the hand. Lacking more precise information; the ability of the robot to evaluate the intention behind the contact and to react appropriately is limited. In this project; we are exploring the use of microphones placed on the body of the robot to identify where contacts occur; from the sound that is produced when something touches the hard shell of the robot.,MarieCharbonneau,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,Prior knowledge of engineering design; circuits and signal processing; as well as basic CAD software and programming (C and/or Python) skills; will be of great help to complete this project!

32388,Molecular cancer prevention,Our working model is the nickel uptake system of Helicobacter pylori; one of the most successful human pathogens; causing mild to severe gastric pathologies accounting for about one million deaths per year worldwide (mostly cancers). The bacterium is notably considered a leading cause of gastric cancers and MALT lymphoma; as such the World Health Organization identifies H. pylori as a group 1 (definite) carcinogen; and experts estimate that 1 to 3% of the infected population will develop gastric carcinoma; a pathology with poor prognosis (15% survival 5 years after prognosis) representing the third most common cause of death by cancer. The bacterium colonizes the stomach of 50% of the worldwide population where the pathogen survival relies on its ability to scavenge nickel from the gastric milieu. Helicobacter pylori eradication is advised as first-line therapy in early stage disease of gastric MALT lymphoma; complete remission is achieved in 75% of cases; but the treatment is effective with a limited number of antibiotics that are active in the stomach. Nickel transporters in H. pylori are of notable medical relevance as they display critical nickel-uptake function enabling colonization of the host; but also serve as passageway for bismuth-based therapeutics currently used in H. pylori eradication regiments. The research project investigates the transport mechanisms of nickel and bismuth-derivative drugs across the membranes of H. pylori using structural biology and biochemical approaches. We aim at accelerating research on these medically relevant proteins by elucidating their structures and functional mechanisms to promote the discovery of innovative strategies to treat the burden of H. pylori associated cancers. The research project will contribute to develop novel anti-pylori molecules; and improve current bismuth-based therapies; which are much needed to overcome the emergence of resistant H. pylori strain,CharlesCalmettes,Québec,Université INRS,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The project will consist in investigating the structure-function relationship of nickel transporters and nickel-homeostasis proteins. The candidate will use multidisciplinary approaches combining molecular biology; protein biochemistry; structural biology; electrophysiology and bioinformatics to dissect the molecular mechanism of nickel transport across the outer and inner membranes of the pathogen. Structures of nickel transporters will be helpful in the design of specific inhibitors to treat high-risk populations for gastric cancers and lymphomas.,Biochemistry; Biology; Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Engg-Biological; Engg-Biomedical; Microbiology; Pharmacology; Biological Sciences

We have identified several important factors; such as metal deposition method; metal film thickness; choice of elastomer/textile; topography of the elastomer/textile; and interfacial adhesion. We are continuing to study these and other factors to maximize the flexibility and stretchability of metallic conductors for wearable electronics. We are using our new methodologies to prepare stretchable and wearable metallic conductors and use them in new stretchable and wearable electronic devices. Devices of interest include strain sensors; biomedical sensors; and light-emitting displays.

32392,Developing an environmental governance global learning network,There is a growing body of research; guidance and action to support better understanding of and improvements in environmental governance; including frameworks; methodologies and initiatives for assessment and responsive change. Yet many such efforts are fragmented / siloed and the reach of knowledge about and action from them is often limited. As such; inclusive and equitable opportunities to foster dialogue; enable interaction; share experiences; and inspire meaningful action are critical to improving environmental governance. Through such opportunities it may be possible to move towards more equitable and impactful spaces for addressing related socio-ecological issues; at and across multiple scales. This project will contribute to establishing guiding concepts and a structure for a collaborative environmental governance global network and tools to support the network (e.g. online learning portal) and that facilitates shared learning and action among actors in environmental governance; coordinated by organizations that themselves convene and support a broad spectrum of environmental governance actors and with consideration for equity and the need for multi-directional learning between actors. The key organizing principles for the network and tools include: ● Meaningfully connecting and building on existing networks and platforms ● Enabling power-sharing and equitable power relationships between network members ● Ensuring accessible; credible and inclusive information ● Recognizing and supporting diverse governance approaches and frameworks; including appropriate recognition and support for Indigenous peoples and local communities’ governance of territories of life ● Utilizing human-centred design ● Ensuring sustainability / continuity Generating new knowledge and building collaborative relationships can create space for participants involved in learning processes to develop shared understandings of systems or issues that the actors involved have interests in. The learning portal will offer the opportunity for actors to share information in a designated space and learn new information that is available for those who engage with these elements.,MelanieZurba,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-06,The student will have an educational background in a field relevant to the research; such as human geography; natural resources management; environmental studies; political sciences; or another related field.

32393,Hybrid laser welding of aluminum alloys,Objectives: The goal of the project offered will be to relate the properties and microstructures in aluminum welds with the thermal cycles imposed during welding. This will be done by comparing the hypothetical calculated cooling based on the travel speed and arc heat input; with properties observed. This will provide insights regarding how wide or tolerant the operating window during welding may be to subtle variations in welding speed and arc energy. Methodology: The main focus will be on developing weld parameters which deposit uniform and defect-free welds in aluminum plate. This will be done using a 6-axis robotic welding system; and a gas metal arc welding torch. Thermocouples will be embedded to measure the temperature profile during welding. Following welding; the materials will be extracted and metallographically prepared for optical and electron microscopy. Electron back scattered diffraction will be used to determine the grain size; and transmission electron microscopy will reveal the crystallographic structure and composition of the inclusions in the aluminum. Mechanical properties will be measured using conventional tensile testing; and a new instrumented hardness tester will be utilized to provide a spatially resolved distribution of yield stress for the different zones of the weld. The behavior during yielding of the bulk sample will be correlated with the yield points of various zones of as-deposited and reheated weld material.,AdrianGerlich,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-06,The student must have a strong background in physical metallurgy; and mechanical deformation.

32394,Biochemical and structural studies of bacterial secretion systems,Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are versatile and dynamic nano-machines that Gram-negative bacteria have adapted for numerous different biological functions. These include killing competing bacteria; pathogenesis; and direct communication with any type of cell (mammalian; reptile; plant). The T6SS is analogous to a crossbow that shoots poisoned arrows to kill enemy cells. However; bacteria have also evolved immunity mechanisms to resist their enemies in a back-and-forth arms race of poisonous effectors versus life-saving immunity proteins. For this project we aim to understand the molecular details of the poisonous effectors and the life-saving immunity proteins to learn how bacteria compete against each other. In this project we aim to purify and study a T6SS effector protein with its immunity protein pair. The goal will be to make expression constructs of the effector/immunity pair for protein purification. Purified proteins will then be studied biophysically and their structure determined by the appropriate structural biology technique (X-ray crystallography; NMR; or cryoEM). We will then use this data to study the biochemistry of the effector and how the immunity protein inhibits the effector toxin. This will involve a wide range of biochemical assays and toxicity assays within a bacterial host. We will also study the conformational dynamics of the effector/immunity protein interaction. Overall this will reveal the specific molecular adaptations used to create a potent effector toxin.,GerdPrehna,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-06,A student should be pursing a degree in biochemistry or a closely related field. Coursework in chemistry; biochemistry; and molecular biology is required. Experience with techniques involving DNA and protein purification is also desirable but not required. For example; PCR; molecular cloning; protein expression and purification.,
32395,Bioinformatics or Wetlab Technician in Genomics & Metagenomics,We are seeking individuals to assist with wet lab and/or computational methods for one of our current research projects. Project descriptions are available at EcoEvoGeno.org but our two main research streams are briefly described here: 1. Microbiome analysis of blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis). Both species are known to harbor many different human pathogens in their gut microbiomes (e.g. Lyme disease; Powassan virus; Babesiosis; Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever). You will assist with the generation or analysis of sequencing data to help compare the microbiome communities of male and female ticks representing different age classes from both species.

Candidate genes for plant health in invasive plant purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria). We are seeking individuals who can assist with genome annotation and investigation of gene function in the North American invasion and spread of this invasive plant and associated changes in flowering time. This work could lead to novel gene discovery for agriculture and resource management applications. Both projects build upon a 3-year field experiment at the Queen's University Biological Station (QUBS) -- https://qubs.ca,RobertColautti,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-01,Specific requirements will depend on the background expertise and research interests of the candidate.

32397,Leafhoppers population dynamics in strawberry fields in Quebec,In the last years; with an increase of temperatures; several new insects are more and more frequent in Quebec. Not only that; the number of insect pests is also exponentially increasing; like for example the leafhoppers. A leafhopper is the common name for any species from the family Cicadellidae. These insects are plant feeders that suck plant sap and during the feeding; if the number of insects on the plant is very high; can cause devastating damage. Another problem is that leafhoppers are well known vectors of virus and bacterial diseases putting the risk of several crops. Here in Quebec; there have been particular problems with leafhoppers affecting strawberry fields. Quebec is the number one producer of strawberry in Canada; and every day is trying to reduce as much as possible the amount of insecticide in the field. But how can we do that with a high number of leafhoppers in the field? Through this project we will investigate the diversity of leafhoppers in strawberry fields in Quebec and different aspects of the populations dynamics.,EdelPerez Lopez,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The main skill required from the student is curiosity; critical thinking and love for science. Of course; students with a ecology; entomology or biology background will enjoy more the project.

One thing is guaranteed: a lot of delicious strawberry from our growers.,
32398,Biochemical and structural studies bacteriophage proteins,Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or GAS) is a major pathogen that infects and kills millions of people world-wide annually. Central to its pathogenicity are toxins that are encoded within the bacteriophages that infect Streptococcus. Through infection; bacteriophages transfer new and multiple toxins between bacterial hosts creating new strains of deadly bacteria. Our aim is to understand this process at the biochemical level by discovering how the bacteriophage manipulates the various pathways of its Streptococcus host. In this project we aim to purify and study both phage proteins and streptococcus proteins. The goal will be to make expression constructs of each protein for purification. Purified proteins will then be studied biophysically and their structures determined by the appropriate structural biology technique (X-ray crystallography; NMR; or cryoEM). We will then use this data to study the biochemistry of the phage protein; the biochemistry of the streptococcus host protein; and study how the phage manipulates the activity of the host protein. We also aim to determine the structures of the proteins in complex. This project will involve a wide range of biochemical assays and functional assays. We will also study the conformational dynamics of the interaction between the protein binding partners. Overall this will reveal the specific molecular mechanisms that bacteriophages use to control their hosts.,GerdPrehna,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-06,A student should be pursing a degree in biochemistry or a closely related field.

32399,Investigating methods of stem cell differentiation to peripheral nerves for the study of regeneration,Peripheral nerves are important for promoting wound healing and regeneration following injury in various tissues and organs. Our lab is investigating the use of co-culture systems to study how peripheral sensory neurons interact with other cell types that are important in regeneration. To study this phenomenon; we need a reliable source of neurons in culture. Therefore; the goal of this project is to optimize a protocol to derive peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The student will culture hiPSCs; prepare different culture conditions and test the ability of stem cells to differentiate into neurons over time by performing immunocytochemistry and Western Blot analysis. Completion of this project will help to establish a source of neurons in vitro which will be used to investigate the role of neurons in influencing pro-regenerative behaviour in other cell populations.,SamanthaPayne,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-06,Students with a background in neuroscience are preferred.

32400,Examining the effects of manipulative warming, nitrogen addition and vegetation composition on greenhouse gas emissions from boreal peatlands,Northern peatlands; persistently contributing to climate cooling; store ~30% of the world’s terrestrial soil carbon (C); equivalent to half of the total atmospheric C. This enormous storage of soil C results from a persistently greater production than its decomposition. Moreover; northern peatlands are globally significant sources of methane (CH4). Therefore; northern peatlands represent a globally important reservoir of soil C and play an important role in the global C cycle and climate system. The ecosystem greenhouse gas (GHG) emission function of northern peatlands is tightly coupled to climate through its feedback to changes in hydrology and vegetation composition. However; the majority of peatlands are located in boreal ecosystems where the climate is experiencing a warmer climate and increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition also occurs. Therefore; the ecosystem functions of GHG emissions of boreal peatlands are susceptible to changes in climate via changes in soil climate and vegetation composition that may result from the projected warming and increased atmospheric N deposition. However; no field experiments have been carried out to examine how the GHG emission of boreal peatlands responds to the concurrent changes in soil climate; N addition; and vegetation composition. This unknown knowledge has caused significant uncertainty in projecting the role that boreal peatlands will play in the global C cycling in the context of climate change due to the lack of understanding of how ecosystem functions respond to climate change and human disturbances. To address the above outstanding issue; this proposed program is to examine how the GHG emissions in boreal peatlands respond to the concurrent warming and N addition and how they are regulated by changes in vegetation composition via a globally unique manipulative field experiment. This exploratory project will lead us to enhance our mechanistic understanding of how boreal peatlands respond to climate and land-use changes.,JianghuaWu,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-20,Some knowledge of physical geography; soil science; ecosystem ecology and biology and wetlands; in general; will be an asset.

32402,Seismic performance of reinforced concrete slab-to-wall connections using 3D nonlinear finite element methods,The research will investigate the seismic behavior of reinforced concrete slab-to-wall connections with a focus on the shear transfer mechanism that occurs between the slab and the wall. Previously tested models of typical connections under combined vertical and cyclic lateral loads will be simulated using advanced nonlinear finite element methods with the objective to study the mechanics of in-plane shear transfer that occurs at the slab-wall connection and the combined effects of the deep beam action developing in the plane of the slab and the moment transfer due to gravity loads. The numerical results in terms of lateral load resistance curves; cracking patterns and characteristics of connection failure will be used for model calibration and verification. Next; the model will be used to conduct a detailed parametric investigation to examine the strength and deformation capacity of the connection for lateral load transfer as a function of gravity load transfer. The effects of the two combined actions on the rotation capacity and the effective stiffness of the slab wall assembly will be explored with reference to the detailing of the reinforcement anchored through the connection and the direction of lateral load action relative to the longitudinal axis of the wall cross-section. The numerical study will be extended to consider the effect of slab boundary conditions along the wall axis; as a parameter in the evaluation of punching failure at the toe of the slab wall connection.,AikateriniGenikomsou,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-01,The student should have background in structural analysis; reinforced concrete design; finite element methods.

32403,Decentralized Learning for Computer-aided Diagnosis of Cancer,Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have created a wealth of novel research opportunities in developing new and fully automated methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies (e.g.; kidney cancer) in medical images. Despite recent intriguing success; AI-based methods still face challenges that impede their efficacy in medical imaging applications; including algorithms that are not well generalized to unseen data; limited image datasets; and annotations due to patient privacy concerns. While the hospitals have terabytes of data; its access is limited not only by the prohibitive time and cost to annotate images by the experts but also by privacy constraints (e.g.; need for Research Ethics Board approval for data sharing). Most of the deep learning (DL) models developed for medical imaging uses a centralized learning; where the entire dataset is required to be on a single site. Therefore; due to challenges in sharing medical data; datasets used to train the algorithms are quite limited (<200); resulting in the algorithms not being able to generalize to unseen data. In contrast; decentralized machine learning methods; such as federated learning and split learning; have the potential to address the patient privacy issue; as DL models can be trained without the need to share medical images externally. Instead; only weighting of the DL models can be aggregated on a central site. This way; more data at multiple sites can be utilized for building robust DL models for cancer detection. Since it is a fairly new research topic; applications of federated learning and split learning for medical imaging have been very limited and remains an open problem. In this project; the potential students will develop decentralized machine learning based methods (e.g. federated learning) to automatically classify medical images as cancer vs. normal. The students will then compare performance of decentralized to that of centralized methods.,EranUkwatta,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-06,The potential students are expected to have some prior experience in programming using Matlab and Python.

32404,Preliminary Development of Smart Alkali-activated Materials for Construction Applications,This preliminary research project focuses on the initial development of Alkali-Activated Materials (AAM) for construction applications; using industrial by-products such as fly ash and slag. These materials; activated by alkaline solutions; aim to provide eco-friendly and robust alternatives for the construction industry. This 12-week project will comprise three main phases. The first phase involves a comprehensive literature review on the alkaline activation process and its optimization techniques; with the goal to understand the balance between strength; resilience; and environmental sustainability. In the second phase; the intern will design and conduct simple laboratory experiments to create AAM using small-scale samples. This phase will allow the intern to gain hands-on experience in material preparation; and will also offer insights into the viability of using such materials in real-world construction scenarios. The final phase will focus on basic performance testing of the developed AAM. Although we won't integrate smart sensors due to the project's duration; the intern will be exposed to the concept and learn how it could be incorporated into future expansions of the project. The completion of this project will provide a valuable preliminary exploration into AAM for construction applications. The findings can lay the groundwork for future research in the development of Smart Alkali-Activated Materials (SAAM); revolutionizing the construction industry with sustainable and smart materials.,AdeyemiAdesina,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,The ideal candidate should be an advanced undergraduate or a graduate student pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering; Materials Science; or Environmental Engineering.

32405,Additive manufacturing of high entropy alloy,High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a type of advanced material composed of five or more metals in approximately equal proportions. They are characterized by their high strength; excellent ductility; and superior resistance to wear; corrosion; and high-temperature deformation. The manufacturing of HEAs traditionally involves methods like arc melting; induction melting; sintering; and casting. Additive manufacturing (AM) of HEA alloys for industrial applications is still a relatively new and developing technology; so more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and limitations. Current research includes studying the effects of different alloy compositions; process parameters; and post-processing treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of printed HEAs. High melting points of HEAs can pose a challenge for 3D printing which can make it difficult to achieve the right melting and solidification conditions needed to create a defect-free part. Additionally; the cooling rate during the printing process can affect the microstructure and mechanical properties of the HEA; which can impact the strength and durability of the final product. Furthermore; the printing process can introduce porosity or other defects in the HEA; which can compromise the mechanical properties. To mitigate these issues; we propose processes optimization during the AM of HEAs; which requires a multi-faceted approach; considering the various factors that contribute to the quality of the final product. This requires a detailed understanding of the relationship between the AM process parameters; the microstructure of the HEA; and the resulting mechanical properties.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student. Familiarity with metallographic characterization techniques; including sample preparation; polishing; and other related methods; as well as the ability to determine mechanical properties through testing techniques such as tensile; fatigue; and hardness; are also necessary skills.,Engg-Metallurgical
32406,Contact killing of COVID-19 by copper-based nanoparticles.,The primary goal of this proposal is to decipher the virucidal efficacy of carboxymethyl cellulose copper (CMC-Cu) nanoparticles against COVID-19 (formally named SARS-CoV-2). The studies will be performed in partnership with a Canadian company. Microbes are rapidly killed on surfaces of copper and copper alloys through a process named copper-mediated "contact killing". Furthermore; a recent study has revealed that COVID-19 is not viable upon exposure to copper surfaces. Of significance; copper concentrations required to kill microbes are not toxic for humans. Creating "self-disinfecting surfaces" by coating inanimate surfaces with copper is difficult to apply for practical and economic reasons. However; an exciting avenue is the recent discovery of CMC-Cu as an effective alternative to one-step disinfectant agent that significantly reduces microbial levels on surfaces and inanimate objects. Using an innovative method enabling production of MLV-based COVID-19 pseudotyped particles in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory; we will investigate COVID-19 unstability and its inability to attach and infect target cells in the presence of CMC-Cu in the absence of other reagent or in the presence of selected disinfectant products.,SimonLabbe,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Highly interested student who is eager to learn molecular and cellular biology as well as yeast genetics.

32407,Conception et réalisation d’un prototype d’hydrolienne instrumentée par prototypage rapide,La question énergétique et son impact sur le changement climatique sont une priorité mondiale. Des enjeux stratégiques ont été établis portant sur la diversification du bouquet énergétique; le développement des énergies renouvelables et la réduction des effets de serre. Dans cette optique; les hydroliennes font partie des énergies à fort potentiel et à grand challenge technologique. En effet; beaucoup de prototypes d’hydroliennes sont déployés pour essais et validations; des milliards de dollars sont investis depuis 10 ans mais peu de systèmes hydroliens sont industrialisés. Notre projet de stage de recherche se fond dans ces efforts. Il s’articule autour de 4 axes principaux : l’acquisition du savoir; le développement d’un prototype; l’instrumentation pour la validation et la maîtrise des techniques du prototypage rapide. L’acquisition du savoir se fera par une synthèse bibliographique complète des solutions hydroliennes existantes (fluviales et marines; à flux axial et transverse; avec et sans carénage…). Le développement d’un prototype englobe le choix d’une solution hydrolienne innovante; la modélisation théorique des efforts mis en jeu; la conception mécanique et électrique… L’instrumentation du prototype concerne la partie acquisition des données pour un post-traitement tel que l’énergie électrique à la sortie pour calculer et optimiser le rendement global de l’hydrolienne; la collecte des déformations dans les pales par des jauges de déformation pour une validation des résultats analytiques et un calcul de tenue en fatigue… la maîtrise des techniques du prototypage rapide concerne la fabrication des pièces constituant l’hydrolienne par impression 3D; un procédé qui permet de fabriquer des pièces complexes avec une bonne tenue mécanique d’une façon rapide et à moindre coût. Le projet comporte également un volet de modélisation et de simulation par éléments finis du couplage fluide-structure pour modéliser le chargement hydrodynamique et effectuer des études paramétriques lors de la phase de dimensionnement et d’optimisation des performances.,HatemMrad,Québec,Université du Québec en Abitibi–Temiscamingue,French,2024-05-01,Les stagiaires doivent avoir suivi une formation en génie mécanique et justifier une maitrise des outils de la conception mécanique (Solidworks; Catia; Adams …) et de la simulation numérique avancée (Abaqus; Ansys).

32408,Molecular basis of heme acquisition.,Heme has a wealth of functions in biological systems; making it an essential micronutrient for all living organisms. Defects in heme homeostasis are directly responsible for diseases; and have been tied to impaired development; metabolic syndromes and fungal virulence. Consequently; it is critical to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular bases of heme-dependent proteins in living systems. The research project will use a model system to decipher the interplay between important proteins involved in heme acquisition. Furthermore; inhibitors will be tested as potential anti-fungal drugs against heme-dependent proteins as they are required for invasion of fungal cells. Our studies use the model organism S pombe. This yeast; unlike S cerevisiae; can assimilate exogenous heme; allowing the use of the power of genetics to selectively block heme biosynthesis; setting conditions to investigate the mechanisms by which external heme is taken up by the cells. Our studies have revealed the existence of genes encoding proteins that have novel functions in heme assimilation; yet little is known about them; including their mechanism of action and how they are regulated in response to changes in heme levels. Students trained under this program will acquire education/training in multidisciplinary approaches; including areas of yeast genetics; molecular & cellular biology; biochemistry; next-generation sequencing & mass spectrometry. Students without distinction as to minorities will develop critical skills; allowing them to gain the status of highly trained scientists for the Canadian biotech sector &/or academic research community.,SimonLabbe,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Highly interested student who is eager to learn molecular and cellular biology as well as yeast genetics.

32411,Experimental Particle Physics: Study of Rare Kaon and Pion Decays with CERN Experiment NA62,NA62 at CERN and PIONEER at the Paul Scherrer Institut study rare kaon and pion decays. High precision measurements represent incisive probes of lepton and quark flavor physics. The reactions studied are sensitive to many new physics models not accessible by other reactions which extend the Standard Model (SM) to solve its considerable problems. The suppression of the rare decay branching fractions in the SM to the levels as low as 10-10 allows physics beyond the SM to contribute dramatically with large enhancements above SM predictions. NA62 expects to have sensitivity for observing 100 events at the SM level for ultra-rare process of a kaon decay to a pion plus neutrinos and studies many other rare or forbidden reactions to search for dark matter; heavy sterile neutrinos; neutral pion decays; and radiative processes. PIONEER is a newly developing experiment employing state-of-the-art technologies; studying rare pion decays with unprecedented precision to examine lepton flavor universality and quark mixing. Pion decays to electrons and muons will be compared to 0.01% enabling extraordinary sensitivity to new physics effects.

32414,Impact of Labour Mobility on the Physical and Mental Health of Skilled Trades Workers: Analysis of Burnout and Work-Related Stressors,There is a paucity of data in the literature about labour mobility and its effect on mental health. This project will work with employers and rural communities in Southwestern Ontario; to develop a scalable model for labour mobility that will match employers (in regions facing chronic on-going labour shortages) with employees from areas in Ontario facing high unemployment.

32415,Quantum dot optoelectronics for photonic integrated circuits,The explosive growth of global IP traffic drives the dramatic expansion of data centers with thousands of servers. It also brings the issue of significant power consumption. Integrated photonic circuit (PIC) technology is proposed and it can improve the performance of datacenter transceivers while reduce their energy consumptions. PIC technology is currently focusing on silicon photonics; which integrates light sources; optical modulators; and photodetectors onto silicon chips to realize ultrafast data transmission. The technology utilizes light with wavelength in near-infrared (NIR) region to transfer data. However; due to inadequate light absorption in NIR region; silicon is not a suitable material for photodetection in PIC. Instead; in PIC technology photodetectors are achieved by high-temperature epitaxial growth of expensive III-V materials or germanium on silicon substrate. We propose to develop both QD NIR sensors and lasers as photodetectors and light sources of PIC technology. Colloidal QDs are solution processable semiconductor nanomaterials; which can be obtained in low cost and large quantity. These QD-based devices have been reported for various optoelectronic applications; including light emitting diodes; lasers; photodetectors and solar cells. The research project aims to integrate QDs onto silicon chips; which will advance silicon photonics through combining QDs with state-of-the-art silicon technologies.

32416,Hypervalent iodine-mediated synthesis,One of the potential research projects available to summer interns concerns new fluorination reactions. Organofluorine compounds are important in medicinal chemistry; agrochemistry; and in medical imaging; and explorations of fluorinated compounds within these fields has ballooned over the past few decades. Developing new reagents and strategies for the synthesis of fluorine-containing building blocks; especially those not readily accessible using existing state-of-the-art methodologies; is economically and socially important; and it remains a critical research endeavor. We are developing new hypervalent iodine (HVI)-based fluorination reactions because they serve as sources of “electrophilic” fluorine; which provide an entry into chemical reactivity of the fictitious F+ ion. A benefit of this chemistry is that the HVI-based fluorination reagents differ from other electrophilic fluorination reagents; as they can lead to a variety of product types. (Difluoroiodo)toluene (TolIF2); is one such reagent; possessing two fluorine ligands on the iodine atom; with one being “electrophilic” and one nucleophilic. It reacts as a stable; solid alternative to fluorine gas. The efficient and highly selective fluorinating ability of TolIF2 is driven by the reduction of iodine (III) to iodine (I) which; when coupled with its easy and inexpensive synthesis; its mild reactivity and its environmentally-benign reaction conditions; holds significant potential for discovering valuable new fluorination reactions; especially for medical imaging probe development. Another option is the blue LED chemistry. Simple light-mediated reactions of iodonium ylides is an unexplored area of chemistry that has huge potential. Many new functional groups (alkenes; alkynes; heterocycles) can be tested in this reactivity; possibly leading to new; complex molecule syntheses. This is a new and very exciting area of my research program; and it offers a tremendous opportunity to learn new organic chemistry; and to develop new "green" synthetic methods that are recyclable and metal-free.,GrahamMurphy,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-13,The student should have taken at least one introductory organic chemistry course; and might have experience working in undergraduate chemistry laboratories.

Safety training will be mandatory; and will occur at the start of the internship.,
32417,Simulating Blockchain Systems,Blockchain technologies have been proposed to be promising vehicles for electronic transfer of value through trustless transactions between anonymous parties. Blockchain platforms rely on a network of nodes that maintain copies of the history of all transactions that have taken place within an social or economic system. Bitcoin is an example of a popular public blockchain. A variety of techniques are utilized to guarantee the desired properties of blockchain platforms; including consensus algorithms for ensuring that every node in the network has the same copy of the transaction history and mining algorithms for guaranteeing that generation of value tokens in the network is non-trivial and that the network is protected from various attacks. Blockchain platforms; however; can be notoriously complex systems and their development involves a substantial number of design decisions in order to ensure good fit to a specific purpose. In this project you will work on studying the design of proposed blockchain systems and contribute to the development an event-driven simulator using an engine that our group has already developed. The simulator shall be parameterizable with respect to important design and scaling decisions such as alternative consensus algorithms and configurations thereof; number of nodes; degree by which nodes are trusted; volume of transactions etc.. By running the simulator users should be able to acquire useful data on how a conceptualized blockchain implementation would behave with respect to parameters of interest such as transaction clearing time; global and local computational resources and exposure to attacks.,SotiriosLiaskos,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,Background. .

32422,Prototyping a smart mirror for polypharmacy,Nearly 70% of Canadian seniors over age 65 take five or more medications daily; and around 10% take 15 or more. Taking excessive amounts of medications; referred to as polypharmacy; can lead to adverse health effects; which include increased mortality rates; falls; adverse drug reactions; and increased length of stay at the hospital. Unnecessary and excessive medication consumption in seniors; which is the basis for polypharmacy; is directly proportional to the number of drugs; frequency of their use; and cognitive conditions of the user. There are many approaches to reducing polypharmacy; ranging from health professional interventions to supportive technologies - in this proposal; we focus on these technology-driven approaches. Smart devices have recently become more ubiquitous and are widely adopted for health monitoring. However; due to perceived complex user interactions; mobile phones; and wearables may present an increased cognitive load; an undesirable effect in seniors. As an alternative; we propose to optimize medication self-management using familiar; everyday objects to be smart and supportive technologies for reducing polypharmacy without placing increased cognitive demands on the users. Specifically; this research project focuses on prototyping a proof of concept of a smart mirror that reminds medication consumption for senior users by tracking a bottle when shown to a camera embedded in the mirror. The mirror presents a seamless user interface where the medication bottle becomes the unique input mechanism that produces visual information feedback regarding the time and intake dose. To understand the feasibility of this approach; we will conduct a design thinking session to capture user needs and conduct a preliminary study with content experts to understand the potential of the application. Finally; we will present a demo to an advisory/focus group to assess user preferences compared to wearable and smart mirror.,Alvaro JoffreUribe Quevedo,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-01,Programming and makerspace skills are highly appreciated.

With respect to makerspace; Arduino; Raspberry Pi; and computer-assisted modeling for 3D printing will strengthen the application.,
32423,Development of catalyst for syngas conversion in a sustainable matter,The conversion and capture of greenhouse gases; in particular CO2; have been investigated in several studies; considering their negative impact to the environment as well as their potential to produce high value-added chemical products. Therefore; CO2 hydrogenation remains the most widely adopted process for producing methanol; based on specific operating conditions and a suitable catalyst for improving reaction kinetics and promoting species selectivity. The purpose of this study is to develop a new approach for the synthesis of catalysts used in methanol production; via physical and chemical methods. There are a variety of catalysts reported in the literature for methanol production under different operating conditions; including temperature and pressure. In this context; we focused on the synthesis of binary catalysts containing ZnO and Al2O3 and ternary catalysts comprising CuO; ZnO and Al2O3 through physical synthesis (Plasma RF). These synthesized catalysts will be characterized by various techniques; including XRF; XRD; TEM; TGA and BET. By means of the techniques; the molar ratios; composition; morphology; reduction behavior and specific surface area of the catalysts will be studied. Then; these catalysts will be intended for a series of tests to evaluate their catalytic activities in a fixed-bed reactor to produce methanol from CO2 hydrogenation with the aid of response surface methodology.,FedericoGalli,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-15,Chemical engineering; laboratory and catalysis experience; data analysis,Engg-Chemical

The objective is to maximize the performance of this system; considering several constraints such as budget and minimum performance threshold. In this project; the system's performance (availability) will be evaluated using an efficient and fast method such as the UMGF method.

32426,Engineering of injection-moulded sustainable composites from waste textiles and non-recyclable waste plastics for new industrial uses,The collaborative research project will convert non-recyclable waste plastics and waste textiles into sustainable carbon and utilize hard-to-recycle plastic waste as the matrix to develop advanced composites for manufacturing of automotive parts. Of the 440 million tons of plastics the world produces annually; only about 9% is recycled. The rest end up in landfills; litter or are incinerated. Mixed plastics and multi-layer packaging are hard to recycle or not recyclable at all. Textile waste is one of the fastest growing sources of waste; fueled by the availability of cheap clothes and the global “fast fashion" phenomenon. Textiles contain a mix of synthetic materials such as polyesters and nylon often with cotton and wool. In this project; the Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre (BDDC) of the University of Guelph; which has pioneered the research of biobased carbon and composites; will utilize waste textiles and non-recyclable plastics to produce sustainable carbon through controlled catalytic pyrolysis. The synergistic co-conversion can greatly boost the carbonization efficiency and yield. The recycled plastics will be reinforced with the sustainable carbon to engineer advanced composites. The BDDC’s state-of-the-art injection moulding facilities will be utilized to create sustainable materials for a range of applications; including rigid packaging; consumer products and lightweight interior automotive parts.,AmarMohanty,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,• Undergraduate students in engineering; physics; chemistry; or other related fields of study with some lab experience through classes or the workplace. • Highly motivated to learn to prepare and test samples; and operate minor lab equipment independently. • Courses taken in Materials Science is highly desirable. • Knowledge in polymers; fibres; and composites is an advantage. • Excellent computer skills (Microsoft Office: Word; Excel; PowerPoint; etc.) • Excellent communication skills (Oral and written communication) • Detail-oriented data recording • Diligent in maintaining safe work protocols.,Chemistry; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Materials
32427,Eco-design of smart products: a methodological perspective,Digital and connectivity technologies have given consumers access to a large number of "smart" products. However; in the context of an evolving society and sustainable development; the question of the environmental impact of these products arises. These products integrate mechanical; electrical and electronic components; as well as digital and communications technologies; most of which require related infrastructures. All these components and infrastructures are likely to have significant environmental impacts. In parallel; previous work has shown that there is relatively little scientific literature on the application of eco-design practices to the development of smart products. This project postulates that these smart products and technological developments will continue; and that it might therefore be relevant to attempt to apply an eco-design approach to reduce their impacts. Although an applied aspect may be envisaged if time allows; the project essentially focuses on the methodological aspects of eco-design through an analysis of the scientific literature (literature review and evolution of the publications number). The literature review will confirm or refute the hypothesis that there is little literature addressing the application of eco-design to the development of intelligent/multidisciplinary products. This will provide an updated base of previous work.

32428,Policing Saskatchewan: Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) Youths Speak Out,Statistics Canada’s detailed analyses of the perceptions and selfreported experiences of diverse populations in Canada submit that the Black and Indigenous (BIPOC) populations are twice as likely to mistrust police. Particularly; BIPOC youths experience brutality; stereotyping and various other forms of discrimination at the hand of police officers. While this is a reality throughout the country; specific discriminatory practices from police officers have been experienced in several regions; such as the Canadian Prairies. Saskatchewan; a province on the prairie; has played a particularly negative role in Canadian history concerning policing and surveillance. Police brutality and discrimination have been exhibited repeatedly. One protocol has been the infamous Starlight tour; which involved picking up Indigenous men; women; and boys; then leaving them miles outside the city on subzero winter nights; leading to Saskatoon's freezing deaths. Police were also involved in the mishandled cases of many Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MWIW). Death cases are also directly linked to police brutality; racial discrimination and negligence in Black communities. These experiences; among others; are antithetical to the mission and vision of many police services in the country; which is to serve and protect. Although policing alone cannot solve public safety concerns and complex social issues; policing plays a significant role in how citizens from BIPOC communities and cultures are perceived. Little has been reported about racialized youths’ perceptions of the police in Saskatchewan. This research fills that gap; exploring BIPOC youths’ experiences and perceptions of policing in Saskatchewan and raising community voices through storytelling and audio drama. Research questions to explore include: 1) What are the experiences and perceptions of BIPOC youth on policing in Saskatchewan? 2) In what ways can the policing experiences and perceptions of immigrant BlPOC youth create space for dialogue on policing in Saskatchewan?,TaiwoAfolabi,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-06-03,Background in creative and artistic forms of expression and media is preferred. The student must be interested in topics of social justice; policing and racism. Good writing skills and interest in media and artistic research (qualitative) are required.

32429,Zero-waste alternatives to single-use plastics,The appeal of biodegradable packaging is an increasingly attractive solution for the management and disposal of plastic packaging. The benefits and limitations of biodegradable materials are important when we seek to understand biomaterials’ structure and properties; and their correlation with performances and their resulting environmental impact. This research focuses on responding to the market needs to find alternative solutions to the current petro-based multi-layer packaging that have comparable properties and cost effectiveness without the negative environmental impact. To overcome the negative environmental impact; the innovative materials must be demonstrated to offer acceptable biodegradability under a wide range of environmental conditions. The project is expected to support the development of innovative materials for single-use packaging applications. The research project will explore biodegradable resin compositions in high-melt strength flexible films and rigid sheets. To impart improved properties and/or added functionality in compostable materials for sustainable packaging; we will focus on reinforcements from a range of renewable materials.

32431,Designing AI-based Vision System for Improved Simultaneous Localization and Mapping,Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a promising localization technology for robots since it does not require any external localization infrastructure. Traditional SLAM algorithms build a metric map of the surrounding environment and estimate the location of the robot in the map based on the current sensor information. In addition to constructing a metric map; a line of recent research aims to extract semantic information (via computer vision techniques) from the environment; embed it into the metric map; and therefore improve the mapping and/or localization performance. The goal of project is to leverage the AI-based computer vision (CV) technology to incorporate high-level semantic understanding into traditional SLAM systems for better performance. The students will be designing and developing an AI-based CV system for a mobile robot running traditional SLAM algorithms; and then testing and investigating alternative design options.

32432,Building Resilient Futures: Analyzing Smart City Disaster Resilience through Agent-Infrastructure-Institution Networks,In today's society; the paradigm of urban disaster governance is shifting towards "disaster resilience" in the face of extreme climate change and social crises. The role of smart cities in empowering urban resilience presents a significant challenge in smart city development and governance. However; existing research often fails to bridge the gap between human agents and physical infrastructure in smart city resilience. Institutional frameworks for disaster resilience also lag behind real-world needs; resulting in significant investments with low effectiveness. To address these gaps; the research project establishes an agent-infrastructure-institution network; recognizing the holistic nature of smart city resilience. It aims to empower cities to adapt and thrive amidst extreme events and challenges; not just resist and prevent disasters. The project's analytical framework comprehensively understands the intricate relationship between agents; infrastructure; and institutions under potential disasters. It optimizes resource allocation and enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of resilience strategies in smart cities. The project builds an analytical framework to assess the disaster resilience of smart city systems; encompassing the agent system; infrastructure system; institutional system; and their interconnectedness. It applies this framework to evaluate the resilience of single or multiple smart cities; considering spatial and temporal characteristics. Additionally; it compares trade-offs between smart city investments and resilience; offering policy implications. Methods such as dynamic network analysis; multi-criteria decision making; systematic review; and qualitative analysis are employed. Through this research; valuable insights will be gained on enhancing smart city resilience. By bridging the gap between agents and infrastructure; improving institutional frameworks; and employing robust analysis; the project contributes to the development of resilient and sustainable smart cities. Ultimately; the findings will inform policies and investments; paving the way for urban environments that can withstand and prosper amidst diverse challenges.,HaiboFeng,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Given the multidisciplinary nature of the project; the ideal candidate may possess a combination of knowledge and expertise in various fields; such as engineering; public management; environment science; etc. Priority will be given to students with the following skills and backgrounds. 1.

32433,Predicting the energy performance and energy use of urban buildings in Vancouver,In Canada; the emission of building sector accounts for 12% of national emission; and those emissions are polluted form heating needs. Governments are taking action to improve the energy efficiency of buildings for supporting indigenous; rural and remote indigenous communities; including to develop model building code towards “net zero energy ready” and improve building energy efficiency and performance. Meanwhile; the Vancouver city; Canada is investing in climate-resilience buildings and infrastructure; such as the application of renewable. On this basis; students will be aiming at: 1. Apply geospatial techniques to quantitively predict future urban building energy systems considering different GHGs emission 2.

32434,Reduction of environmental footprint of wood buildings through performance-based design (PBD) -Rojini,The primary objective of the research is to assess the feasibility of timber buildings in Canada; with a specific focus on engineered wood materials such as CLT; Glulam; NLT; and others. The aim is to identify optimal structural solutions for each building element that minimize carbon emissions and ensure high structural stability; particularly in seismic areas. The research will involve conducting more than 30 structural analyses using software like ABAQUS/Opensees; as well as life cycle assessments using OpenLCA; to evaluate various wood building systems; including energy simulations. Due to the large number of models involved; manually performing all the simulations within the three-year research period is not feasible. Therefore; the study recommends automating the calculations by utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques. Tools like Dynamo or Grasshopper can be employed to consolidate all the analyses and results in a single platform; enabling the evaluation of different design changes efficiently. To obtain optimal results and develop a comprehensive framework; machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks will be applied for analysis and decision-making. Furthermore; the research will focus on assembling a robust carbon emission database specifically for timber construction; as there is currently a lack of such databases in Canada; except for areas like Quebec and Montreal. The database generated in this study will be open for use by other researchers and industry professionals; encouraging collaboration and the expansion of the database to include more cities across Canada.,HaiboFeng,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The student undertaking this research should have a strong knowledge of Building Information Modelling (BIM) software; such as Revit; and be familiar with tools like Dynamo or Grasshopper for automation purposes. Additionally; basic proficiency in Python coding for machine learning applications would be beneficial. The necessary sources and references will be provided to support the student in their research. While not mandatory; having a foundational understanding of structural engineering concepts would be advantageous for this study.,Engg-Civil
32435,Development of a computational tool for discovering potential cancer biomarkers,Early diagnosis of cancer can significantly improve the survival rate of patients. For example; when diagnosed early; the five-year survival rate of ovarian cancer patients was 93%; which dropped to 31% when the cancer was found at a late stage. Conventional diagnostic imaging tests suffer from insensitivity and inaccuracy; often requiring surgery to retrieve sample tissues to confirm the disease. In comparison; detecting cancer biomarkers in blood samples is much less invasive than surgery. The blood is enriched with biomolecules secreted from all over the body through body circulation. The candidate biomarkers contained in the blood can thus be potentially used for early diagnostics. However; one of the major bottlenecks for current blood-based cancer detection is the lack of efficient biomarkers. Multiple databases have been established to collect experimental data from cancer researchers around the world; however; there is a lack of bioinformatic tools to analyze those data for in-silico selection of cancer biomarkers in the blood. In this project; we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline for in-silico analysis and selection of potential biomarkers for detecting various cancers based on the technology we have established in the lab. Experimental data containing biomarker expression levels will be collected from several high-impact public databases and synthesized. Biomarkers with a high potential to distinguish cancer and normal samples will be selected. Multiple types of biomarkers; including proteins; nucleic acids; and exosomes; will be investigated for systemic biomarker identification based on multi-omics approaches. This project will pave the way for blood-test-based non-invasive diagnostics of cancer at an early stage; offering a helping hand to tens of millions of cancer patients in the world.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with general academic background in computer science; biological/biomedical engineering; computer engineering; software engineering; systems and technology engineering; or biology are welcome to apply.

32436,Development of low-cost multiplexed bioassays for early cancer diagnostics,Cancer is a complex disease and requires the study of multiple molecules to provide a more comprehensive view of its cause and nature. In light of its complexity; microarray technology has become a powerful tool in cancer studies. Thousands to tens of thousands of miniaturized bioassays can be conducted in parallel on a single chip; enabling high-throughput measurement of biomolecules. Among those molecules; proteins are of particular interest; because they are the nanomachines of life and can directly provide pathological information at the functional level. Antibody microarrays contain arrays of antibodies; with each spot ~100 micrometers in size. They have been used to measure tens to hundreds of proteins simultaneously. Although powerful; antibody microarrays are not widely accessible to most laboratories; largely due to the need for expensive equipment such as a fluorescence microarray scanner for fluorescence signal acquisition. To address this problem; we will develop a loc-cost antibody microarray-based assay; with the assay signals detectable using a conventional flatbed document scanner. The project will reduce the equipment cost by 50-100 folds; thus making the microarray technology widely accessible for most laboratories. A sandwich immunoassay format will be adopted for highly sensitive and specific protein measurement. Specifically; primary antibodies will be arrayed on a glass slide using a microarray spotter. Then; secondary antibodies will be applied after incubation of biological samples (e.g.; blood plasma). Several strategies for developing colorimetric signals will be investigated. The assay sensitivity and reproducibility will be compared with conventional fluorescence-based assays. This project will pave the way for low-cost microarrays; enabling their wider application in both research and clinical labs.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with a general academic background in biochemistry; biological sciences; biological/biomedical engineering; or chemistry are welcome to apply. The selected student is expected to have the basic knowledge to understand the chemical reactions involved in this project. The ability and willingness to learn the hands-on operation of the microarray for protein detection; including immunoassays; antibody microarrays and signal production; are desired. The student is also expected to be able to communicate effectively in a collaborative team environment.,
32437,Measuring exosomal proteins for early cancer diagnosis using a novel nano-sensor,Early diagnosis of cancer can significantly improve the survival rate of patients. For example; when diagnosed early; the five-year survival rate of ovarian cancer patients was 93%; which dropped to 31% when the cancer was found at a late stage. Conventional diagnostic imaging tests suffer from insensitivity and inaccuracy; often requiring a surgery to retrieve sample tissues to confirm the disease. In comparison; exosome is a type of emerging biomarker that can detect cancer early via non-invasive blood tests. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles ranging from 30-150 nm in size; secreted from all cells into the body circulation. The biomolecules (e.g.; proteins; nucleic acids; lipids) carried by exosomes are very similar to their cells of origin including those in cancer cells; and thus can be detected to report the presence of cancer. The relatively high concentration of exosomes in the blood provides them with the capacity for early cancer diagnosis. In this project; we will develop an assay for highly sensitive and accurate measurement of cancer-related exosome proteins based on a nano-sensor established in Dr. Li’s lab. Exosomes will be purified from blood plasma or serum samples using size exclusion chromatography. The concentration and size distribution of the purified exosomes will be characterized with dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy techniques. Next; various strategies to quantify exosome protein markers using the nano-sensor will be investigated for both exosome membrane proteins and intra-vesicular proteins. The assay sensitivity; accuracy; and reproducibility will be evaluated with biostatistics tools. Blood samples from ovarian and bone cancer patients will be tested to demonstrate the assay performance. This project will pave the way for blood-test-based non-invasive diagnosis of cancer at a very early stage; offering a helping hand to tens of millions of cancer patients in the world.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,No skills available,Biochemistry; Biological Sciences; Chemistry; Engg-Biological; Engg-Biomedical; Engg-Chemical
32438,Development of a new antibody array for multiplexed bioassays towards cancer diagnostics,Cancer is a complex disease and requires the study of multiple molecules to provide a more comprehensive view of its nature. In light of its complexity; microarray technology has become a powerful tool in cancer studies. Thousands to tens of thousands of miniaturized bioassays can be conducted in parallel on a single chip; enabling high-throughput measurement of biomolecules. However; conventional antibody microarrays have a size limitation of each micro-spot of at least ~ 100 μm in diameter. This size limitation restricts assay throughput and sensitivity; which is usually required for early diagnosis. We will develop and implement a micro-fabrication process to bring down the size limitation of antibody microarrays; achieving a 1-10 μm range for the size of each spot. Multiple parameters will be optimized to create uniform microarray spots with good spot morphology in large areas. After that; the fabricated antibody microarray will be used for highly sensitive multiplexed cancer protein quantification. The project will make the microarray technology suitable for highly sensitive cancer protein measurement; enabling its broader application for early diagnosis.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with a general academic background in biochemistry; biological sciences; biological/biomedical engineering; or chemistry are welcome. The selected students are expected to have the basic knowledge to understand or learn the microfabrication process and bioassays.

32440,On the biogeochemical cycle of selenium (Se): making the first ambient measurements of atmospheric Se,In this project; we will use proton transfer reaction time-of-flight (PTR-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS); Vocus S (TOFWERK; Aerodyne; Inc.) in conjunction with online gas chromatography (GC) (Aerodyne; Inc.); to measure Se in the atmosphere. Compared to the conventionally used ICP-MS for Se measurements; the Vocus allows for real-time measurements of atmospherically relevant analyte concentrations. Furthermore; the high mass resolution of this instrument in combination with the unique isotopic composition of Se offers the possibility for unambiguous identification of Se species of interest. With a focus on method development; our efforts are targeted towards lowering the detection limit for key selenium compounds like dimethyl selenide; dimethyldiselenide and dimethylseleniumsulfide. We could also elemental Se; SeO2; selenous and selenic acid and their sodium salts in the particulate phase using a specially designed inlet to the Vocus to evaporate the volatile Se components. Complimentary to these laboratory studies; the student will spend time to learn how to analyse mass spectrometry data; may have the opportunity to sample real ambient aerosol for Se content; and has the opportunity to discover new sources and sinks of Se in the atmosphere!,NadineBorduas-Dedekind,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-20,The student should be curious; determined and excited to work as team member. General chemistry knowledge will be useful; but can also be learned during the internship.

The student will be matched with a team of graduate students working with the same instrument who will help with the data analysis as well.,
32441,Lab-scale assessment of amended bioretention systems for emerging contaminant mitigation,This research project assesses the sorption and degradation of stormwater contaminants in bioretention systems using laboratory-scale experiments. This project aims to develop novel soil amendments that enhance contaminant degradation by producing reactive intermediates such as hydroxyl radicals; which rapidly react with emerging contaminants. The project will involve collecting and analyzing samples from bioretention columns in Dr. Scholes’ lab that contain soil amended for contaminant degradation. In these experiments; stormwater is introduced to the top of a soil column and filters through the soil. Periodic wetting and drying cycles; which result in variable redox conditions in the soil; will be simulated by varying the influent flow rates to the columns. The student will be responsible for maintaining the flow through the soil columns (making fresh influent solutions; checking pump flow rates) and collecting samples pre- and post-column treatment. The student will analyze samples for general water quality parameters (pH; dissolved oxygen) and concentrations of organic carbon; nitrogen; and iron. The student will work directly with a graduate student researcher to prepare samples for emerging contaminant analysis. The results of this experiment will be critical to advancing low-cost amendments for treatment of emerging contaminants in stormwater.,RachelScholes,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,The ideal candidate is an undergraduate student who has completed at least two years of coursework in environmental engineering; chemistry; environmental studies; or similar.

32442,Domain Adaptation for Regression Problems,While domain adaptation has been actively studied for classification problems; how to adapt regression models remains elusive. In this project; we will address several fundamental aspects of domain adaptation for regression. Ideally; the project will end up with a paper published at a top-tier ML/CV conference (e.g.; CVPR; ICML). The key strengths/objectives of our project include: -- We will leverage the tools from information theoretic principles to develop new theoretical insights for domain adaptive regression problems. In other words; we will adopt the principles of transfer learning to explain and motivate our algorithm. -- Our proposed framework will also support the robustness of label noise; which is ubiquitous in real-world applications. For regression problems; there exist two types of label noise: 1) data-dependent noise due to non-expert annotators or crowdsourcing-like platforms. For example; it is usually expensive to ask a doctor to annotate a large number of medical images; but it is possible to ask a number of medical students to label the images; with the risk that their labeling may be imperfect. 2) asymmetric noise due to the pseudo-labels assigned by the source model during the UDA process. We will design principled methods to address these issues,BoyuWang,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,You may be a strong candidate if you have (at least three of the following): - a strong background in statistics; linear algebra - knowledge of machine learning; optimization - published academic work on the topics of machine learning - sufficient programming experience (e.g.; Python; Matlab) - some experiences on advanced machine learning paradigms (e.g.; transfer learning; lifelong learning; meta-learning) - good English reading and speaking skills Disabled applicants will receive priority in case they have equal qualifications.,
32443,Knowledge Transfer in Artificial Intelligence Systems,Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques; especially deep learning; have advanced significantly in recent years; but their success relies on huge amount data; and they only perform well on the tasks for which they have been trained. To solve this issue; we will develop a comprehensive approach to knowledge transfer in artificial intelligence systems; addressing fundamental issues of safe transfer and adaptation to changing environments with guaranteed performance. The key strengths of our project include: -- Safe Transfer Between Diverse Tasks: Our approach will autonomously transfer knowledge between diverse tasks and models; supporting cross-domain transfer between tasks with different features/actions; and even transfer across learning paradigms (e.g.; using knowledge from classification tasks to inform regression). The formal notion of domain divergence will be developed and be utilized to provide guarantees on safety and performance. High-level task descriptions will be used to bootstrap rapid learning on new tasks; enabling zero-shot transfer. -- Modeling the Non-Stationary Environments of Tasks: Our approach will also model the non-stationary distribution of tasks in the environment; including support for gradual task drift and abrupt changes; allowing the system to adapt over its lifetime. These task distributions connect to all aspects of our approach; allowing the system to anticipate future tasks; generate a curriculum of learning tasks toward a given goal; and provide guarantees on expected performance. -- Applications: We will apply our methods to analyze brain signals in various scenarios. Our techniques are particularly compelling in these applications because collecting brain signals is usually expensive and time consuming. By knowledge transfer; we can leverage the experiences accumulated previously form other subjects/data sets to improve the performance for a new subject.,BoyuWang,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,You may be a strong candidate if you have (at least three of the following): - a strong background in statistics; linear algebra - knowledge of machine learning; optimization - published academic work on the topics of machine learning - sufficient programming experience (e.g.; Python; Matlab) - some experiences on advanced machine learning paradigms (e.g.; transfer learning; lifelong learning; meta-learning) - some experiences on EEG signal analysis (e.g.; signal processing; feature extraction; motor imagery/SSVEP-based BCI) - good English reading and speaking skills Disabled applicants will receive priority in case they have equal qualifications.,Computer Science; Mathematics; Statistics
32444,Quantum signal processing, Quantum image processing and quantum Fouier Transform,Quantum computing is a interesting process that uses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too large or complex for traditional computers. Quantum computers rely on qubits to run and solve multidimensional quantum algorithms. These days; researchers and companies around the world; specially Canada; are actively working on developing and refining quantum computing technologies. In this project we are working on aspects of quantum computing in quantum signal and image processing. Traditional signal processing deals with the analysis; transformation; and manipulation of signals; such as audio; video; or electromagnetic waves. In this project we are extending these subjects and the traditional techniques like filtering; modulation; compression; to extract useful information from signals by leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. One of the key advantages of quantum signal processing is the potential for exponential speedup in certain signal-related computations. For example; quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can efficiently compute the Fourier transform of a signal; which is a fundamental operation in signal processing. In this project; the students learn about Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Time permitting we explore more quantum transformations such as quantum wavelet transform; and quantum Discrete Cosine Transform and their potential applications in quantum computing related to quantum signal and image processing. The QFT is a quantum analogue of the classical discrete Fourier transform (DFT) which offers an interesting way to perform arithmetic operations on a quantum computer. We like to investigate applications of QFT in Shor's Algorithm;Quantum Phase Estimation; Quantum Data Compression; Quantum Signal Processing; Quantum Machine Learning; and Quantum Error Correction. For example in quantum data compression we like to know how QFT can be used for image compression. We also investigate how quantum machine learning algorithms can be applied to signal processing tasks; enabling more efficient data analysis and pattern recognition.,MohammadHassanzadeh,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,The student require to be good in Mathematics.

No other requirement is needed.,
32445,Machine Learning in Engineering,Machine learning (ML) focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In this project we aim to use ML algorithms in various applications; including image and speech recognition; natural language processing; autonomous vehicles; image and video processing; electric vehicles; power systems; environmental studies; supply chain; cybersecurity; computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomedical engineering. These algorithms are typically implemented using programming languages like Python; along with libraries such as TensorFlow; PyTorch; and scikit-learn; which provide tools and frameworks for developing and deploying machine learning models. For image processing we apply ML on image classification; object detection; image segmentation; image generation and image restoration. In the electric vehicles we work on range prediction; driver behaviour analysis and autonomous driving. In biomedical engineering we work on disease diagnosis and prediction; medical imaging analysis; and bioinformatics and genomics. In supply chain we use ML in demand forecasting; supply chain planning and scheduling; and warehouse Management. In CFD; we focus on application on automotive and airplane.

32447,Motion Planning and Robust Control of Autonomous Robots with Safety Guarantees,Recent dramatic advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies have increased the ability of robot perceiving and understanding their environments. While promising; AI systems receive criticisms from the control community for the lack of interpretability. The uncertainties in the output of AI systems (such as vision perception systems) becomes a major challenge for AI-enabled robot applications. Control engineering has a long history of providing both rigorous theory and implementable algorithms for guaranteeing the performance and robustness in dynamic and uncertain environments. In this project; the students will be engaged in the study of motion planning and robust control of robots in an unknown dynamic environment. Safety issues; such as collision avoidance; restricted zones; velocity limits; etc.; will be focused on in the planning and control of the robot. Students will learn how to read and understand literature in the field; how to design and develop an intelligent control system for a robot; and finally have an opportunity to work on a scholarly publication.,ChaoShen,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-06,The student needs to have undergraduate-level knowledge of systems and control; and have programming skills in MATLAB; C/C++; or Python. The student is preferred to have ONE or more of the following skills: knowledge of numerical optimization; software design skills; empirical research experience; or hardware design skills.

32448,Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds from Air Using Photocatalytic processes,Problem of air pollution is growing fast because of the emission of pollutants from industrial plants; exhaust of cars and change in our lifestyle due to more urbanization. Materials such as CO; NOx; SOx; and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are considered as principal pollutants of the environment with adverse health impacts on people. VOCs are one of the most commonly found pollutants in indoor and outdoor environments. Currently; there are five major methods for removal of VOCs including adsorption; photocatalytic oxidation; ozonation; non-thermal plasma and catalytic oxidation. A new and highly promising approach is to use a photocatalyst that facilitates reaction of UV with hydrocarbon air pollutants in air. This process is called Photocatalytic oxidation. Decrease in reaction temperature; saving in energy demand for air quality control and complete oxidation of VOCs to harmless by-products such as CO2 and water are the main advantages of photocatalytic oxidation of VOCs. The purpose of the present project is to compare the efficiency of catalytic ozonation of a mixture of VOCs (Benzene; Toluene; Acetone; etc.) at temperatures between 25 to 90 °C. For this purpose; transition metal catalysts developed in our laboratory will be used. A continuous reaction system is currently used in our laboratory to evaluate catalyst effectiveness and to study effects of operating parameters. Different stages of the experimental work involve the following steps: • Comparing the levels of ozone consumption and pollutant removal for a number of VOCs at different reaction temperatures • Performing equilibrium adsorption experiments to establish the effects of pollutant adsorption on the catalysts • Determining effect of water vapor on efficiency of the process The research project involves different scientific activities.

32450,Application of catalysts to enhance degradation of emerging pollutants in water using ozone,The presence of emerging pollutants (chemicals such as pesticides; residual pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in surface water bodies is becoming a serious concern not only for their environmental impact; but also for their potentially serious adverse effects on human health. Innovative water treatment technologies are under investigation to determine their potential application in current drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities in eliminating these emerging pollutants in water. In order to reduce the concentrations of emerging pollutants in water; reaction with ozone (O3) assisted by solid catalysts is considered a potentially viable process. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent that is produced from oxygen using available ozone generators. Since ozone is highly unstable in water; it is necessary to assess the efficiency of different catalysts that increase ozone stability and selectivity in its reaction with various emerging pollutants in water. The purpose of the present project is to compare the efficiency of ozonation in the presence of three solid catalysts (activated carbon; alumina and modified alumina developed in our laboratory) in terms of target compound removal and ozone consumption. A semi-continuous reaction system is currently used in our laboratory to evaluate catalyst effectiveness and to study effects of operating parameters. Different stages of the experimental work involve the following steps: • Comparing the levels of ozone consumption and emerging pollutant removal at different catalyst doses • Performing equilibrium adsorption experiments to establish the effects of compound adsorption on the catalysts • Determining time required for maximum pollutant removal based on kinetic parameters The research project involves different scientific activities. The student will work with a team of researchers in performing a variety of technical tasks in Catalytic Ozonation Laboratory.

32451,Using ultrasound for decomposition of emerging pollutants in water,The presence of emerging pollutants (chemicals such as pesticides; residual pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in surface water bodies is becoming a serious concern not only for their environmental impact; but also for their potentially serious adverse effects on human health. Innovative water treatment technologies are under investigation to determine their potential application in current drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities in eliminating these emerging pollutants in water. In order to eliminate emerging pollutants from water; advanced oxidation reactions and degradation with ultrasound can be used. In an ultrasound process; high frequency sonic waves are beamed into water. Interaction of sonic waves in water generates micro-bubbles within a very short period of time. Generation and destruction of micro-bubbles creates very high local temperature and pressure levels. Under these extreme conditions; thermal degradation can destroy any chemical compound. In addition; active chemical species (ions; radicals; ..) are generated in the reaction medium leading to reaction through advanced oxidation reactions. Combination of ultrasound and ozone (O3; an active allotrope of oxygen) can lead to development of water treatment process concepts based on ozonative advanced oxidation reactions. The purpose of the present project is to compare the efficiency of sonication in the presence of ozone for degradation of selected emerging pollutants in water. A semi-continuous reaction system which is currently used in our laboratory will be used for the process. Different stages of the experimental work involve the following steps: • Comparing the levels of ozone consumption and emerging pollutants removal under different sonication conditions • Determining time required for maximum emerging pollutants removal based on kinetic parameters and modeling of the process The research project involves different scientific activities.

32452,Application of adsorption, advanced oxidation and catalytic ozonation in removing antibiotics from water and wastewater,Presence of emerging pollutants (chemicals such as pesticides; residual pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in surface water bodies is becoming a serious concern not only for their environmental impact; but also for their potentially serious adverse effects on human health. Antibiotics are important class of emerging pollutants in nature. Presence of antibiotics in nature can lead to development of antibiotics resistant strains of bacteria. This is an important health concern. Innovative water treatment technologies are under investigation to determine their potential application in current drinking water and wastewater treatment process to remove antibiotics from water. In order to reduce the concentrations of antibiotics in water; reaction with ozone (O3) assisted by solid catalysts is considered a potentially viable process. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent that can be produced from oxygen using available ozone generators. Since ozone is highly unstable in water; it is necessary to assess the efficiency of different catalysts that increase ozone stability and selectivity in its reaction with antibiotics in water.

32453,Investigating the epigenetic factor LSD1 in the development of cancer,Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A) is a histone-modifying enzyme that removes methyl groups on histone tails; and by doing so regulates the expression of many genes important for cell proliferation. Aberrant expression of LSD1 has been shown in many types of cancers (neuroblastoma; leukemia; breast; lung or colorectal cancers) when compared with the corresponding healthy tissues. In the cells; alternative splicing of LSD1 gene produces a LSD1 transcript containing an extra exon (exon 2a). This LSD1+2a transcript encodes an LSD1 isoform protein containing a new domain of 20 amino acids. This LSD1+2a isoform is expressed in all cell types and represents approximately 30% of LSD1 proteins. We have identified the LSD1+2a isoform as potentially important for cell cycle regulation and chromosome segregation. The overall objective of the project is to understand the involvement of the LSD1+2a isoform in the development of cancer. Objective 1. Study LSD1+2a cellular functions. We will perform gain and loss of function experiments to explore the role of LSD1+2a in maintaining chromosome integrity through the cell cycle Objective 2. Characterization of the LSD1+2a interactome. We will characterize the LSD1+2a interactome during the cell cycle using mass spectrometry. Objective 3. Decipher the molecular functions of LSD1+2a. We will study the recruitment sites of LSD1+2a at the genome level and we will verify if LSD1+2a has an enzymatic activity similar to LSD1.

32454,Epigenetic memory of stem cells in aging,The transcription factors Oct4; Sox2; Klf4 and c-Myc can reprogram any somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Since this breakthrough; mixed findings have been published regarding the importance of the age for a successful reprogramming. Groups have reported that reprogramming efficiency declines with age while others have successfully generated iPSCs from senescent and centenarian cells. Important questions remain to be addressed: do the reprogramming process totally reset the aging clock (e.g. telomere shortening)? Do iPSCs keep a trace of their “past” in a more youthful state? Do iPSCs harbor an aged-related epigenetic memory which may impact their differentiation potential? This project will address directly these questions using iPSCs reprogrammed from somatic cells of different ages (20 to 80 years); and following the specific aims outlined below: Objective 1. To determine the aging clock. We will look the extent to which telomeres are elongated; telomerase activity is reconstituted; and mitochondria are reorganized in young- and aged-derived iPSCs. Objective 2. To decipher the aged-related epigenetic memory. We will analyse whether cell reprogramming maintains some specific epigenetic hallmarks of aging in iPSCs. Objective 3. To investigate iPSC differentiation potential. We will test the functional properties of young- and aged-derived iPSCs to differentiate into neurons.

32455,Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cellular reprogramming,The pioneer transcription factors Oct4; Sox2; Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) can reprogram any somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Since this breakthrough discovery; the molecular basics of the process are still not fully understood. The activity of pioneer transcription factors differs from that of conventional transcription factors as they bind directly to heterochromatin and trigger chromatin remodeling events leading to the opening of the chromatin. Important questions remain to be addressed to fully understand reprograming: is a specific expression level of these factors required to elicit the reprogramming process? How do these transcription factors have the ability to engage their target sites to open the chromatin? What genes are essential for engaging the lineage conversion? This project will address directly these questions following the specific aims outlined below: Objective 1. To determine the expression level of pioneer factors required to elicit the reprogramming. Using a OSKM polycistronic IRES-GFP construct; we will investigate whether a specific threshold is necessary to engage the reprogramming process. Objective 2. To identify the chromatin regulators associated with the pioneer transcription factors. We will determine whether the pioneer OSKM factors interact with specific chromatin-modifying enzymes and analyze the downstream events by ATAC-seq and epigenomic profiling. Objective 3. To investigate the genomic sites targeted by OSKM factors. We will perform ChIP-seq to decipher the gene regulatory network triggering the reprogramming process.

32456,Enhancing nerve regeneration using scaffold biomaterials,The peripheral nervous system (PNS) has the unique ability to regenerate damaged axons and rebuild functional connections. This functionality of the SNP relies on Schwann cells. However; functional recovery after nerve injury is generally poor in humans; as regeneration is usually limited to a few millimeters. The use of nerve guiding conduits (NGCs) was developed to bridge severed nerves and encourage axonal regeneration. Nevertheless; the current options are not optimal from a topological; mechanical and biological point of view to promote the growth of axons over long distances. We have developed a new biocompatible NGC with improved mechanical properties. Our general objective is to evaluate the potential of this microstructured biomaterial to improve nerve regeneration. Objective 1. Evaluate the impact of the biomaterial on cell survival and proliferation. We will study whether this NGC allows cell survival and proliferation and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by transcriptomic analysis. Objective 2. Investigate the potential for neuronal regeneration. We will assess whether our NGC provides suitable topography for neurite outgrowth using a culture model mimicking the PNS microenvironment. Neural precursor cells and Schwann cells will be generated from induced pluripotent stem cell lines for this purpose.,BenoitLaurent,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-05-06,The intern must have good knowledge in Cellular and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.

32466,CLEAN PLANT EXTRACTION SEQUENCING DIAGNOSTICS (CLEANSED) FOR CLEAN GRAPEVINES IN CANADA,Grapevine virus disease management has been identified by the grape grower and wine industries as a top priority for long‐term sector sustainability. Losses of over $23 million per year are currently incurred by grape growers due to reduced yield of infected grapes and increased fruit rejection by wineries. To replace the currently infected acreage and meet ongoing renewal of vineyards the industry needs access to 6.7 million domestically produced; virus free vines/year. There will be two separate pathways for implementation and commercialization. To accommodate these demands; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Sidney Centre for Plant Health (CPH) requires a rapid; cost effective genomic solution to replace the over 30 molecular and bioassays currently performed on ; which can take up to three years to complete. By implementing a high throughput sequencing method at the CFIA the costs of analysis will be reduced and analysis time will be reduced for industry priority varieties imported into Canada as well as audit testing from certified foreign sources destined to commercial planting. Reducing the testing time to 10 days allows grape growers to rapidly improve the health of their vineyards. Domestically; the Canadian Grape Certification Network (CGCN) is commercializing high throughput sequencing through its partner Cool Climate and Oenology Viticulture Institute for the certification of propagation material in nurseries and grapevines obtained through CPH; and for monitoring of production vineyards.,SudarsanaPoojari,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-07-01,molecular virology; plant virology; bioinformatics,Agriculture

32469,Smart bioinspired nanoparticles for crossing biological barriers,Despite the growing attempts to develop numerous nanoparticles for medical applications; limited impact was witnessed at the clinical level. This is due to the inconsistent behavior of developed nanoparticles once they are administered inside the body. This behavior is closely related to the change in surface properties of nanoparticles on their interaction with biological compounds found in the body such as proteins present in the blood. This would possibly result in a complete change of their engineered properties previously optimized on the bench. Several research groups are working to analyze the chemical components deposited on the surface of the nanoparticles once injected in the body. Yet; there is an inability to define the attributes and behaviours of these nanocomposites (nanoparticles with adsorbed plasma proteins) within the different biological environments.

32475,Unconventional RNA editing machinery,Our laboratory is investigating a unicellular eukaryote; known as Diplonema papillatum; because it carries out RNA editing and splicing in ways not observed in other organisms. Our general goal is to discover novel molecular mechanisms to enhance the molecular toolbox to be employed in diverse research fields from synthetic biology to medicine and environmental science.

The pre-RNAs undergo nucleotide substitutions [Cytosine-to-Uracil (C-to-U) and Adenosine-to- Inosine (A-to-I)] as well as additions of multiple Us. We discovered in the nuclear genome sequence a gene that is a good candidate for catalyzing the substitutions: a particular deaminase; called PPR-deaminase (PPRD); that is translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. We postulate that the PPRD; which is part of a novel multi-protein complex called 'editosome'; is a unique editing enzyme able to catalyze conversion of both C-to-U and A-to-I. Therefore; we isolated by immunoprecipitation a multi-protein complex that includes PPRD and determined the protein partners within this complex by mass spectrometry. The project proposed here aims at the further characterization of the postulated editosome by a complementary procedure leveraging covalent labeling by special biotin tags of all partners in proximity of the PPRD inside living Diplonema cells; which will subsequently allow us to purify the labeled partners. The particular objectives are: (i) identify the protein components of the editosome using this independent approach not requiring antibodies; (ii) determine if the editosome contains other molecules such as RNAs or DNAs; and if so; sequence them.,GertraudBURGER,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-06,basic molecular biology of proteins; RNAs; and DNAs (such as extraction; electrophoretic separation; blotting techniques),
32476,Detecting AI-Generated Health Misinformation on Social Media: A Cross-Cultural Project,Generative AI possesses the potential to serve as a significant tool for ordinary citizens; enabling them to create a vast array of digital content. However; it poses a major challenge: exacerbating the spread of misinformation. As Generative AI advances; it can produce highly realistic and convincing content; potentially misused to disseminate misinformation. This can sway public opinions and undermine trust; particularly when the source of the content—human or AI—is indistinguishable. The primary objective of this research project is to design a system that employs machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately; swiftly; and systematically detect AI-generated health-related misinformation on social media platforms. This system will leverage a combination of classification algorithms; sentiment analysis; and deep learning models to process and analyze social media data in English (Canada) and Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). The choice of these two languages ensures broad cultural representation; encompassing both Western and Eastern contexts. The respective political and legal environments in these jurisdictions; characterized by free speech and robust legal protections; offer a conducive setting for this research. This research proposal aims to contribute to the advancement of society-oriented AI research. By focusing on the intersection of AI; health; and communication; this project strives to address the complex challenges of generative AI in the contemporary digital age.,WillZhao,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-17,This project requires students with: 1.

32477,Exploring the Prediction of Stakeholder Satisfaction via Universities' Social Media Reputation Amid Crisis Periods: A Generative AI-Based Approach,This research project seeks to bridge the gap between informal social media feedback and formal measures of university experience amid crisis periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic; social media platforms serve as key channels for feedback; impacting universities' reputations. However; few studies link this feedback to formal measurements from national student experience surveys. The research methodology of this project involves 1) creating and utilizing a generative AI-based tool for swift and accurate sentiment interpretation from social media feedback about universities during 2020 - 2023; and 2) correlating this feedback with national university experience surveys' results in Canada; the US; and the UK through regressional analysis. The implications of our research are far-reaching. University reputation significantly impacts student recruitment; public support; and international development. During crises; anecdotal social media commentaries become more salient as a source of insights for higher education institutions' reputation management efforts. By highlighting the potential correlations between social media feedback and national survey results; the research can inform strategies to proactively address issues reflected in survey results; improve student experiences; and better manage institutional reputations. This project will also offer insights into the validity and reliability of national surveys during crisis periods and highlight the potential of social media as a triangulation tool for said surveys.,WillZhao,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-17,This project requires students with: - Data Science & NLP Understanding: A strong understanding of data science and NLP; as the project involves developing and applying a generative AI tool for sentiment analysis. - Social Media Analysis: Experience in analyzing social media data; managing unstructured data; and extracting insights.

32478,Deep learning for integrating multimodal data for precision medicine,Omics data refers to the high-dimensional and highly correlated data from genomics; transcriptomics; microbiome; metabolomics; and proteomics. Different computational and statistical analyses of these data can be used to identify risk factors for different diseases or to build autonomous disease prediction models. Analysis of omics data; imaging; and medical health records has become very popular in disease studies because such analysis is helpful to predict whether a patient has a certain disease or not. It is expected that integration of knowledge from multiple data sources measured on the same individuals should improve the prediction performance of patients with chronic diseases. Because one of these data sources may have biological knowledge that is absent in another one. However; due to the high-dimensional nature of the data sets with hundreds of thousands of variables and very small numbers of samples; traditional machine learning approaches (e.g. Support Vector Machines) have limitations to analyze these data efficiently. To overcome these limitations; the project will apply deep learning algorithms to learn knowledge from multiple data sources (omics; imaging; medical health records; etc.) at different feature levels; which will be used to predict disease outcomes and potential drug targets for the diseases. Specifically; the project will have these two objectives: 1) Apply deep learning algorithms to learn knowledge across data sources at a single feature level. 2) Apply transfer learning algorithms to learn knowledge across feature levels.

32479,Deep learning models for drug design,Traditional drug development strategy is costly; tiresome; and labor-intensive. In the last decade; artificial intelligence (AI) based deep learning (DL) technology has shown promising results to overcome some of these limitations. However; rapid DL- based development of de novo drugs with desire properties (Absorption; Distribution; Metabolism and Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET)) remains a challenging task. This study aims to address the de novo compound design with two specific goals: 1) develop a new and efficient DL model to predict ADMET of a given molecule; 2) develop a robust reinforced deep generative model to design compounds with desired ADMET properties. Reinforcement learning will encourage the generative model to design new drugs with predefined properties. The mitacs interns with computer science and or chemistry backgrounds will collect and analyze the publicly available data from peer-reviewed publications and in-house data to build the DL models. We aim to provide computational tools which are useful in reducing the time and the cost of finding high-quality compounds in the drug design process.

32480,Welfare and management of riding lesson horses,In 2010 over $400 million was spent on riding lessons in Canada with a growing demand. Over 10;000 lesson horses are in use in Ontario. Despite playing a key role; lesson horses are often subject to poor welfare conditions such as overuse; improperly fitted equipment and inadequate turnout. This impacts their mental and physical well-being with downstream financial; health and social consequences for both horses and humans. Live observations of lesson horse facilities will examine the influence of management practices on stress-related behaviours during riding lessons. At least 23 lesson barns will be visited to collect information on housing; turnout; workload and tack used during lessons. Horses will be individually assessed in a minimum of four separate riding lessons. Video footage will be taken before and after a lesson while being groomed and tacked up or untacked; and while being ridden to examine body condition score; heart rate; eye blink rate; rein tension and frequency of conflict behaviours. This information will allow us to examine relationships between husbandry practices and indicators of stress during working lessons. Lesson horses are the foundation of all areas of the horse industry and play a key role in human physical and mental health. Understanding the current state of active equid welfare in Canada can direct targeted educational efforts to ensure sustainability of this sector.,katrinamerkies,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a working knowledge and comfort around horses.

32487,Machine Learning for CyberSecurity,The modern world relies heavily on the correct operation of communication networks in general and the Internet in particular. Rogue actors regularly attempt to disrupt such networks; comprising confidentiality; availability; and/or the integrity of essential information. They are motivated by monetary gains (blackmailing the owners or operators of compromised systems) or political considerations (see Ukraine; Estonia; Georgia; etc.). Organizations and governments are therefore interested in hardening their systems; both by learning about possible attack vectors; and suitable defenses. This is typically expressed as a “game” between teams of “red agents” attacking a network and “blue agents” defending a network; ensuring continued operation and protection of confidential data. Traditionally; testing a network and hardening its defenses was a very labor-intensive process; with human teams playing the role of red and blue agents. Machine Learning has shown great promise to automate tasks that otherwise would require significant human insight/intelligence: image recognition; language translation; etc. Consequently; researchers have started to explore the capability of Machine Learning (ML) in the realm of cyber security. In our work; in close collaboration with a local government research lab and local industry; we are working toward building a training environment for such agents. An ideal training environment should have the following features: 1. It efficiently trains agents. 2. The agents are able to perform without change in a real network scenario. 3. Trained agents should perform (reasonably well) not only on a network for which they were trained; but also for networks that are similar (transfer learning). Students involved in this project will work on aspects of this overall project. Tasks could range from developing specific blue agents to participate in competitions; setting up and running evaluations in a variety of network scenarios; or exploring algorithms to reduce action or observation space complexity.,ThomasKunz,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,Students ideally would have knowledge about basic Machine Learning (feature engineering; hyperplane parameter tuning).

32491,Characterization of unaffected shoulder motion in upper limb prosthesis users,Body-powered prostheses are commonly used by individuals with upper limb loss. Since they are controlled using active body movements via a harness and cable system; much of the function of the affected arm is transferred to the unaffected arm. These movement changes may lead to increased pain and overuse in the unaffected shoulder. In spite of this; it is unknown how movement of the unaffected shoulder compares to that of the affected shoulder and to that in non-disabled individuals. The first objective is to compare the three-dimensional shoulder kinematics between unaffected and affected limbs during two standardized unilateral tasks when performed by individuals with a body-powered prosthesis. The second objective is to compare the three-dimensional shoulder kinematics of the unaffected limb in these prosthesis users to the kinematics of the non-task performing shoulder in non-disabled individuals. The trainee’s first task will be to become familiar with previously collected motion capture data for non-disabled and prosthesis user participants. The trainee’s subsequent tasks will include pre-processing the data; preparing the data for kinematic analysis; and analyzing the data. Three-dimensional shoulder kinematics will be calculated using the previously developed software Gaze and Movement Assessment (GaMA). Range of motion and peak angle measures will be extracted for three-dimensional shoulder kinematics for the unaffected limb and statistically compared to the affected shoulder in prosthesis users as well as to the non-task performing shoulder in non-disabled individuals. We hypothesize that prosthesis users may show compensations in the movement of the sound shoulder when using a body-powered prosthesis. Understanding the extent of movement deviations of the shoulder in the unaffected side may shed light on sources of overuse and be useful for improving the design of prosthetic technologies and their quantitative assessments.,AlbertVette,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-20,The student should have a background in Mechanical; Computer; Electrical; or Biomedical Engineering - or any related field.

32493,A real-time system for triggering muscle stimulation based on EMG measurements,Devices using functional electrical stimulation (FES) have been successful in re-training hand function following spinal cord injury and stroke. However; triggering of FES is still rudimentary: it is triggered by tapping the stimulation device with the other hand or by moving the head. In this context; current stimulation devices would highly benefit from a design feature that triggers FES based on the user's muscle activity. Such biofeedback would allow seamless and effortless triggering of stimulation. It has also been shown to be an effective therapy modality to re-teach function after neural injury. In this project; we aim to develop a prototype for triggering FES based on electromyography (EMG) measurements. Specific aims are to: 1) Identify potential strategies for triggering FES based on EMG measurements; both in terms of hardware requirements and EMG processing algorithms; 2) Develop a real-time; microcontroller-based environment (e.g.; Arduino) for EMG-based triggering of FES; and 3) Test and characterize different EMG processing algorithms when triggering FES. Using previous work on real-time EMG processing; the main objectives are to ensure accurate; robust; and real-time delivery of the FES trigger while minimizing costs. This project is expected to benefit the Canadian industry and healthcare system. It will also allow us to train future biomedical engineers in biomedical instrumentation; real-time control; and bio-signal processing.,AlbertVette,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-20,The student should have a background in Mechanical; Computer; Electrical; or Biomedical Engineering - or any related field.

32494,Quantitative assessment of unstable sitting control using a smart balance board,Balance problems are very common post-stroke. In the early stages of stroke recovery; people are often unable to stand; which limits a therapist’s ability to assess the effects of stroke on balance control and predict future capacity for independent mobility. Motivated by its prognostic relevance; also upper body control during sitting has been used to assess balance impairments post-stroke. While the ability to sit can be assessed very early in the rehabilitation phase; maximal sitting balance scores are oftentimes observed; resulting in a major ceiling effect. One possibility to avoid floor or ceiling effects is to assess a modified sitting posture using a novel sitting paradigm that is safe; but more challenging than conventional sitting. For this purpose; we developed and validated an instrumented (smart) wobble board capturing its tilt angles during unstable sitting. Our objective is to implement the smart wobble board in a clinical setting and validate the obtained kinematic data. I) The trainee's first task will be to embed the smart wobble board into an existing test environment. More specifically; the trainee will need to synchronize the smart wobble board with other experimental equipment and develop a software interface; allowing the user to store and visualize the acquired tilt angles on a tabloid. II) The trainee’s second task will be to validate the kinematic data. First; tilt angles during unstable sitting will be cross-checked against those obtained via a conventional motion capture system. Second; mechanistic measures of postural steadiness; obtained from the tilt angles; will be compared between non-disabled young individuals and non-disabled elderly individuals. Third; the reliability of the obtained measures will be explored by having half of the non-disabled study participants return for a second assessment session. The trainee will execute the experiments; assess kinematic validity; and identify differences between the age groups.,AlbertVette,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-20,The student should have a background in Mechanical; Computer; Electrical; or Biomedical Engineering - or any related field.

32495,Validation of an ankle torque sensor to quantify force generation dynamics,Recent developments in the field of neurorehabilitation suggest that functional electrical stimulation (FES) may have the potential to facilitate standing and walking in people with spinal cord injury. However; the time delay from muscle stimulation to torque generation (= torque generation delay) might threaten postural stability and needs to be accounted for by envisioned closed-loop FES control strategies. In order to determine the torque generation delay for one of the most critical joints during stance control; the first objective of this project is to develop a load cell-based sensor device that can measure isometric ankle torques at different joint angles. The second objective is to use the sensor in healthy individuals to quantify the torque generation delay as a function of muscle activation frequency and amplitude.

32496,What gene should be targeted to kill cancer cells?,In an effort to facilitate development of anti-cancer drugs directed at specific molecules; we have turned to exploiting the interactions between gene pairs that can cause lethality. Particularly; we take advantage of an approach called Synthetic Dosage Lethality (SDL); where an overexpression of a gene is lethal only when another; normally non-lethal; mutation/deletion is present. Since cancer cells often overexpress genes due to the effect of gene amplification; or other epigenetic modifications; discovering SDL interactions could reveal new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Importantly; normal cells would be unaffected as the gene whose expression is lost; is not essential for its survival. We use the genome-wide pooled shRNA gene knockdown technology as well as genome-wide; pooled CRISPR system to systematically probe ~18;000 human genes to identify SDL interactions. Using this information; we aim to build a genetic map; akin to the “Google Map” of the cancer cells and design novel cancer therapeutics. Havent heard of CRISPRs? Come chat with me or just google CRISPR. Bottomline; our unbiased approach to query every single gene in the human genome to find what genes become essential for the survival of the tumor cells will potentially identify a target to kill cancer cells. We now have a few potential candidates that we are testing using the CRISPR technology. Your role will be to take a potential candidate gene and test if loss of function of this gene sensitizes the malignant cells.,FrancoVizeacoumar,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,All that is required of the student is the motivation. If you have a science background and willing to work hard; then you are game. I will be happy to mentor a motivated student. One of the important criteria is that they should pay attential to details and have trouble shooting skills.,

32498,Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Routing Anomalies,The long-term objectives of my research program are to develop new algorithms for information routing in complex networks; such as the Internet. Of particular interest is to advance theory and understand the underlying behavior of the complex system representing a packet network based on empirical traffic data collected from communication networks. The program encompasses: analysis of data collected from deployed networks; characterization and modeling of network traffic anomalies; and novel algorithms for routing protocols in complex data networks. Formal analytical and statistical methods and machine learning tools for traffic characterization and estimation of network performance are being developed. A library of new tools and models is made available to the research community. My projects deal with detecting routing anomalies that affect BGP performance. Examples of these anomalies are worms such as Slammer (January 25; 2003); Nimda (September 18; 2001); Code Red (July 19; 2001) and ransomware WannaCrypt (May 2017) and WestRock (January 2021). BGP anomalies also include Internet Protocol (IP) prefix hijacks; miss-configurations; and electrical failures such as Moscow blackout (May 25; 2005) and Pakistan power outage (January 22; 2021). We use statistical (Hidden Markov and Naive Beyes models) and machine learning techniques to classify and detect network traffic anomalies and intrusions. Machine learning algorithms under consideration include Support Vector Machine; Recurrent Neural Networks (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)); and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) (XGBoost; LightGBM; and CatBoost) algorithms. Effect of feature selection algorithms on the accuracy of the classifiers is also of importance to developing the best performing models. Future investigation and development include evaluation and application of semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. Various anomaly detection models are developed using Python tools and libraries. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop an online web-based research prototype for detecting network traffic anomalies.,LjiljanaTrajkovic,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,The student should have research interest in machine learning.

32499,Homotopy Methods for Circuit Simulations,Finding a circuit’s dc operating points and its periodic steady-state are very important to the IC design community. The SPICE simulator can be used to find the steady-state response of circuits only by performing transient analysis over a long period of time and the designer needs to ensure that the circuit settles into its periodic steady-state. This approach is often inefficient and; in some cases; not suitable for simulating RF circuits. Therefore; the periodic steady-state circuit response is simulated directly using either the time-domain Newton-Raphson shooting method or the frequency-domain harmonic-balance method. The time-domain Newton-Raphson shooting method is preferred for simulating highly nonlinear circuits. However; an appropriate set of initial conditions is required for its convergence. This is a challenging problem when simulating oscillators; where the period of oscillations is not known a priory. Homotopy methods are robust and accurate numerical techniques for solving nonlinear algebraic equations. These methods have been used to find dc operating points of nonlinear circuits (HomSPICE) and for their steady-state analysis (HomSSPICE). The initial implementations proved promising for finding periodic steady-state solutions of non-autonomous and autonomous circuits that could not be otherwise simulated. HomSPICE and HomSSPICE are derived from SPICE and HOMPACK (a numerical package that implements homotopy algorithms). HomSSPICE is a tool for exploring the use of globally convergent homotopy algorithms for the periodic steady-state analysis of both autonomous and non-autonomous circuits. The simulator is shown to have robust convergence for a variety of sinusoidal oscillators. The proposed project deals with using homotopy and continuation methods to solve differential algebraic equations emanating from analysis of electric circuits. HomSSPICE and HomSPICE software packages employing these methods have not been made publicly available. We are interested in completing the new generation of these tools and releasing them to the research community.

32500,Wildfire smoke infiltration inside buildings,Air pollution causes 15;300 premature deaths every year in Canada; but this number could be increasing due to stronger; more numerous and more frequent wildfires; especially in Western Canada. While we have minimal control over outdoor air pollution during wildfire smoke events; personal and collective building management practices; including manual (e.g.; closing windows and doors) and more sophisticated interventions (e.g.; HVAC systems; portable air cleaners); could drastically reduce infiltration of wildfire smoke inside buildings. This research project entails an extensive data collection of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations outdoor and indoor residential and infrastructure buildings in Victoria; BC; and Edmonton; AB. Indoor-outdoor ratio will be analyzed to identify the amount of PM2.5 entering those buildings. Building configurations (e.g; HVAC parametrization; age; window types) will be considered to explain differences in infiltration of PM2.5. Based on observations and statistical analyses; the most influential factors will be unveiled; and solutions for minimizing infiltration of smoke inside buildings and mitigating population exposure to air pollution during wildfire events will be proposed.,LauraMinet,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,The student is expected to have a strong interest in air pollution.

32501,Microbial bioremediation of oilsands mine tailings,This project will examine bacterial communities in tailings ponds in the Alberta oilsands. The oilsands are one of the world's largest petroleum reserves; but the oil is highly degraded and viscous; making it difficult to extract. The chemical extraction procedures produce a large amount of toxic fluid waste or tailings; which are stored in engineered tailings ponds. The major environmental problems associated with these ponds are that they contain a large amount of biotoxic organic compounds that should not be released to natural water systems; and that they produce large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The goals of our research program are: 1) To assess the coupled processes of methane production and methane oxidation in tailings ponds with molecular microbiology methods 2) To determine how methane emissions might be minimized from these systems 3) To determine if methane-eating or methanotrophic bacteria contribute to bioremediation. These bacteria have low-specificity oxygenases that co-degrade other hydrocarbons while oxidising methane. They are considered useful in remediation of diverse pollutants.,PeterDunfield,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,The student should have an interest in environmental microbiology and bioremediation.

32503,Reading Leigh Hunt Anew,James Henry Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) was one of the most prolific and influential writers on British culture and politics in the first half of the nineteenth century. He was an essential member of the literary circle that included Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley; Charles Lamb; William Hazlitt; Lord Byron; and John Keats; and he knew everyone from William Wordsworth and Henry Crabb Robinson to Charles Dickens and Thomas Carlyle. "Reading Leigh Hunt Anew" will investigate in great depth Hunt's interactions and networks. Because Hunt's career involved a number of literary and political circles and genres which are usually treated in isolation; a new study of the range of his critical work during his career will provide valuable insight into the links between the Romantic and Victorian movements and the growth of an expanded and more socially diversified audience for critical essays and serious literary journalism. Although he is now most often remembered as the editor of the radical weekly newspaper "The Examiner" (1808--22) and the leader of the 'Cockney School of Poetry'; Hunt's contribution to Romantic literature was as wide-ranging as it has proven to be durable; in matters as various as prosodic experimentation and the modernization of the magazine essay. "Reading Leigh Hunt Anew" consists of two tightly interrelated projects on Hunt; one of the key figures of the Romantic period in England; known for his work as editor; journalist; poet; and facilitator. The first is an online database devoted to Hunt's critical writings called "The Leigh Hunt Archive"; which will enhance accessibility and usability of Hunt's works (along with an experimental exhibition component). The second part of this research program is a new book entitled "Reading Leigh Hunt's Critical Essays Anew through Digital Humanities Tools".,MichaelSinatra,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,Students should have a background in literary studies; and/or some technological knowledge in digital humanities.

32505,Formulation and characterization of hybrid nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery of messenger RNA,Although vaccines prevent millions of infections every year; the development of new effective vaccines against global killers like AIDS; tuberculosis (TB); and COVID-19 is challenged by the demand for induction of cell-mediated and mucosal immunity to protect the host; e.g.; CD8+ T cells that can kill infected cells at mucosal sites of pathogen entrance. Most licensed vaccines are administered by injection and protect the host exclusively via induction of antibody (Ab) responses in the blood; but they do neither induce cell-mediated nor mucosal immunity. A revolutionizing novel approach is to vaccinate with in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA carrying the molecular instructions for in situ synthesis of antigenic protein directly in the host. This versatile vaccination technology induces both strong Ab and cellular immune responses but depends fully on delivery technologies to transport mRNA across the cell membrane to ribosomes in the cytosol. However; the design criteria for a multifunctional and safe mRNA delivery system that delivers mRNA to the cytosol and concomitantly induces protective mucosal CD8+ T cell immunity are elusive. Hence; the purpose of the project is to decode these highly fundamental design criteria. To this end; we have invented a unique RNA delivery technology based on lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (hybrid LPNs) with an unprecedented ability to deliver nucleic acids to the cytosol. In addition; we have identified molecular components (immunostimulating compounds) needed to induce strong CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. We hypothesize that these hybrid systems both deliver mRNA encoding antigen and induce T cell responses in the airway mucosa; which is the site of infection for several respiratory pathogens. We will use microfluidics manufacturing to precisely control the particle properties and to ensure the scalability of the production process.,AneeshThakur,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,1.

32506,Tangible user interface for hand washing exergame,Reminiscence Therapy (RT) is a non-pharmacological treatment focused on helping individuals with dementia to recollect memories through their senses. Traditionally; the therapy has relied on multimedia where caregivers choose videos; pictures; and audio files. Since cross-sensory stimuli play an important role during RT; the use of tangible user interfaces resembling daily activities such as hand-washing that can be reused for other activities (e.g.; cooking; gardening) adds more immersion when combined with audiovisual feedback from a computer interactive media application (e.g.; a game; exergame; or serious game) using standard monitors or virtual reality headsets. This project focuses on prototyping a tangible user interface that will allow for circular and linear movements to enable user interactions integrated into a handwashing exergame. Off-the-shelf virtual reality and computer input devices typically comprise mouse/keyboard; gamepads; and virtual reality controllers; interfaces that lack proper representation of daily tasks and can greatly impact the user experience by reducing the cognitive load required to operate them.,Alvaro JoffreUribe Quevedo,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-01,Programming and makerspace skills are highly appreciated.

32507,Analytical modeling of timber-concrete composite structures,Timber-concrete composite (TCC) is an innovative and high-performance construction material which combines the best properties of timber and concrete. Using shear connectors; the two dissimilar materials work together as a whole; resulting in enhanced features such as higher stiffness and load-carrying capacity; reduced vibration; and improved acoustic and thermal properties. Some of the applications of this innovative material in structural engineering are renovation and strengthening of old timber structures; construction of modern mid-rise buildings; and construction of mid- to short-span bridges. Proper design and performance assessment of TCC systems require development of accurate analytical tools applicable to different structural elements; shear connector configurations; and loading conditions. The existing analytical procedures are mostly based on 1D beam models in which the composite behaviour is oversimplified; or use 3D models which are computationally expensive and require extensive calibrations. More importantly; the existing methods are mainly focused on the flexural response of TCC systems and neglect the shear behaviour which in some cases can result in catastrophic failures. The objective of this research project is to develop a unique analytical procedure for TCC systems which can overcome the above-mentioned limitations. With this procedure; the composite behaviour will be represented by coupling a well-recognized rotating crack model for reinforced concrete with a fixed-orthotropic material model for wood. Special considerations will be given to properly model the effects of interfacial slip between the two materials. The new hybrid (rotating-fixed) analytical procedure will be implemented in a three-dimensional finite element analysis tool previously developed for reinforced concrete structures. The effectiveness of the proposed analytical procedure will be verified by modelling a wide range of timber-concrete composite specimens reported in the literature. The Globalink student will be working with graduate students in the development; implementation; and verification of the new hybrid model.,VahidSadeghian,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,1) Highly motivated to work on research topics related to structural engineering. 2) Strong academic background specially in structural analysis and design courses. 3) Strong English language skills. 4) Having critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.,
32508,Development of sustainable earthquake-resistant 3D printed concrete buildings,3D printed concrete (3DPC) has the potential to revolutionize construction practice by using robotic technology to automate construction. With this novel technique; concrete is precisely placed in thin stacked layers using a computer-controlled extruder to build up a structure. This technique saves time and money; increases worker safety; and provides more design flexibility. Similar to any other new technology; 3DPC presents new challenges that need to be addressed before it can be utilized on a large scale by the industry. One major challenge is the lack of knowledge on the performance and safety of 3DPC buildings under natural hazards including earthquakes. The existing analytical and experimental studies on the structural performance of 3DPC are very limited and do not provide information on the response of 3DPC structures under complex loading conditions (e.g.; dynamic loading). Considering the vulnerability of our communities to earthquakes; it is extremely important to thoroughly assess and improve the seismic safety of 3DPC structures. A collaborative research program is currently underway between Carleton University; IIT Madras and IIT Guwahati to develop sustainable seismic-resistant 3DPC buildings by conducting experimental testing and computer simulations. 3DPC structural specimens with different concrete mix designs and reinforcing methods will be tested to develop structural designs that; for the first time; are resilient against earthquake loading. This will be done using innovative hybrid simulation methods (combining computer modelling with physical test specimens) and shake table tests. Using the test results; analytical models for predicting the response of 3DPC buildings will be calibrated and verified. These analytical models will then be used to conduct parametric studies to better understand the influence of each design variable on the structural response. The Globalink student will be helping graduate students to conduct experimental tests; calibrate and verify analytical models; and perform parametric studies on 3DPC structural elements.,VahidSadeghian,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,1) Highly motivated to work on research topics related to structural engineering. 2) Strong academic background especially in structural analysis and design courses. 3) Strong English language skills. 4) Having critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.,

32514,Price Transmission through Vertical Supply Chain in Produce Markets,This research project investigates price pass-through for the vertical supply chain (farm - wholesale - retail) in produce markets in the presence of two structural shocks: 1. Foodborne illness outbreaks: The World Health Organization estimates that every year almost 600 million people are affected by foodborne illnesses and 420;000 people die. A local example of a foodborne illness is the 2019 E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in romaine lettuce. Consequently; consumers care about foodborne illnesses and are interested in gathering information after a foodborne illness outbreak to determine the risks associated with consuming said product. Also; consumers have more exposure to information on foodborne illness outbreaks than ever before due to the reach of social media; news popups on smartphones and direct emails from the purchase point (e.g. Superstore) that track purchases using memberships and points cards (e.g.; PC points). The research in this application extends the measure of consumer exposure termed ‘food safety index’ introduced by Camoglu; Serra and Gil (2015) and applied by Durborow; Chung and Kim (2016). An extension is necessary because previous authors incorporate only newspaper coverage. (2) Food Price Inflation: Unlike foodborne illness outbreaks; food price inflation is experienced by everyone. The United States Department of Agriculture reports that food-at-home prices increased by 3.5; 3.5; and 11.4 percent in 2020; 2021; and 2022. The forecast for 2023 is 6.6 percent. These percentages can be compared to the average of 1.69 percent for the decade starting in 2010. This research investigates the price pass-through for the recent period of high inflation and questions whether inflation is equally shared between the farm; wholesale; and retail levels of the vertical supply chain.,JanelleMann,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,The student must have the ability to learn new skills and have an interest in working with broiler chickens (feeding; watering; and weighing).

32516,Understanding how software developers use AI-based Code Generation Tools,In recent years; numerous code generation tools powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged; such as Amazon CodeWhisperer; DeepMind AlphaCode; Facebook InCoder; GitHub Copilot; OpenAI Codex; Tabnine; Replit GhostWriter; and others. These tools leverage vast amounts of source code and natural language texts to suggest matching source code for a given input prompt. The proliferation of these AI-based code generation systems presents an opportunity to revolutionize software engineering practices. Over the past year; more than 1.2 million developers have utilized a popular AI-based code generation system; relying on it for nearly 40% of their code written in popular programming languages. Consequently; understanding how developers employ these tools to accomplish programming tasks is crucial.

32517,Regulation of oncogenic tyrosine kinase receptors signalling,Signalling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are essential for organogenesis and homeostasis. In humans; activation of RTKs at inappropriate locations or times can have disastrous consequences such as cancer. This has made many RTKs prime targets for drug development. Signals from RTKs are often relayed via effectors containing modular protein binding domains; which are instrumental for the assembly of multidimensional signalling networks. Adaptor proteins are prototypical examples of such effectors. Adaptors serve as hubs to recruit appropriate target proteins and to guide signals along specific pathways. They allow a relatively small number of receptor-ligand combinations to produce a wide range of outcomes depending on cell type and environment. However; the molecular mechanisms underlying such diversity are poorly defined; as it remains unclear how different RTKs share the same adaptor proteins; yet recruit various combinations of regulatory proteins to produce outcomes specific to each RTK. We discovered a novel mechanism by which RTKs terminate downstream signalling while still remaining on the plasma membrane in a catalytically active state (Molecular Cell 2018). We found that this mechanism is independent of receptor recycling and rather involves the direct phosphorylation by RTKs of SH3 domains. This phosphorylation occurs on an evolutionary-conserved Tyr present in the majority of the >250 human SH3s of signalling proteins. This published finding led us to hypothesize that RTKs utilize tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3 domains on downstream effectors to dynamically sculpt the composition of the signalling complexes that they nucleate when activated. The proposed research project will focus on the definition of the selectivity and efficiency of RTKs towards SH3 domains (Nature Communications 2021; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 2022).,NicolasBisson,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The student must have a basic knowledge in biology; with at least some laboratory experience.

32518,Analysis of EPH tyrosine kinase receptor cellular signalling networks using 3D cellular models,Intercellular communication is a critical feature of multicellular organisms. In that respect; cellular response to extracellular stimuli is mediated by signalling pathways that act downstream of transmembrane receptors; such as the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). With 14 members; the Eph family of RTKs (EphR) is the largest in vertebrates. They are divided in two groups; EphA (ten members) and EphB (six members); based on similarity of their extracellular domains that also correspond to their preference for binding the membrane-anchored ligands; the ephrins. EphR-ephrin signalling is important for a variety of biological functions; such as cell adhesion; shape and motility. Most of Eph family receptors are found to be overexpressed or deregulated in a variety of human tumors; especially in the more aggressive and lethal ones. Unfortunately; the complexity of EphR-ephrin signal transduction in normal and cancer cells is far from being understood. The overall goal of the project is to identify new downstream effectors of Eph-ephrin signalling using proteomics and to determine their roles in the regulation of cell adhesion; migration and invasion. This approach will lead to the identification of new key players in Eph-ephrin signalling; as we recently discovered (Cell Reports 2022; Clinical Cancer Research 2023; Cell Reports 2023). This will further provide invaluable insight on the mechanisms by which Eph receptors and ephrin ligands regulate biological function. In the long-term; this work may also lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.,NicolasBisson,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The student must have a basic knowledge in biology; with at least some laboratory experience.

32521,Functional analysis of NCK adaptor proteins as building blocks for cellular signalling,The response of cells to extracellular stimuli is mediated by signalling pathways that act downstream of membrane bound receptors. These pathways are commonly organized through inducible protein-protein interactions and have been highly conserved throughout evolution. Signals from receptors are often relayed through adaptor proteins; which serve as hubs to recruit appropriate target proteins and guide signals to specific cellular pathways. The main goal is this research program is to decipher how normal cells use these adaptor proteins to coordinate specific responses from a given extracellular cue. In the case of tyrosine kinase receptors and phospho-tyrosine signalling; this is exemplified by adaptors composed exclusively of SH2 (Src Homology 2) and SH3 protein interaction domains; such as NCK1 and NCK2. NCK1/2 adaptors mediate the interaction between phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) containing proteins (via their single SH2) and effectors that contain poly-proline motifs (via one of their 3 SH3s). Little is known about NCK1 and NCK2 specificity as both adaptors are generally considered to be indistinguishable. We have shown using protein interaction analyses that NCK1 and NCK2 signalling networks contain both common and unique components (Mol Cell Proteomics 2018). Recently; we have demonstrated that SH3 domain position within their host protein (in particular NCKs) is crucial for their interaction with targets (Nature Communications 2021; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 2022). The proposed project aims at defining how NCK1/2 adaptors achieve specificity towards their targets. The identification and characterization of NCK1- and NCK2-specific targets will be instrumental to understanding how two adaptor proteins that appear identical nevertheless achieve specific functions in multiple aspects of cellular organization. Moreover; our studies will shed new light on SH2 and SH3 domains as protein interaction modules that mediate assembly of signalling complexes; and how they control the coordination of cellular responses.,NicolasBisson,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The student must have a basic knowledge in biology; with at least some laboratory experience.

32522,Investigating Ecology & Population Decline in Seabirds in Quebec, Canada,Seabirds are the most rapidly declining bird group worldwide. Canada; with the longest coastline in the world; hosts significant numbers of seabirds; especially in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Seabirds in the Gulf are exposed to many factors including oil spills; fisheries; chemical/plastic pollution; changing prey stocks and increased predator populations. Over the past two decades; numbers have declined across the Gulf; including in the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve. The research project will focus on understanding the causes of seabird declines by examining demographic rates and movement at-sea from a mixed-species colony in Mingan. Successful candidates will join a multidisciplinary team conducting monitoring of seabird populations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence; Quebec; Canada. Research will be lead by Carter Rouleau (Ph.D. student at McGill University); Dr. Raphael Lavoie (Biologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada); and Dr. Marie-Claude Roy (biologist with Parks Canada). The project is based out of McGill University; but all fieldwork is conducted in Mingan Archipelago National Park; along the northern shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Our team is involved in a number of long-term monitoring and conservation initiatives within the park; including movement tracking; ecotoxicological analysis; and the use of artificial nesting structures. These monitoring techniques are applied broadly to the many seabird species that inhabit the islands; but a the team will be focused on some particular research objectives. In 2024; research will primarily focus on two species-specific objectives: use of artificial nesting structures by lesser auks (Alca torda); and an investigation of population decline in black-legged kittiwakes (Lissa tridactyla).,KyleElliott,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-06-03,Ideal candidates for this project will have a background in ecology; environmental biology; or evolutionary biology.

32523,Do plant species that co-occur compete less intensely than those that never co-occur?,Some pairs of plant species are regularly found growing closely (positively co-occurring); while other pairs are never found growing close together (negatively co-occurring). It has been hypothesized that intense competition is what leads to some pairs never being found together. I propose to work with a Mitacs Intern to test this by measuring the intensity of competition experienced by plant species when grown with another species with which they negatively co-occur; as well as the intensity of competition experienced when plant species are grown with a species with which they positively co-occur. If negatively co-occurring pairs of species compete more intensely; this will be consistent with the hypothesis that competition is keeping those pairs of species from being found growing close together in wild plant communities. Competition intensity will be measured in a greenhouse growing experiment; where the intern will grow plants alone and with a competing species (positively or negatively co-occurring). The difference in growth of a plant when growing alone and with another species is an established protocol used to determine the impact of neighbour competition on plant growth.,BrandonSchamp,Ontario,Algoma University,English,2024-05-01,1.

32524,Exploring the Shadow of Resilience: The Negative Effects of Forced Resilience on African Immigrants in the Canadian Labour Market,Resilience; often hailed as a positive and empowering trait; plays a pivotal role in individuals' ability to overcome adversity and achieve their goals. However; the potential negative consequences of forced resilience have received relatively less attention. This research project aims to delve into the dark side of resilience; specifically focusing on African immigrants in Canada. Despite being praised for their resilience; this population faces challenges in integrating into the Canadian labour market and achieving economic stability. By examining the potential harms of excessive reliance on resilience; this study seeks to shed light on how this widely advocated approach may hinder rather than facilitate the success of African immigrants. Through a careful analysis of their experiences and the barriers they encounter; we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding resilience and its impact on marginalized populations. Ultimately; this research calls for a nuanced examination of resilience strategies to ensure a more equitable and effective response to the challenges faced by African immigrants in Canada.,CharlesGyan,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-06,The ideal student intern should have a strong research aptitude with some knowledge of research methodologies.

32525,Endosomal sorting regulation by a Rab GTPase,Membrane trafficking is an essential mechanism conserved from yeast to humans; and mutations in a large array of trafficking regulators are associated with human diseases. Endosomal sorting events control the destiny of endocytosed transmembrane proteins by directing them towards either recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation at lysosomes. Sorting events are coordinated by the retromer; the retriever; and the commander complexes. These bind specific cargo to ensure their recycling. All these complexes also associate with the WASH actin polymerization complex to control endosomal F-actin polymerization. Hence; WASH plays a central role in cargo sorting as well. However; how the WASH complex activity is regulated is still an open question. Our laboratory has identified the small GTPase RAB21 as a WASH interactor and a potential modulator of WASH activity. This MITAC internship aims to identify the binding regions between RAB21 and WASH complex subunits through in vitro and in vivo binding assays. Once the interaction sites are mapped; the student will generate binding-deficient mutants and perform localization and functional studies in cells. Together; these experiments will test the relationship between the WASH complex and its new regulator; RAB21.,SteveJean,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,- Wet lab experience. - Cell culture and fluorescent imaging experience is a plus. - Experience with western blotting. - Capacity to perform biochemical experiments (protein interaction mapping; activity assay; etc.) would also be a plus. - Being relatively independent and having initiative. - Motivated,

32527,Is ceftiofur in horses associated with colonization with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria?,This research project is aimed at determining whether horses treated with ceftiofur become colonized with antimicrobial resistant bacteria. To that extend; we plan on collecting nasal swabs and fecal samples from horses at the time that they are prescribed ceftiofur from a veterinarian working in our equine field service clinic. Seven to 14-days after the completion of the ceftiofur therapy; a second nasal swab and fecal sample will be collected. All samples will be processed in the microbiology lab to determine bacterial population; with specific attention to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus and 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli. Appropriate isolation of these pathogens on selective media (incl. biomedical testing) and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility will be done. Genetic determination of resistance genes will also be performed. Samples will also be collected from healthy horses that do no receive ceftiofur and will be processed in the same manner. Participating horse owners will be briefly queried about their management practices and whether their horse has received antimicrobial treatment in a specified time period prior to sample collection. Complementary to this prospective field study; a retrospective study will be conducted by querying antimicrobial prescribing practices of veterinarians working at the equine clinic. Data will be gathered by querying the hospital's medical records system.,FabienneUehlinger,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,Suitable applicants must have adequate spoken and written English language skills to communicate effectively with the rest of the research team and clients.

32530,Correcting for silent data corruptions using structured sparsity and machine learning,With their ever-growing scale and sophistication; modern computational infrastructures are increasingly susceptible to Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs). SDCs are `soft’ faults. They are liable to go unnoticed and propagate across a system; causing significant errors in downstream computations. It is therefore critical to develop new mechanisms to mitigate against SDCs in large infrastructures. The goal of this project is to develop new theoretical foundations and novel state-of-the-art algorithms for tackling SDCs in scientific computing applications. We will interpret SDCs as intrinsically low-dimensional objects embedded in high-dimensional spaces - namely; those living on or close to certain nonlinear manifolds. This powerful lens through which to view corruptions opens the door to using sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques to deal with them. This work will combine ideas from sparse modelling; high-dimensional geometry; compressed sensing; continuous optimization; machine learning and deep learning to this end. We will first develop new mathematical models for SDCs and then use these to design a new generation of fast; reliable; scalable and theoretically guaranteed algorithms for SDC detection and mitigation. This project will involve three main objectives: 1) New; structured sparse models for SDCs with associated theoretical guarantees. In this objective we will develop and study new ways to model SDCs that refine existing low-dimensional models. 2) New algorithms for detecting and mitigating SDCs based on fast; scalable first-order optimization methods. Having obtained new models in 1); in this objective we will look at how to exploit such models through structured regularization and fast optimization algorithms. 3) Novel; robust; data-driven SDC algorithms based on deep learning with breakthrough performance. Finally; in this objective we will address the case where one has access to historical SDC data. We will use this to design and train effective deep neural networks for accurately and robustly detecting SDCs.,BenAdcock,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,This project will involve a combination of mathematics and programming.

32531,Genetic interactions between autophagy and various signaling pathways in the intestine,The intestinal epithelium constantly faces various types of stress from ingested food. Mutations in genes regulating the process of autophagy are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Autophagy is defined as the lysosomal degradation and recycling of cytosolic components. Our laboratory uses Drosophila melanogaster to investigate how autophagic dysfunction affects the gut. We found that autophagic defects lead to increased intestinal inflammation and shorter fly lifespan. Using an unbiased genetic screen; we identified genetic modifiers of loss of autophagy. We now want to characterize the relationship between these pathways and autophagy. In this MITAC internship; the student would perform multiple drosophila crosses to test the impact of co-depletion of autophagy along with specific pathway regulators. Adult fly guts would be dissected and stained with various markers to assess the different cell populations. Stained guts would then be imaged by confocal microscopy; and the image would be analyzed using specific image analysis software. We believe this work will identify pathways that could be targeted in affected individuals to improve intestinal homeostasis.,SteveJean,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,- Wet lab experience. - Knowledge of Drosophila genetic. - Knowledge on confocal imaging and image analysis. - Being relatively independent and having initiative. - Motivated,
32532,Contribution of alternative splicing to myofibroblast,Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism that expands the proteome diversity by allowing the transcription of multiple messenger RNAs from a single gene. Numerous examples have illustrated the functional impact of alternative splicing in the literature. There is also a high level of understanding of the major factors influencing a splicing decision (e.g. RNA sequence in cis and RNA binding factors acting in trans); recently culminating into a "splicing code". However; there is not much known about the upstream mechanisms controlling the expression/activity of splicing factors and even less linking extracellular factors to alternative splicing regulation.

32533,Mécanique des fluides dans les microturbomachines - études expérimentales,The main objective of the project is to experimentally characterize the microturbines we have manufactured. In order to continue their development; we must put the microturbines to the test and measure its performance. We also want to investigate its behavior in order to compare with the predictions made during the design phase. For the aspects that are not predictable; we also want to explore the behavior experimentally to better understand its operation; its limits and the achievable performances. Aspects that can be studied in this way include: low Reynolds number fluid mechanics in turbomachinery (Re<3000); viscous flows in the micropump; compressible flows in hydrostatic and hydrodynamic bearings; heat transfer by conduction and convection; as well as rotor dynamics at the microscopic scale. Many of these aspects remain unexplored to date; given the novelty of millimeter-scale microturbines. At this small scale; it is difficult to insert instrumentation to measure the flow; so we use simulation (CFD) to better understand the internal flows. Experimentally; we measure inlet and outlet values; such as flow rates; pressures; and temperatures; as well as rotor speed and vibrations. To achieve this; we have developed specialized fixtures with control and data acquisition systems for microturbines. The objective of the internship is to conduct experiments to investigate the behavior of the microturbine; including not only the turbomachinery; but also the flows in the pump and bearings. Improvements to the test bench will also be useful to better understand the behavior of the microturbine.

32536,Evaluation, Refinement, and Application of Crack-based Safety Assessment Models for Concrete Bridges,Most existing bridge inspection guidelines assess damage and degradation severity of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge structures in a highly qualitative manner using visual inspection benchmarks such as measured concrete crack widths and lengths. While visual inspection procedures can provide a great deal of information pertaining to the performance of in-service bridges; the findings from these inspections are somewhat dependent on the experience/interpretations of the inspectors. In recent years; several assessment procedures have been proposed in an effort to use measured concrete cracking to develop objective and quantifiable insight into RC structure performance. However; in most cases these procedures require measured concrete cracks to be discretely modeled within a finite element analysis software which is extremely costly and impractical for real-world assessment. A team of researchers from Carleton University and the University of Waterloo has recently initiated a collaborative research project to develop simple and practical assessment tools to enable engineers to accurately assess the severity of structural damage in concrete bridges based on information measured during visual inspections. The project consists of conducting a comprehensive literature review of existing damage-based evaluation procedures and identifying typical bridge components that would benefit from structural crack evaluation. A visual crack measurement evaluation database recently developed by the research team will be expanded and subsequently utilized to evaluate the performance of the existing crack-based assessment procedures. Based on the findings of the evaluation; a refined crack-based assessment model will be developed and employed to assess the condition of a real RC bridge structure in Canada. The Globalink student will be working with graduate students to carry out the literature review; collect data on the condition of structural components of existing bridges in Canada; expand the visual crack measurement evaluation database; evaluate and refine the crack-based assessment models; and apply the models to real-world structures.,VahidSadeghian,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,1) Highly motivated to work on research topics related to structural engineering. 2) Strong academic background especially in structural analysis and design courses. 3) Strong English language skills. 4) Having critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.,Engg-Civil
32537,Conducting polymer binders in new battery chemistries,Lithium-ion batteries are reaching their intrinsic capacity limit. They are based on lithium intercalation for charge storage; which requires a solid framework host material that can be oxidized and reduced and stores lithium ions reversibly. By reducing the volume and weight of the solid framework; the energy density and specific energy of lithium ions can be increased. However; there is a limit to this optimization. With the newest generation of lithium intercalation materials; structural collapse can be observed upon cycling. Alternative batteries; that could potentially store more than ten times the energy that lithium-ion batteries store; are based on electrochemical reactions that are less reversible than intercalation chemistry. This leads to a strong performance decay with time. The reason for this is often connected to the electrode matrix; that cannot accommodate volume and morphological changes of the charge-storing materials. Our research has discovered new electrode matrices (patent pending) based on conducting polymers and adhesive polyanions. We have demonstrated their ability to serve as complete one-component matrix in lithium-ion batteries. These matrices have the potential to unlock reversible performance of a wide range of new battery chemistries. In this project; you will be applying these new electrode matrices to one of a choice of new battery chemistries: lithium-air; lithium-sulfur; lithium-tin; lithium-silicon; Na-ion; Mg-ion; Ca-ion; Al-ion; Na-sulfur. You will be exploring the stability and chemical interactions of the matrix with its active materials. This is an exciting opportunity to prove that high-performance alternatives to lithium-ion technology are within reach; by optimizing the battery electrode composition and matrix.,ChristianKuss,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,You should have a background in materials chemistry; electrochemistry or functional material engineering and excitement to contribute to solutions to our fossil fuel dependence.,Chemistry; Engg-Materials; Engg-Chemical
32538,Scaling of Solvent Enhanced Oil Recovery Processes using Reservoir Simulation,There has been substantial interest in Alberta in using solvents for oil recovery to minimize the use of steam for in-situ oil/bitumen recovery. Understanding upscaling of solvent processes is still in its infancy as is understanding the mechanistic behavior of solvent recovery from oil/bitumen reservoirs. Reservoir simulation has been used in other processes to study scaling and scaling parameters. This project will begin with a brief literature review of research done in this area. The project entails setting up reservoir simulation models; likely for homogeneous and possibly heterogeneous reservoirs at various scales; and then implementing these simulations using a thermal compositional reservoir simulator; STARS. The principal investigator will aid the student in setting up the simulations unless the student has this expertise. It is likely that the research will focus on gravity drainage processes only. The output from the simulations will be analyzed and compared to determine the scalability of the process. This research will be used to determine the viability of using reservoir simulation to explore the scaling of this process. If time permits; the researchers may further explore the use of externally applied heat to the same reservoirs considered in the earlier part of the study. Also; if time permits; the researchers may explore the effects of various operating parameters; such as injection pressure; production pressure and mass transfer coefficients such as diffusion and dispersion.,ShelleyLorimer,Alberta,MacEwan University,English,2024-05-01,The student should be interested in petroleum engineering; preferably with some background derived from petroleum courses. The student should be comfortable working with a computer and analyzing large amounts of data. The principal investigator is willing to provide some training in reservoir simulation; however; if the student does have some experience in reservoir simulation that will make progress on the project much easier. The student will have to be able to work independently and troubleshoot the running of the computer software. The student should also be familiar with Microsoft Office to write up the results of the analysis.,
32539,An Investigation of the Scalability of Commercial Solar Panels/Photovoltaic Cells,A brief literature review will be conducted on the scalability of solar panels from small to medium size; to compare the energy that can be generated and used with the long term goal of predicting output from large scale solar projects. Several commercial solar panels will be investigated and data collected in the summer 2024 in Alberta. This particular project will be a continuation of what is perceived to be a longer term project to study the use of solar panels in northern climates. The energy output for these two panels will be recorded for later analysis; along with the "usability" of this technology based on the perceptions of the researchers. These results will be compared to information which is published in the literature to determine the feasibility of using commercial solar panels both from an economic perspective and from individual residential use of this commercial technology. A preliminary research review has suggested that solar energy "might be able to" produce significant amounts (67-100%) of electrical energy in a residential community in Calgary. This research is intended to extend knowledge in this area with a focus on the practical application of existing solar technology.,ShelleyLorimer,Alberta,MacEwan University,English,2024-05-01,The student will need to have a basic understanding of sustainable energy methods. An understanding on the use of solar panels in northern climates would also be beneficial. The student should have a comfort level with a basic programming language.

32540,Multi-junction Third Generation Photovoltaics Technologies,In the past few decades; third generation QDs solar cells (QDSCs) have become the most cost-effective alternatives to commercial silicon solar cells due to their eco-friendly; low-cost materials and simple fabrication process. In particular; QDSCs have the potential to break the Shockley-Queisser limit (33%) of the PCE due to the unique optoelectronic properties of the colloidal QDs as light harvesters. However; the record value of PCE (~16%) for QDSCs is still far from their predicted theoretical efficiency due to the limited range of solar light absorption associated with architectural designs and non-radiative carrier recombination within the device. Therefore; in this project; we aim to develop a multi-junction architecture that covers the solar spectrum light absorbance and optimized layered photoanodes with reduced carrier recombination to reach record-breaking power conversion efficiencies. Although it's quite challenging to design QDs that harvest the solar photons from visible to NIR region. We will resolve this issue by fabricating the photoelectrode by using the specially synthesized colloidal eco-friendly QDs of different sizes (or bandgaps) in a layered configuration and optimizing the device's architectural design. In addition; each layer is precisely designed according to the compatibility of interconnective layers. In this approach; the chemical; thermal and electrical synergy between the two layers will be controlled. These special multi-junction solar cells offer the possibility of achieving the PCE of 42% and 49% for tandem and triple-junction configurations; respectively. The results of this project will bring about a revolutionary transformation in global PV technology by enabling widespread access and easy distribution of low-cost; lightweight solar cells that can be seamlessly bonded to any surface.,Gurpreet SinghSelopal,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-17,The required background of the student is in the field of Materials Science; Chemistry; Electronic Engineering; Physics; and Nanomaterials.

Background in electrochemistry and electro engineering will be more specific of the project related with the operation features of the solar cell and the characterization of its main parameters.,
32541,The Functional Connectome: Hallucinations and Delusions,The neuroimaging focus of the proposed work will apply advanced multivariate methodology to comprehensive; internationally shared data sets in order to generate new insights into these intermediate networks as they relate to the symptoms of in schizophrenia; thereby contributing to a biological understanding of hallucinations and delusions. Attempts to understand networks must be based on connectivity at some level; and this has led to international efforts to share data in order to define the set of connections in the human brain. This has been coined the Human Connectome Project; where “connectome” refers to the connection matrix of the brain. When the object of study is functional neuroimaging data; this endeavour is referred to study of the functional connectome. Our laboratory has identified task-based functional brain networks; and a subset of these have been involved in all tasks we have analyzed; and we have developed an automated algorithm to classify new networks into these templates. We have also associated a cognitive function with each using powerful methods of combining datasets; and observing activity over a range of cognitive tasks. For example; one network activates during volitional attention to external representations; another during volitional attention to internal representations; one responds to extraction of semantic information (linguistic and other); and another activates when checking/evaluating a previous response. The current project involved a data sharing initiative whereby functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from multiple sites will be simultaneously analyzed to identify functional brain networks underlying hallucinations and delusions. We are also combining fMRI and EEG data in order to identify the overlap between networks involved in both; and which are impaired in schizophrenia.,ToddWoodward,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Computer programming skills/multivariate statistics are not really required for this internship; but are helpful. A desire to learn about and apply these methods to the study of human behaviour is required. Valuable skills that would provide an excellent starting point for a career in cognitive neuroscience research will be obtained. However; plenty of opportunities also exist for students advanced in computer programming; brain imaging and multivariate statistics. Most importantly; the intern must be easy to get along with; able to work well with a team and be able to find the right balance between working independently and asking for guidance.,Biology; Neuroscience; Psychology; Statistics
32542,Photo-reforming of Non-Recyclable Plastic Waste into Clean Chemical Fuel,Our major dependency on plastic-based materials is generating several serious global environmental and health problems. Plastic in the form of micro and nano-plastic is continuously entering and increasing its contents into the human food chain system through crops; animals and ocean organisms that have multiple harmful effects on human health. Additionally; the synthesis of plastic polymers demands a high amount of energy supply; which is provided by fossil fuels. According to a recent survey; if all available plastic waste were recycled; then we could save $176 billion every year18. Thus; the mismanagement of plastic waste recycling not only creates environmental/health issues but also significantly affects the economic value. The commonly available approaches demand a relatively outrageous amount of energy input while releasing enormous greenhouse gases along with clean chemical fuel. In this context; solar-driven reforming of plastic waste into clean chemical fuel (i.e.; H2) is an attractive and "green" alternative to tackle plastic waste under ambient conditions. However; the conversion efficiency of photoreforming of plastic waste into clean chemical fuel is quite low which prohibits the commercialization of this promising technology. The objective of this project is to design a novel hybrid photocatalyst by using eco-friendly zero-dimensional (0D) colloidal core/shell QDs in combination with ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductors to develop high-performing solar-driven reforming of non-recyclable plastic waste into clean chemical fuels under ambient conditions. This specially designed eco-friendly 0D core/shell QDs (i.e.; ternary I-III-VI2 and quaternary) offer broad light absorption; and ferroelectricity polarization switching of 2D ferroelectric nanoflakes enhances photogenerated carrier separation and injection to improve the performance of solar-driven reforming.,Gurpreet SinghSelopal,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-17,The required background of the student is in the field of Materials Science; Chemistry; Electronic Engineering; Physics; and Nanomaterials.

32543,Eco-Friendly Semiconductor Nanocrystals for Multicolor and Multistage Anti-Counterfeiting and Encryption,With technological advances and economic growth; counterfeiting of industrial products (e.g.; banknotes; documents; jewelry; medicines) has become a global problem. It poses financial and security risks to individuals; industries; and governments. The counterfeiting market was $107 billion in 2016; growing at 14% annually; projected to reach $206 billion by 2021. Strategies like holographic labels; inks; RFID tags; watermarks; magnetic coding; and plasmonic labels impede detection and duplication. Ideal anti-counterfeiting tech should be affordable; non-destructive; unclonable; mass-producible; and easy to authenticate. Therefore; the objective of this proposed project is to develop cost-effective and highly fluorescent security ink based on semiconductor nanocrystals for anticounterfeiting applications. The semiconductor nanocrystals will be synthesized using a hot-injection method that offers precise control over the size; shape and composition of the nanocrystals; ultimately; the optoelectronic properties. Luminescent ink will be prepared using the optimized nanocrystals for anti-counterfeiting applications. Then various security patterns; logos; and QR codes will be printed on different types of substances. An investigation of their stability under harsh environmental conditions will be performed for commercial-scale applications. The work plan of the project can be summarized as follows: (i) Design and synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals. (ii) Structural and optical characterization of semiconductor nanocrystals. (iii) Luminescent ink preparation (iv) Design different security patterns; logos and QR codes on different substrates with security ink and test their stability under different environmental applications.,Gurpreet SinghSelopal,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-17,The required background of the student is in the field of Materials Science; Chemistry; Electronic Engineering; Physics; and Nanomaterials.

32544,Low-Dimensional Carbonaceous Materials to Improve the Long-term Stability of Excitonic Solar Cells,Over the last decade; considerable development has been made to boost the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of excitonic solar cells [i.e.; dye- and quantum dots sensitized solar cells (DSCs &QDSCs)] and are now attracting growing research interest from both the fundamental science and technological point of view. Thanks to recent progress in the design of new dyes and electrolytes that enabled the fabrication of low-cost; large scalable and highly efficient DSCs of PCE up to 14% and QDSCs of up to 16% as an alternative to commercial silicon solar cells. However; apart from the improvement in PCE; device stability over time is significantly important; because long-term stability is equally important in order to shift the device from the laboratory to a real market product. In this work; we will incorporate low-dimensional carbonaceous materials such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT); graphene sheets and graphene nanoribbons (GNR) in n-type wide bandgap semiconductors (TiO2; ZnO) to boost the PCE as well as long-term stability. This approach is most promising; fast and reliable as compared to other approaches reported in the literature. A systematic comparison of the long-term stability of the devices with an optimal concentration of carbonaceous materials in TiO2 and devices without carbonaceous to highlight the beneficial effects of carbonaceous materials to improve the long-term stability in correlation with their appealing charge transport; thermal; optical and mechanical properties.

32545,Nanotheranostics: Developing photoresponsive lipidic nanoparticles,Overall; this research project will develop photoresponsive nanoparticles based on donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) and spirooxazines (SpOxs). However; the internship will focus on a single objective that will complement the work of other interns. There are six sub-projects in this interdisciplinary approach. For each photoresponsive system; the first objective of the project is to synthesize and characterize new amphiphilic donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) or spirooxazines (SpOxs). The second objective is to examine the integration of these amphiphilic DASAs/SpOxs with lipid vesicles. The third objective is to examine their photocontrol of membrane permeability in lipid vesicles. Various model lipid systems and well known lipid formulations will be examined. We hypothesize that triggering these photoswitches will be more effective in increasing membrane permeability of a lipid vesicle than current nanoparticle delivery vehicles with photocontrols. Thus; the rate of permeation will be improved and better controlled. The proposed research project will produce a new generation of lipid-based nanoparticles with improved stability and functionality. These results will lead to the development of photoresponsive lipidic nanoparticles for nanotheranostic applications.,R.

32546,Dynamics of the western Canadian boreal forest,Tree growth and mortality rates have a strong bearing on the structure; biomass; and carbon balance of forests. Potential decreases in growth or increases in mortality from drought and insect pests may threaten the long-term persistence of forest cover near the prairie-forest ecotone in western Canada; leading to the loss of ecosystem services provided by forests in this region. This research project will collect both aerial and ground-based data to better understand how tree demography is related to moisture availability in the interior of western Canada. We will use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) systems to carry out 3D surveys of forest canopies across Saskatchewan's boreal forest; and use the resulting data to derive predictive relationships between water availability; growth; survival; and biomass for several tree species. We will also establish a set of sampling plots; including measurements of tree growth and regeneration. These data will help us to quantify how forest structure is related to tree demography; competition; and local environmental conditions. Results from this project will help in understanding how future climate change may affect forests in Canada's western interior over the coming decades.,MarkVanderwel,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-28,The student should have a background in biology; forestry; environmental science; geography; or a related field.

32547,Priming of cellular response by epigenetic marks in response to dioxin exposure,This project will investigate the phenomenon of priming; where a second exposure to the same stimulus results in a stronger induction of response than the first. Priming inherently requires that cells “remember” the initial exposure; and we believe DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a role in that memory. Our overarching hypothesis is that developmental exposure to stimulus induces stronger priming than later life exposure and that this priming is dependent on DNAm. We will use the induction of genomic Dioxin Response Elements (DREs) by the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in response to dioxins to understand epigenetic regulation of environmentally-responsive genes in mammals. This project will use cell culture and molecular biology to identify genes which undergo priming in response to the dioxin TCDD. We will culture a number of cell lines; including hepatocytes; which have a well-defined and characterized dioxin response and are known to induce AhR pathway members in response to TCDD; MIN6 pancreatic beta cells; which serve as a negative control as they do not undergo a dioxin response or express AhR members14; and embryonic stem cells (ESC) which also have a robust dioxin response but represent an undifferentiated cell type from an earlier developmental time. In all three cases; we will culture cells with TCDD for 48 hours to induce expression of DRE genes; consistent with previous studies. They will collect samples at baseline; 24 hours into exposure; immediately post exposure; and 1; 7; and 14 days later for molecular analyses by pyrosequencing at candidate genes; with the possibility of also using genome wide DNAm; ATAC-seq; RNA-seq; and/pr ChIP-seq. They will also perform a 4 week washout period before re-exposing some cells to TCDD once again; and repeating sample collection and molecular analyses.,MeaghanJones,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-13,Skills needed: Experience in a lab setting; molecular biology experience a plus Attention to detail Meticulous record keeping Ability to work independently and in a team Curiosity and willingness to try Skills gained during the project: Basic data analysis Tissue culture of mammalian cells Molecular biology Next generation sequencing and/or Pyrosequencing Reporting Presentation skills,Genetics; Molecular Biology; Biological Sciences; Biochemistry
32548,Epigenetic effects of prenatal cannabis and tobacco smoke exposure,Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke in humans leaves behind changes in DNA methylation at a number of specific genes; some of which are likely due to tobacco-specific compounds; but some might be due to inhaled particulate matter in general. Since cannabis was legalized in Canada; we need to better understand the health impacts of cannabis smoke and how these overlap with tobacco smoke. However; it is difficult to determine cellular function changes and health outcomes from human population studies. Thus; we are modeling prenatal cannabis smoke exposure in mice; with the goal of being able to assess timing; outcomes; molecular mechanisms; and other details. This project is foundational to that work; designing and optimizing assays to measure DNA methylation at these known genes in mice; and then testing tissues from animals with and without prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke to identify changes.,MeaghanJones,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-13,Skills needed: Experience in a lab setting; molecular biology experience a plus Attention to detail Meticulous record keeping Ability to work independently and in a team Curiosity and willingness to try Skills gained during the project: Basic bioinformatics Molecular biology Next generation sequencing and/or Pyrosequencing Assay design and validation Reporting Presentation skills,Biological Sciences; Biology; Molecular Biology
32550,R package develpement for the nonparametric estimation of multivariate Value at Risk,The multivariate Value-at-Risk (MVaR) is an important measure of risks for portfolio risk analysis when the risks are inter-dependent. As a natural extension of the univariate Value-at-Risk; the MVaR is defined in terms of the conditional expectation of a vector of random variables given that the joint distribution function gets a specified level. This project aims at developing an R package on the non-parametric estimation of multivariate Value-at-Risk using Nadaraya-Watson estimator for the conditional expectations. First of all; we will write an R function that accepts various multivariate models including Archimedean Copulas as inputs with an option to specify a bandwidth selection. The result will be tested and validated with a comprehensive simulation study. Then an R package based on the R function and examples will be constructed.,TaehanBae,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-08,The candidate is expected to have some background in Actuarial risk modelling; Statistical inference; and basic knowledge in R programing.,
32551,Developing parallel machine scheduling policies,Machine scheduling is a common problem in many industrial settings. Production can be interrupted by scheduled maintenance periods; repairs or processing of high-priority jobs. These interruptions may leave some machines unavailable for processing of ordinary jobs. If the processing of an ordinary job happens to be interrupted because of one of these unavailability periods; there may be some rework necessary to complete the job due to machine set-up times or other factors. If there is no penalty when a job is interrupted by a non-availability period; it is said to be resumable. If a penalty is necessary when a job is interrupted; it is said to be semi-resumable. If a job must be restarted completely (maximum penalty) when it is interrupted it is said to be non-resumable. These interruptions; which are quite common in industry; have resulted in economic losses thus attracting research interests on the topic. Our team has investigated the problem of parallel machine scheduling with multiple non-availability periods for non-resumable; semi-resumable and resumable jobs. We have made significant contributions in this area when dealing with the minimization of the product makespan. The goal of this project is to extend the previous mathematical models developed by our research team to include other performance measures.,ClaverDiallo,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-08,Mathematical modelling: Linear programming; stochastic processes; reliability modelling.

32552,Optimization of selective maintenance strategies,Maintenance is a critical function in industrial manufacturing and for service systems. Equipment failures can result in economic losses and cause harm to the environment or humans. In many industrial settings; it is common to have large and complex multi-component systems performing consecutive missions interspersed with finite breaks during which a limited set of component repairs or replacements can be carried out due to limited time; budget; or resources. Due to the limited duration of the scheduled breaks and scarce maintenance resources; only a limited set of components can usually be maintained during the breaks. Since these systems have built-in redundancies; they may still be operable when certain components are not repaired. It is therefore necessary to identify an optimal subset of components to maintain in order to meet the predetermined performance level required for the next mission. This is known as the selective maintenance problem (SMP). Our research team has made significant contributions in the optimization of the SMP for large and complex systems. The goal of this project is to extend the previous mathematical models developed by our research team to include new performance measures and operating features.,ClaverDiallo,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-08,Mathematical modelling: Linear and Nonlinear Programming; Optimization; Reliability modelling.

32553,Remanufacturing Strategies for Second-Hand Systems,Remanufacturing is the process of restoring used products to like-new condition by disassembly; cleaning; repairing and replacing parts; and reassembly. Economically; remanufacturing can be profitable; but this is heavily conditioned by the industry; product type; and on the level of uncertainty in both the number of returned products and in the quality of the returns. The condition and state of degradation of returned products affect the reliability and yield rates of the components recovered by disassembly from these products. Using these parts in the remanufacturing process also requires upgrading and reconditioning that can increase the cost of the remanufactured second-hand products produced. Moreover; remanufacturers tend to offer generous warranty coverage to attract consumers. The environmental and economical implications of all these logistics; production; sales and support decisions are high. Our team is currently investigating the maintenance; reliability and performance optimization issues for these remanufactured; refreshed or second-hand products. The goal of this project is to extend previous mathematical models developed by our research team dealing with the selection of optimal upgrade levels and the determination of the corresponding warranty coverage to be offered on remanufactured second-hand products.,ClaverDiallo,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-08,Mathematical modelling: Linear programming; stochastic processes; reliability modelling.

32555,3D model of prostate cancer by tissue engineering,Prostate cancer affects a large number of humans with significant costs. Despite treatments; including Androgen Deprivation Therapy (chemical castration); several patients see their cancer progress to potentially metastatic resistant forms. These forms will significantly reduce the lifespan of patients. The current models (standard cancer cell line culture or animal models) do not effectively reflect the tumour microenvironment; so we have developed a tissue-engineered 3D human prostate cancer model based on our bladder cancer model. We want to investigate the role of the extracellular matrix's stiffness in the tumour's vicinity in the invasion process; which will ultimately lead to metastases; particularly in connection with the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Human 3D prostate will be reconstructed using the self-assembly method; and their mechanical parameters will be evaluated and modulated by adding cancer-associated fibroblasts and/or chemicals to the tissue. The invasion of such tissues by prostate cancer cells will be monitored by confocal microscopy and correlated to the stiffness. From a perspective; a better knowledge of the regulation of mechanical properties of stroma by cancer cells through cancer-associated fibroblasts should help to develop new treatments. Also; such a model could be used for personalized medicine as a drug screening platform.,StéphaneBolduc,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-06,The student should have basics in cell culture and be interested in biology; bioengineering and tissue engineering.

32557,Exercise intensity,Forty adults with Type 2 diabetes will be recruited to participate in a 16-week exercise program. Participants will be randomized into a moderate-intensity group or a high-intensity group. The exercise intervention will be a mixture of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise. Participants in the moderate-intensity group will train 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (55-60% of maximal capacity) per week and one set of 12-15 repetitions (65-70% maximal strength) for 7-10 exercises targeting major muscle groups. The High-intensity group will train 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (50-55% of maximal capacity) per week and one set of 12-15 repetitions (80-85% maximal strength) for 7-10 exercises targeting major muscle groups. Testing two different intensities for an equivalent dose of exercise will allow us to better targets the intensity of exercise for this population. In addition; a registered nurse will take blood draws from the participants to determine blood glucose and insulin concentrations; HbA1c; hormones of interest; and gut microbiome via feces.

32571,A Machine Learning Approach for Survivable Networks,Machine learning can play a vital role in improving network survivability by predicting network failures and taking proactive measures to prevent them. One approach to this is to use predictive analytics to identify patterns in network traffic and usage and then use these patterns to predict when network elements are likely to fail. This can be accomplished by training machine learning algorithms on historical data and then using this trained model to make real-time predictions. In addition to predicting network failures; machine learning can optimize network performance by automatically adjusting network parameters based on changing traffic and usage patterns. This can help ensure that the network operates at peak efficiency; even during periods of high demand or unexpected network events. Using machine learning for network survivability can help to improve network reliability; reduce downtime; and increase overall network performance. As such; it is an area of active research and development; with many promising approaches currently being explored. Our goal for this project is twofold: 1) Developing an ML-based inspection system can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of inspection processes. Combining data collection and ML algorithms can automate the inspection process and detect anomalies more effectively; and 2) Conducting a performance evaluation of the proposed solution to measure the system's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.,YaserAl Mtawa,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-01,The student should have the following skills: - A good knowledge of machine learning (ML) - Ability to apply ML algorithms using Python or MATLAB - Some knowledge of Computer Networks - Good analytical skills - An excellent technical writing - Ability to work alone and within a team setting,
32572,Cellular underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases.,One fundamental question presented by late-onset genetic diseases like spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is: why do disease symptoms not arise earlier? This is particularly puzzling in a disease like SCA6 where the underlying genetic mutation alters a protein that is known to be important for brain development. Why then does SCA6 not develop during childhood; instead of mid-life? Using a mouse model of SCA6 allows us to gain insight into the mechanisms that occur in the brain before disease onset; in order to understand what changes precede disease presentation. Our preliminary findings show that there are developmental changes occuring in the wiring and ourput of brain circuits in the cerebellum in developing cerebellum. Remarkably; a few weeks later when the cerebellum is mature; yet still before disease onset; circuit function has been restored. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms are recruited during development that allow the recovery of normal circuit function. Our hypothesis is that this compensation is what allows the disease to present in mid-life rather than during development. Our aim is now to identify the compensatory changes occuring at the level of individual neurons and their synaptic partners; by comparing the expression and function of proteins at three time points: during development; in young adult; and at the age of disease onset. By identifying and understanding these compensatory mechanisms; we may gain insight into the cellular processes that underlie the pathophysiology of SCA6.,AlannaWatt,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-06,We are looking for an enthusiastic and motivated student who wants to make a difference this summer! Some general laboratory experience is necessary; but we will train the right applicant in the required techniques.

A student with a long-term goal to pursue graduate studies would be ideal.,Neuroscience; Biology; Biological Sciences
32573,Quantifying phylogenetic uniqueness in the fish tree of life,Species are not evolutionarily independent; and their phenotypic and ecological attributes depend; to some extent; on their phylogenetic relationship. Closely related species tend to exhibit similarities due to niche conservatism mechanisms that limit phenotypic diversification or through neutral models of evolution. Consequently; conserving the greatest amount of evolutionary diversity might also ensure the preservation of a substantial amount of ecosystem services and phenotypic diversity. One approach to protect a significant portion of the tree of life is through the conservation of phylogenetically unique species; i.e. species that share minimal amounts of the tree of life with other species. To determine which species should be prioritized for the protection of the tree of life; one approach is to integrate endangerment/vulnerability metrics with phylogenetic information. Current prioritization lists that incorporate phylogenetic information focus on flagship species or include only a couple of lineages that have almost full-resolved phylogenies (e.g.; sharks and rays; mammals; plants). To overcome these limitations; this research project aims to produce (i) synthesis phylogenies based on taxonomic and phylogenetic information available in the literature; and (ii) quantify species’ phylogenetic uniqueness to set priorities for conservation. To achieve such a goal; we will first take bony fishes as the target lineage. Phylogenies will be imported from the Fish Tree of Life; the most up-to-date molecular phylogeny of bony fishes that comprise about 30% of the total number of species. Then; taxonomic information will be extracted from online databases and literature in order to build a synthesis phylogeny with all bony fish species. The synthesis phylogeny will be used for calculating the phylogenetic uniqueness index for all species and subsidizing conservation efforts to protect the fish tree of life. Finally; this approach will set a baseline for the phylogenetic prioritization of other clades with poor phylogenetic knowledge.,BrunoEleres Soares,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-06-03,The student must have a background in biology; zoology; or bioinformatics in order to better grasp the goals and nuances of the project.

32575,Healthy brain - how do nutrition and microbiota affect the neurodegeneration?,Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are incurable debilitating conditions that result in progressive degeneration and/or death of neurons. Alzheimer’s (AD); Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s (PD) diseases are examples of neurological disorder that are characterized by progressive problems with movement (called ataxias); or mental functioning (called dementias) that significantly impairs the patients’ daily life. The etiology of these disorders has been associated to multiple and distinct genetic factors but we still have not identified all the genetic factors involved in the mechanisms of disease yet. Oxidative stress; alteration in lipid profiles and insurgence of neuronal inflammation are factors that contribute to the development of NDs. Importantly; emerging evidence suggests that changes in diet and microbiota can influence the metabolic and inflammatory status of neurons that is linked to disease insurgence and progression. The cellular factors controlling local and remote metabolic signaling that affect the brain remain unknown. The student will participate to this ongoing research with my graduate students. The student research will rely on metagenomics; genetics and metabolomics screen that will establish: 1) how the dietary- and microbiota-derived metabolites that control brain health; 2) how metabolism of peroxisomes control neuroinflammation.,FrancescaDi Cara,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-03,Genetics and molecular biology background would be an asset for this project. Ideally some experience using Drosophila melanogaster as model organism.,
32576,The role of peroxisomes in inflammatory diseases,Peroxisomes are highly conserved metabolic organelles known for their roles in the lipid metabolism; essential for cell survival. ) In the past 10 years; peroxisomes have also been proven required for immune cell development and function; regulating key immune response pathways during bacterial (e.g. NK-kB) and antiviral responses; and initiating plasmalogen synthesis and inducing ferroptosis in inflammation. To study the link between peroxisomes and inflammatory diseases; we will use unstimulated and LPS-stimulated blood leukocytes from healthy controls and patients affected by autoinflammatory diseases; two asymptomatic Familial Mediterranean Fever patients and four Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndrome patients (two with Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and two with Muckle-Wells syndrome). We will extract leukocytes by dextran sedimentation and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation. We will measure peroxisomal changes in number and shape in monocytes and lymphocytes after activation with LPS and TcdA; respectively; compared to inactivated and to healthy controls. Peroxisomes will be identified and quantified with a canonical peroxisomal marker anti-SKL staining in flow cytometry analyses and by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using anti-SKL and another peroxisomal marker; anti-ABCD3; imaged by confocal microscopy and analyzed by ImageJ. Neutrophils; monocytes; and lymphocytes from the same patients will also be analyzed with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for peroxisomes numbers; identified by DAB staining. If a correlation is found between peroxisomal changes in shape or number and intensity of diseases and secretion of inflammatory mediators (measured by ELISA); we will generate Crispr/Cas9-induced peroxisomal mutant cells to probe whether reducing peroxisomes in monocytes can reduce the inflammatory phenotypes.,FrancescaDi Cara,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-03,Molecular biology and cell culture experience would be a benefit.,Immunology
32577,Measuring CDN-delegation practices over the Internet,Delegation of services and/or operations is a common Internet practice. Examples include the delegation of user authentication (e.g.; Single-Sign-On; SSO); delegation of server authentication (e.g.; using Certificate Authorities; CAs); zone delegation in Domain Name System (DNS); and delegation of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). Our research group is currently analyzing the security of various delegation mechanisms over the Internet. In many of these projects; we run large-scale Internet measurement studies from our lab; where we have an Internet connection designed for this purpose. Such measurement studies must be designed carefully and creatively; as in many cases the method to conduct the measurements is unclear. In this specific project; we will research methods to analyze how CDNs are delegated; and how the properties for such delegation are communicated to the user-agent (web browser). Setting up the delegation between the content owner and the CDN requires various configurations. Delegation methods often dictate the level of control that the content owner can have over the CDN. Previous research explored various methods; including URL-rewriting; domain hosting; and DNS alias pointing. Each such method require the browser to independently verify the identity of the CDN; and its legitimacy to distribute content. The project seeks to analyze the usage extent of techniques like LURK; proxy certificates; delegated credentials; KeylessSSl; among others over the Internet.,AbdelRahmanAbdou,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,Programming skills; data analysis; some basic stats; and networking knowledge.,
32579,X-ray tube focal spot digital mapping and assessment,The x-ray tube focal spot size ranges from 100 microns square to about 2 mm square. Pinhole radiography was established in the early decades of radiologic physics as a standard tool for mapping the source distribution. The standards of a decade ago specified the use of direct x-ray film (i.e. film without scintillation screens) in order to minimize detector blur. Direct x-ray film is time consuming to use; and its images must either be assessed visually using a magnifier; or scanned with a microdensitometer for computer analysis. Furthermore; recording x-ray images on any type of film is now rare in radiology. Modern miniature digital detectors present an opportunity to assess x-ray tube focal spots more conveniently and more quantitatively. Our lab has two pinhole apertures (30 and 75 microns; Fluke Biomedical) for focal spot imaging; and a Hamamatsu S11684-12 intra-oral dental detector with a 1000x1500 array of 20 micron elements. This element size is smaller than needed for recording patient images but it is perfect for recording in detail the x-ray tube focal spot emission pattern. This usage has been evaluated by a previous student who demonstrated that although the focal spot pinhole images are faint; their acquisition is possible using manual mode. Addition of exposures results in a focal spot intensity map. Building on this work; the intern will (i) configure a mounting system to align the detector; pinhole and x-ray tube to make a focal spot inspection camera; (ii) write scripts in Matlab for image summation; projections and other analysis; and (iii) the camera will be tested on two general radiology tubes and two C-arm tubes. The tradeoffs of using the 30 versus 75 micron pinholes will be investigated. Focal spot characteristics will be measured versus tube potential (50 to 120 kV) and current (50 to 300 mA).,PaulJohns,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-06,Appropriate preparation for this project would be courses in modern physics and a senior physics laboratory; plus experience with programming; which optimally will include practical knowledge of Matlab. Programming will be in the Windows environment. In the lab; the intern will be expected to work with ionizing radiation. Although my lab’s interest is medical applications; the emphasis is on technology and prior life sciences courses are not expected. This project can provide an interesting mix of physics analysis; experiment; computation; and instrument mechanical design.,
32580,Image-based soil organic matter characterization for sustainable management,Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered as the backbone of soil health or soil quality and influences many physical; chemical and biological properties and processes. For example; SOM influences soil structure; affects water holding capacity; nutrient contributions; biological activity; water infiltration; air exchange; pesticide activity; soil compressibility; and shear strength. It is a critically important property that determines soil functionality and use. Proper characterization of SOM can help make informed management decisions for agro-environmental operations. The two most common methods of SOM estimation are Walkley Black acid digestion and weight loss on ignition. However; the requirement of specialized equipment's; trained professionals; time for analysis and sample preparation; cost; and labor pose challenges in measuring SOM on a large number of samples in order to characterize and map soils with high spatial variability. Spectroscopic characteristics measured using Vis-NIR or NIR sensors have shown promise in predicting SOM in laboratory ex-situ conditions or at the field in situ conditions. However; the high price and often the portability of these instruments restrict their common use. With the advancement of imaging techniques and the development of computing powers; computer vision-based image analysis techniques show promise to characterize soil properties including SOM as it contributes to the color of the soil. Along with good cameras and other advanced imaging techniques; cell phones became an increasingly popular device for photographs. The availability of cell phones with high processing power and image collection capability could provide us new ways to characterize soil. This project aims to develop a cell phone app to characterize SOM. In developing the app; reliable and robust image analysis algorithms need to be developed. So; the first part of the project is to develop an algorithm that can analyze images of various qualities and then develop an app for cell phones.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in cell phone app development; computer programming; and image processing is required with desirable knowledge on image collection or photography using different types of camera; taking the photographs of soil samples; collecting and processing soil samples in the laboratory and in the field; and setting up laboratory conditions to take images.

32581,Developing computer vision algorithms for characterizing soil properties,Soil properties vary from location to location. Therefore; we need to measure a large number of soil samples In order to characterize soil properly. However; most of the soil properties are time-consuming; laborious; and expensive to measure which calls for new methods to overcome the issues. With the advancement of imaging techniques and the development of computing powers; computer vision-based image analysis techniques show promise to characterize soil properties. Developing reliable and robust image analysis algorithms can provide a large number of opportunities to characterize soil quickly and cheaply. Soil texture (percent sand silt and clay fractions in soil) is an important factor for the decision-making of a large number of agricultural management operations; civil engineering applications; and other industries. Similarly; soil organic matter is considered the backbone of soil health and quality. This project aims to develop a reliable and robust computer vision algorithm to characterize soil texture and organic matter. In general; soil texture and organic matter are affected by the presence of soil moisture. Previously some attempts have been made to characterize soil texture and soil organic matter using computer vision techniques. However; the challenge lies in the effectiveness of those algorithms as the image quality is often affected by soil moisture. A new algorithm to be developed or organized by combining several old algorithms to characterize soil properties. Examining the effect of soil moisture on the image quality and the performance of the newly developed algorithms on those images would provide a new way to characterize soil properties specifically soil texture and soil organic matter.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A background in computer programming and image processing is required with desirable knowledge on image collection or photography using different types of cameras; taking photographs of soil samples; collecting and processing soil samples in the laboratory and in the field; and setting up laboratory conditions to take images. Knowledge of coding (Matlab/R/Python) to automatize the image processing algorithm and image collection system using a computer is required. Critical thinking and comprehending knowledge are also required in this project.,
32582,Revival of Viable But Non-Culturable Pathogens from Food and Environmental Samples,Through research we have identified that pathogens can enter a Viable But Non-Culturable (VBNC) state whereby cells remain viable but cannot be cultured using standard plating techniques. Of significance; pathogens in the VBNC state can remain infectious and hence food safety risks frequently under-estimated. Previously; there have been attempts to enumerate VBNC through using viability staining coupled to molecular based methods. However; due to the cells being in a dormant state such approaches have limited success in differentiating between dormant and non-viable cells. The current project will develop novel approaches to detect or revive dormant cells thereby providing accurate data that can be applied for risk assessment. Once the method for recovering VBNC has been optimized this will be applied to assess the survival of pathogens in the inputs of CEA along with the final plants. The inactivation of VBNC relative to normal cells treated with biological; chemical or physical intervention methods will be assessed. The intervention methods will include protective cultures (probiotics); plasma-activated water; and a process based on gas-phase hydroxyl radical process. Of interest will be to assess if VBNC cells have enhanced resistance to treatments and retain viability. Here; the inputs into CEA will be inoculated with the test pathogen then the intervention measures optimized for microbial reduction without negatively affecting seed germination/plant development. The inactivation kinetics will be modeled then use to devise and provide a prediction of the optimal treatment parameters that will subsequently be verified,Keithwarriner,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-06,The project will suit someone with a background in food science or microbiology. The techniques to be applied will include pathogen handling; enumeration and characterization.

Our goal is to develop a platform technology that can be deployed in a wide variety of health and diagnostics-related applications; including wearables; implantable sensors; low-cost sensors for developing countries; biodefense; and remote environmental monitoring. We have developed the only low-cost; scalable method of fabricating solid-state nanopores - nanometer sized holes in thin insulating membranes like silicon nitride. Nanopores are just large enough to allow biomolecules like DNA and RNA to pass through one at a time; with each translocation generating a unique electrical signal as the molecule temporarily blocks current flow through the pore. We are now focused on refining this nanoscale fabrication technology and integrating it with custom-designed molecular labels; and methods to manipulate biomolecules to accurately detect disease at the earliest possible stages; when there are just a few molecules present in a biological sample.,VincentTabard-Cossa,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,Specific skills and experience (this is a diverse list so we don't expect any students to possess all of these; you will acquire them during this project) • Experimentation: designing; conducting; and analyzing high quality; controlled experiments to understand an issue • Theory: applying theoretical understanding (thermodynamics; electrostatics; mechanics; surface chemistry etc.) to justify the best course of action (whether a design or experimental program) • Design: intuitive understanding of mechanical; electrical; and fluidic systems; and experience with CAD programs (SolidWorks; Inventor; etc.) • Hands-on prototyping experience: 3D printing; hand and power tools; wiring; soldering; hacking; building; gluing; fasteners; etc.,Biological Sciences; Chemistry; Engg-Biomedical; Engg-Biological; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Materials; Engg-Mechanical; Engineering; Molecular Biology; Physics

32588,Is Alzheimer's diseases caused by hidden viruses in our brain?,Several aspects of AD pathophysiology remain unknown. Accumulation of misfolded protein in the cytoplasm; and amyloid plaques outside the neurons as well as inflammation are a few topics that are actively researched. We also know that many genes undergo expressional changes and many vital proteins are abnormally decreased or increased in the brain tissue of AD patients. However; the cause of these changes is still unknown. As he human life expectancy is increased; it is estimated that the number of patients with dementia and the cost of health care will increase significantly for the next two decades. Therefore; it is very important to find new treatments for dementia. In this project we will be looking at the nucleus of the nerve cells; as it contains the chromatin and controls all cellular functions. We and others have shown that the nuclear envelope on neurons shrinks in AD; and this causes changes in chromatin compaction and affects gene expression. Human DNA composed of large portion of non-human DNA including ancient retroviruses that are incorporated in our genome. We ask whether the pathology associated with AD can be caused by expression retroviral proteins that are awaken after nuclear envelope shrinkage. We have identified the molecular players that cause these changes; and plan to see if we can prevent these changes. The student assistants in this project will learn neuronal biology by working in the lab and assessing specific molecular signalling pathways. Student will learn neuronal culture; assessing changes in gene and protein after nuclear damage.

32590,Statistical challenges in individual participant data meta analysis,In a typical meta analysis; estimates of the parameter of interest (e.g. odds ratio) are extracted from the literature or by contacting researchers and pooled together. In contrast; for IPD-MA line-by-line patient data are obtained from each study. IPD-MA data permit researchers to define exposures and outcomes consistently across studies; and to analyze the association of interest consistently (e.g. adjusting for the same confounders); which may minimize heterogeneity. IPD-MA are of particular value for synthesis of observational studies. In traditional MAs based on published data; it is difficult to investigate differences between study results; to adjust for differences in populations across studies and to pool effects that have been adjusted for other variables. IPD-MA have higher power than meta-regression to detect covariate-treatment interactions; and are preferable when the aim is to estimate interactions with patient-level covariates. IPD-MA are not prone to ecological bias; because patient-level data are not aggregated. While in some cases IPD-MA and aggregate data MA may give similar results; this is unlikely when evaluating treatment-covariate interactions; incorporating nonlinear relationships; when trials are small; and there is heterogeneity across trials; and particularly for pooling of non-randomized studies that may need to adjust for several confounders. For these reasons; IPD-MA are considered the gold-standard of MA; despite the complexity and cost of collecting the data; and are published with increasing frequency. The student and the supervisor will work together to determine a suitable project in this domain; considering the skills; abilities and interests of the student.,AndreaBenedetti,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,The ideal candidate is a student completing an undergraduate degree in Mathematics or Statistics.

32591,Examining the role of Secretion Associated Ras-related GTPase-1B (SAR1B) in muscle nutrient sensing and metabolism,Despite SAR1B expression being the highest in skeletal muscle as compared to other tissues; prior studies have only examined the role of SAR1B in the hepatocyte and enterocyte. Whether SAR1B mediate the metabolic effects of BCAA and BCKA in the skeletal muscle is yet to be explored. Hypothesis: Gain of SAR1B function would decrease activation of mTOR; potentiate insulin signaling; and counter metabolic and signaling actions of BCAA and BCKA. Methods: Student will examine whether exposure of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells to higher lipids and/or amino acids alters SAR1B expression and its GTPase activity. Ex vivo and in vitro; C2C12 (mouse myotubes) and H9C2 (rat cardiomyofibroblasts) cell lines will be incubated with high glucose; palmitate; BCAAs and BCKAs for 4; 8; 12 and 16 h; and SAR1B protein and mRNA expression will be measured by immunoblotting analysis and quantitative-PCR (qPCR); respectively. To recapitulate these findings in vivo; SAR1B protein and gene expression will be ascertained in adult mouse cardiomyocytes as well as soleus; gastrocnemius; tibialis and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) of both male and female C57BL6/J mice fed either chow or high-fat high sucrose diets for 4; 8; 12; weeks. Next student will determine if loss or gain of SAR1B function alters insulin signaling in the presence and absence of BCAA; BCKA and high palmitate. Differentiated C2C12 and H9C2 cells will be subjected to siRNA mediated silencing of SAR1B or adenoviral overexpression of SAR1B; followed by exposure to high glucose; palmitate; BCAA and BCKA for 4; 8; 12 and 16h. Cells will then be treated with 100 nM insulin before immunoblotting analysis to examine the expression of genes encoding markers of insulin signaling. Significance: Specifically; this research is expected to uncover the non-canonical role of Sar1B in muscle nutrient-sensing; insulin signaling and its linkages to cellular metabolism; and function.,ThomasPulinilkunnil,New Brunswick,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,Student must possess an undergraduate level background in cellular biochemistry or molecular biology or physiology or pharmacology.

32592,Role of transcription factor EB in cardiac metabolism and function,Rationale: miRNAs are a class of molecules that regulate intracellular gene expression and protein content. Indeed; miRNA-132/212; miRNA 29a; and miRNA30b reduce TFEB gene expression and protein content. During lipotoxicity; whether high palmitate increases the expression of microRNAs targeting TFEB remains to be examined. Hypothesis: Palmitate overload increases the expression of miRNA targeting TFEB to inactivate TFEB in the cardiomyocyte. Objectives: Aim i) To examine if lipid (palmitate) overload activates miRNAs inhibiting myocyte TFEB expression. qPCR expression analysis of miRNA targeting TFEB (miRNA29; miR30; miR132/212) will be performed in BSA or palmitate treated H9C2 rat cardio myofibroblasts; C2C12 mouse myotubes and adult mouse cardiomyocytes. miRNA profiling will also be conducted in cardiomyocytes from C57BL6J mice fed chow and 6 week high fat fed animals. By comparing miRNA profiles between cell lines; primary cells and cardiac tissue; we will characterize the specific miRNA that targets TFEB; setting the stage for subsequent antagomir (miRNA inhibitors) studies. Aim ii) To investigate if antagomir-mediated inhibition of miRNA targeting TFEB prevents TFEB decline during lipotoxicity rescuing metabolic dysfunction and cell injury during obesity and diabetes. H9C2; C2C12 cells and adult cardiomyocytes will be pre/co-treated with TFEB miRNA antagomirs and then subjected to BSA or palmitate overload. Readout for the proposed experiments will include the determination of lipid droplet size and number; TFEB expression; mitochondrial respiration; cell death and organelle (mitochondrial and lysosomal) function assays. Significance: miRNA antagomirs treatment will ensure that TFEB content is not declining during lipotoxicity; thereby attenuating cardiometabolic complications during obesity and diabetes. Since TFEB is indispensable for lysosomal function; characterizing miRNAs targeting TFEB in the cardiomyocyte would lead to a druggable target for obesity and diabetes-related cardiomyopathy.,ThomasPulinilkunnil,New Brunswick,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,Student must possess an undergraduate level background in cellular biochemistry or molecular biology or physiology or pharmacology.

32593,Next-Generation Database Engines,Data-intensive systems (in particular database systems) are a fundamental building block that powers today's digital infrastructure and applications such as machine learning; data mining and blockchains. The making of these systems is heavily shaped by computer hardware; which is going through radical changes and brings both challenges and opportunities. Prior designs; though still work; will not fully reap the benefits of new hardware such as persistent memory (e.g.; Intel Optane DC) that allows data to be persisted without high-overhead storage stack (e.g.; SSDs); manycore processors that feature hundreds of CPU cores; and new networking devices that allow users to run customized logics to achieve line-rate speeds. This research project aims to bridge this gap in software and hardware and devise a next-generating database systems in the context of modern hardware. The project will devise a series of techniques and system components touching upon topics like concurrency and parallelism; transactions; parallel programming and distributed systems.

32596,À la recherche des phéromones des limaces,Slugs are formidable herbivores; but they seem vulnerable with their slow movement and lack of physical defence such as a shell. However; they manage to survive as they can be observed in large numbers in forests and gardens. The key to their success lies in their ability to produce mucus; a viscous liquid made up mainly of water; which serves as a lubricant for movement; a means of defence and an intraspecific recognition system. As a result of work done by my research group; molecules of the terpene family have been discovered in several slug species. At this time; the function of these molecules is unknown. The structure of the identified molecules bears a striking resemblance to onocerin; a molecule found in many plants. This similarity suggests that the slugs acquire onocerin and then transform it into the derivatives they need. This role could also be played by the animal's microbiota. In order to adequately study terpenes from slugs; it is necessary to isolate enough of them to perform a variety of experiments. Since capturing slugs in the forest is laborious; it would be appropriate to keep specimens in captivity and feed them to increase their biomass. However; we must ensure that the desired metabolites will not be diluted during captivity. The objective of this research project is therefore to evaluate the concentration of certain secondary metabolites in slugs during their maintenance in captivity. To do this; slugs will be captured in the forest and then kept in captivity by feeding them easily accessible food. Throughout their captivity; the mass of the specimens will be measured and the concentration of metabolites evaluated by LCMS.,SergeLavoie,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-06,The student must have skills in prototype design; electronics; programming and statistics.

32598,Using machine learning to identify noise aspects in log files,Software systems in production generate data; services; and facilities for their users. But as it runs; it also needs to create other information about the system execution. The log files hold this information; which will be helpful to DevOps engineers; monitoring and observability systems; ensuring the good health of the system; preventing attacks; and even as a basis for investigating any system failures. What are the scenarios; settings; and data capable of generating noise in log files? What data characterize the information desired in the log files; and what information is unwanted? From a knowledge base about logs; one way to reach this objective is to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze the lines of the log files to find the noises of these contained in them. In this project; we will research existing log libraries; interview system operators to understand the scenarios in which logs are used; and what information is desired and unwanted from these scenarios.

32599,Machine Learning techniques for improving the user-base station association in future cellular networks,To tackle the mobility challenges in the next generation of cellular networks (5G and beyond); we aim to propose a centralised mobility-aware user-base station association strategy based on a learning method. As a model system; we propose a hybrid heterogeneous network with the co-existence of sub-6 GHz macro-cell base station; sub-6 GHz small-cell base stations and millimetre wave small-cell base stations. To reduce the need for frequent update of association between a user and a base station; we propose to make the macro-cell base station learn the best association by predicting the future position of mobile users. In other words; after learning and based on the predicted position of mobile users; the macro-cell base station will be able to determine for each user the base station he will be associated with. To perform prediction on the location of mobile users; we propose using a machine learning technique such as deep learning; support vector machine and reinforcement learning techniques. The objective of this internship is to determine the appropriate machine learning technique that minimises the number of user-base station association updates.,WessamAjib,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Wireless Networking and Wireless communications.

32603,Enhancing capacity to combat agri-food misinformation,Online misinformation can hinder the adoption of inclusive and innovative agricultural practices; potentially reinforcing social inequalities. The spread of misinformation in our interconnected world can have profound effects; such as undermining democratic institutions; discrediting scientists; and polarizing society. Studies have shown that agricultural misinformation is produced and disseminated online; which can impede the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. This misinformation can undermine the roles of science; participatory research; and evidence-based decision making; and is often amplified by a network of actors with vested interests. To combat this; our project aims to understand the dynamics of misinformation circulation and develop strategies based on literature reviews; interviews; and surveys with agri-food stakeholders such as farmers and agricultural advisors.

32604,Design and Manufacturing of an Environmental Friendly Pumps for Carbon Capture,Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas; remarkably contributing to global warming and climate change. Nonetheless; CO2 is an inevitable output of a vast variety of industries relying on fossil fuels for addressing the energy demand. On the other hand; CO2 is a valuable matter and can be used in many processes; for instance; CO2 plays a vital role in plant growth (i.e.; photosynthesis) and it is extensively consumed in greenhouses. Therefore; there exists an opportunity to develop and apply a technology that can not only capture CO2 but also directly integrate it into plant growth process in greenhouses. The main objective of this project is to design an airlift pump a CO2 capture device while dissolving it into water if operating by exhaust flue gases from heating processes. Using the new airlift pump technology can improve plant growth by 40-60% while creating a positive environmental impact. During the course of this project; this objective has been accomplished by designing and testing multiple units of these pumps in the field for potential commercialization for the greenhouse industry.

32606,Immune protection in infectious diseases,We will use sterile inflammation; bacteria infection; or virus infection to induce skin diseases. Then; we will study how neutrophil migration is regulated upon Staphylococcus aureus infection. We will study how lymph nodes; particular the fibroblastic reticular cells supporting the lymph node cell migration are altered during the skin diseases. We will further explore airway infection during predisposed diseases.,ShanLiao,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,We will use fixed samples and intravital time-lapse imaging to study neutrophil migration. We will use flow cytometry analysis to characterize different cell populations and other molecular biology tools to study the molecular pathways that can regulate the lymphatic function and neutrophil migration.,
32607,Cancer immunotherapy targeting the tumor draining lymph node (1),The goal of this study is to address how anti-tumor immunity are activated in the tumor draining lymph node (TdLN). We will study how tumor antigen activate anti-tumor immunity during lymphatic metastasis. Next; ionizing radiation (IR) therapy is widely used to treat cancer patients. Recent studies show that the efficacy of radiation therapy depends on activating host CD8+ T cell responses. We will investigate if IR therapy boosts anti-cancer immunity by improving lymphatic function and boost anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses. In our preliminary studies; we found that during cancer lymph node metastasis; tumor antigen and tumor associated DCs enter TdLN and potentially trigger anti-tumor immunity. However; tumor antigen and DCs cannot enter TdLN efficienty in the established lymph node metastases. We will use multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM) to examine how TuDC entering lymph nodes and interact with CD8 T cells. We use B16F10 melanoma cells transfected with ovalbumin (OVA) and fluorescent protein YFP (B16F10-OVA-YFP) to highlight tumor cells and test antigen specific T cell response. We will use anti-CD11c and anti-CD169 to highlight DCs and macrophages repectively. Next; we will transfer CFSE labeled OTI cells (transgenic mouse with CD8 T cells specifically response to OVA) and test OTI cell proliferation and cytokine production. Finally; we will study if IR stimulates tumor antigen and TuDC to traffic to TuLN and activate CD8 T cell responses.,ShanLiao,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a strong background in molecular biology and immunology; and have a strong interest in cancer biology.

32608,Assessing the impact of preimplantation genetic testing on blastocyst and trophoblast development,The project will assess the impact of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) on blastocyst and subsequent trophoblast and placental development. We will measure gene expression by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in genes previously linked to preeclampsia and placental development in mouse blastocysts that have undergone PGT. Gene expression in PGT mouse blastocysts will be compared to mouse blastocysts that have not undergone PGT protocols. We will also assess gene expression in these candidate genes in the media the mouse blastocysts are stored in. If the gene expression signature in the media matches the gene expression signature in the blastocysts; using the media may open a new avenue for non-invasive PGT in the future.,SamanthaWilson,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-01,The ideal student for this project will have a solid background in genetics; genomics; and statistics.,

32613,Soil health and regenerative agriculture,Saskatchewan has a vibrant and growing horticulture industry; home to commercial and market production of cool-season vegetables (i.e.; cole crops; carrots; beets); potatoes; and fruit crops (i.e.; haskaps; saskatoonberries; sour cherries); and a budding greenhouse crop industry as well. Across the province; the horticultural industry is the foundation for many small businesses such as cideries; distilleries; agri-tourism sites; greenhouses; restaurants; etc. With this growing industry; there is a high demand from the prairie horticultural industry for information; resources; and tools to support increased yields; expand production; optimize efficiency for crop production—and especially a high demand for soil health resources and information. Increased knowledge translation and transfer to prairie horticulture growers will help to strengthen this growing industry; help to expand production; and contribute to a more diversified Saskatchewan agricultural landscape and revenue generation.The USask Hort Field Lab infrastructure presents an excellent opportunity for reinvigorating prairie horticulture research and extension; the best equipped on campus horticulture facility located at a Canadian university (2013 TransformUS report). We already have tree fruit orchards of varying ages; berry orchards; annual vegetable and potato production sites; shelterbelts; an all-American flower display garden; and an arboretum with over 900 specimens adapted to circumpolar climate. Further; we have key infrastructure including buildings; agri-photovolatic demonstration; high-tunnels; irrigation equipment; mechanical berry harvesters; etc. With key personnel to organize; coordinate; and lead the activities; we propose opening up the Field Lab directly to horticultural growers and industry by creating a space called the “Prairie Horticulture & Soil Health Interpretive Centre”. This Centre will focus on efforts to translate knowledge gained from prairie horticulture research activities to horticultural growers; and the MITACS student will help with these activities.,KateCongreves,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Required skills include: strong communication; ability to understand and apply research results; ability to translate research findings for public and end-users; strong social skills; professional conduct; solid outreach and extension skills.

32615,How does Chinchillas do their rolling?,Chinchillas are rodents native to the Andes mountains in South America. They are also cute fluffy pets that you can find in local pet stores. They have extremely soft fur and each hair follicle has about 60 very fine hairs (1 or 2 hairs per follicle for humans). One interesting behavior of a chinchilla is that they take bath in fine dust; not in water. To be more specific; they roll in volcano dust. It is said that the dust bath can keep them clean from being too greasy (check out the figure and Youtube videos below) However; do you have the same questions as I do? What’s wrong with being too greasy? Is this true that they clean the oil on fur using dust? If yes; how do they exactly do it? What if the sand is not fine enough; will that work too? Can we model this cute and bizarre behavior; and make something useful for humans?,ZhaoPan,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-01,curiosity; a strong background in physics (intuition; analysis; and experimental),Physics

32618,Towards a conceptualization of crime as occupation,This project is a concept synthesis aimed to explicate crime as occupation and generate a critical account of illegal occupations grounded in extant explanations of crime. The literature has already been searched using index terms including; but not limited to; crime; criminal activity; criminal behaviour; and criminal act/action. We now seek to analyze the results using Hocking’s (2009) occupational parameters for describing the things people do. This project will position occupational science for disciplinary and theoretical integration within the field of criminology; supporting the integration of occupational theories and models with others applied to explanations of crime. This work will also support occupational therapists and occupation scientists who are increasingly working with populations with legal involvement.,MathieuDumont,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,Either English or French,2024-05-13,It is expected that the student will have a background in the field of criminology; social work or psychology.

32619,Réforme de la gouvernance locale pour un Nouveau-Brunswick dynamique et durable : comprendre l’étape de la mise à l’agenda politique / Local Governance Reform for a Vibrant and Sustainable New Brunswick: Understanding the Public Policy Agenda Setting,For several years now; the local governance (LG) model in New Brunswick has led to significant challenges; whether of a social; financial or structural nature. Local governance is defined as the processes; systems and institutions that deliver services to residents and through which they fulfill their obligations; rights and rights; and communicate their needs and interests (International Peace Institute; 2018). Considering the importance of the issues facing the local governance system; some stakeholders; including experts; researchers and community groups; have proposed various potential solutions to address these issues. Despite all these attempts to influence; few changes are made to the current model. However; major changes will be on the horizon in 2020; radically transforming the portrait of local governance in New Brunswick. Why; after so long? In 2018; during its first term in office; the Higgs government put forward its intention to proceed with the modernization of local governance framework. Following his re-election in 2020; coinciding with a second term; this time with a majority; the Higgs government will officially launch its Local Governance Reform. Knowing that the challenges arising from this file have existed for more than 60 years; our main research question is the following: How to explain that the Higgs government finally decided to take seriously in 2020 the grievances of the actors interested in the question of the local governance in New Brunswick; when the many social; financial and structural challenges caused by government inaction in this matter had been known and documented since the 1960s?,ChristinePaulin,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-27,Intellectual maturity; natural curiosity; good attitude (respect; enthusiasm; honesty); analytical skills; skills in research methodology (research in scientific databases; preparation of literature review on specific themes; conducting research interviews; research data analysis; scientific writing); knowledge of both official languages of the province (French and English).,Public Policy and Administration; Canadian Studies; City/Regional Planning; Sociology; Political Science
32620,Ten years after the adoption of their Public Participation Policy: is there “more” democracy in this complex linguistic context? The case of Dieppe / La démocratie délibérative en tant qu’instrument d’action publique : le cas de Dieppe, 10 ans après l’adoption de sa politique P2,Adopted in 2014; the Public participation (P2) policy in Dieppe (New Brunswick; Canada) permitted to increase public participation in this complex linguistic context; where both official languages (French and English) are used. They organized two Participatory Budgeting Process (2015 and 2018) and designed a new digital democracy tool; a dedicated website where citizens can participate at different levels of engagement. But instead of designing and implementing a new policy and P2 tools; where are we now in terms of increasing democracy in Dieppe? Have we met the principles of P2? Do all those efforts change anything in the democracy portrait in Dieppe? Are citizens more involved? Are the staff members and decision makers in Dieppe think and do differently since 2014 regarding democracy (are we doing democracy differently since the introduction of the policy? If so; how (what are the facilitators in doing so)? If not; why (what are the challenges/obstacles?). This qualitative research will be based on other separate projects I’ve done in the past with the city of Dieppe (on the P2 policy; on the digital platform; on both evaluation of the 2015 and 2018 PBP) and on research interviews with key actors at the city.,ChristinePaulin,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-27,Intellectual maturity; natural curiosity; good attitude (respect; enthusiasm; honesty); analytical skills; skills in research methodology (research in scientific databases; preparation of literature review on specific themes; conducting research interviews; research data analysis; scientific writing); knowledge of both official languages of the province (French and English).,
32622,The RET kinase is a key therapeutic target in human cancer,Tumour metastasis is the primary cause of cancer related death; worldwide. Our lab focuses on the regulation of the RET receptor; a cell surface molecule with roles in growth and metastatic spread of several clinically challenging human cancers including pancreatic; lung and breast tumours. While we know that RET is abnormally active in these cancers; we don’t fully understand how it escapes normal regulatory controls to contribute to the spread of these devastating diseases. Our goals are to characterize these regulatory processes and explore RET’s roles and potential as a therapeutic target in multiple human cancers. First; we will determine the localization of RET in the cell under various conditions and how that contributes to tumour invasion. We will use high throughput approaches; such as MaMTH or synthetic lethal screens; to identify RET interactions with regulatory molecules; and investigate their effects on RET functions and signals that allow RET to escape normal controls and contribute to cancer. The student will investigate the protein interactions that regulate RET expression and signaling at the cell surface and how these can promote cell invasion into surrounding tissues. Students will perform molecular analyses of protein expression and interactions in vitro (western blotting); and in vivo (confocal or immunofluorescence microscopy). We will explore effects of perturbing expression of RET and other invasion-associated signaling molecules (over expression or CRISPR knockout) on RET-mediated invasion in functional assays. We will identify processes that target RET to the cell invasive front to promote cell motility and explore RET’s roles in regulating the cell’s degradation of its surroundings which allows tumours to spread and metastasize to distant sites. We will explore therapeutic opportunities to block these processes by identifying novel molecular targets for controlling RET–mediated cell motility and invasion as approaches to limiting RET’s cancer-causing activities.,LoisMulligan,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-13,We are seeking a motivated student interested in developing skills and models for exploration of cancer therapies.

32626,Cognitive Neurorobotics for Damage Recovery,Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) will be employed to construct a decision-making neural circuit model of the human brain; including both connectome and functional perspectives; for sensorimotor activities. The SNN model will include a multisensory brain simulation including visual auditory; somatosensory; motor and interoceptive/ proprioceptive brain modules coordinated by secondary associative modules and further controlled by amodal higher “executive” centers with long-range neural connectivity. As a starting point; we will initially adopt a neurocognitive architecture based on a neural network implementation of the most established neurocognitive modeling architecture: Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R)36. We will materialize this framework; performing research on Neural Engineering Framework in combination with Vector Symbolic Architecture. The interaction of the brain model with a robotic system will be facilitated through the two-way translation of multimodal sensorimotor signals at the robot and stimulating spikes in the SNN to develop a simulation platform for brain-robot interaction. The SNN combines dopamine and Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanisms to learn functionalities from an existing self-model of the robot. This self-model is also plastic as it is updated with experiential learning and is modified by simulation during the sleeping state (dreaming) and during wakefulness (imagination). We will also investigate curiosity-based learning methodologies to study the learning behaviour of the modelled brain-robot system.,RobinChhabra,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-06-03,Artificial Intelligence; Reinforcement Learning; Spiking Neural Networks; Robotics; Signal Processing.,
32627,Muscle synergy feature extraction for applications in exoskeleton design,The project is centered around the extraction of muscle synergies from high-density EMG data. Through wavelet decomposition; we differentiate muscle activation patterns across various frequency bands. Further; we apply matrix factorization techniques like nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF); and independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose the time-frequency representations into distinct components; interpreted as muscle synergies. Understanding the particular synergies that emerge during different physical activities allows us to gain insights into muscle group coordination and their synergistic adjustments to diverse physical demands. These insights will enhance our comprehension of human motor control and its implications for exoskeleton design and control. We anticipate that revealing and understanding these muscle synergies will allow us to design exoskeletons that align more closely with the user's natural movement patterns; leading to improved performance and user comfort.,OrnwipaThamsuwan,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,English,2024-06-03,The intern should have a strong background in biomedical or electrical engineering; particularly in signal processing and programming (MATLAB or Python).

32630,Daily activity monitoring using wearable technologies for outcome evaluation of clinical treatments,Human motion measurement during daily activities (such as walking) is like a fingerprint and can distinguish patients with neurological; psychological; or musculoskeletal conditions from able-bodied individuals. Although human motion can be measured in motion measurement labs; patients may not act as naturally as in their home. Wearable sensor technology is an ideal alternative to for human motion measurement out of laboratories. Although smartphones and watches can assess the step count and the general level of physical activity; they are not validated to be precise biomedical devices (imagine a fingerprint scanner) and cannot be used for medical decision-making. The objective of this project is to develop wearable technologies using off-the-shelf sensors such as inertial sensors and force sensors to precisely assess clinically relevant parameters describing typical activities during daily life. Examples of to-be-measured parameters are the ankle; knee; hip joint angles during walking; standing up or sitting down.

In addition; professional sports; athletic equipment design; protective equipment design; etc. create a major market and potential for R&D activities. Athletic performance evaluation for the purpose of improving the athletic performance as well as injury prevention is usually performed based on the coach’s observation. However; the coach’s observation is frequent subjective and cannot capture slight motion pattern changes. On the other hand; a majority of sportive activities cannot be performed in standard motion capture labs. Wearable technologies create a significant opportunity for sportive performance evaluation in the field and recording the actual and natural performance of the athletes. The objective of this project is to develop wearable technologies for athletic performance assessment in athletic fields such as ice hockey; volleyball; and track and field activities. These technologies will enable the coach and the training team to better assess the performance of the athletes and reduce the risk of injuries.

32635,Prime Ministerial Leadership in Canada,The project is a study of prime ministerial leadership in Canada; focusing on individual agency within an institutional context. I am carrying out a comparative examination of Canadian prime ministers since 1957; asking how and under what circumstances leaders affect political outcomes. The focus is on leadership styles: how prime ministers budget their time; obtain information; make decisions; see that decisions are carried out; and interact with various groups of followers (political staff; bureaucrats; Cabinet ministers; and caucus members). The methodology is qualitative and historical. The research includes a thorough review of the published primary sources and secondary literature; extensive work in the archives for the earlier prime ministers; and interviews with those who worked closely with later ones. The intern's work will focus on archival research My approach is influenced by the prime ministerial predominance model proposed by Richard Heffernan and developed by Mark Bennister. They see the prime minister as the dominant figure in a Westminster democracy; a much more significant player than in the core executive model. A prime minister's influence comes both from the Westminster constitutional structure; which invests much power in the office; and the prime minister's personal resources; including the individual's reputation; personality; and political skill.,StephenAzzi,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,Skills: the student must possess strong organizational and analytical skills; a talent for working independently; and the ability to pay close attention to detail.

32638,Survival and persistence of food pathogens in food products,Food-borne diseases are a major threat for public health and incur significant economic losses. For instance; around 80.3 million cases of salmonellosis worldwide are annually linked to the consumption of contaminated food products. But what makes food pathogens so successful? Their success can be attributed to their remarkable genetic diversity as well as capability to adapt and survive during harsh environmental conditions such as starvation; heat; low moisture; low pH; or even disinfectants. The goal of this study is to expose food pathogens such as Salmonella; Escherichia or Listeria to different stressful conditions and investigate their survival rates as well as molecular adaptations using proteomics; transcriptomics or metabolomic methodologies. Since bacterial cells might undergo structural changes; we will complement our study with microscopic analyses.,NicoleHansmeier,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-06-03,Ideally the student will have a background or interest in microbiology; biotechnology and/or molecular biology.

32641,Development of an isothermal DNA amplification method for the identification of biological species in foods,Food fraud has been estimated to cause $65B USD damage/year to the food industry. The global supply chain shortages elicited by the COVID-19 pandemic have only worsened the issue. Food fraud can also introduce harmful ingredients; such as toxic and/or allergenic compounds to the food value chain; as well as result in long-lasting mistrust of regulatory agencies and the food industry. The rampancy of food fraud can be partially attributed to the lack of effective analytical tools; especially for emerging food products. The current methods to authenticate the biological species in foods adopted by governmental laboratories and the food industry are mainly nucleic acid amplification based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although PCR is well established; these analyses involve costly thermocycler; bulky laboratory instrument (e.g.; centrifuge) and lengthy analytical procedures (e.g.; electrophoresis gel analysis); preventing their use in resources limited areas; such as in a food processing plant or grocery store where the sampling of food products is happening. To provide better tools for authentication of biological species; we propose to develop a simple; rapid; and user-friendly method based on cutting-edge isothermal DNA amplification methods (e.g.; recombinase polymerase amplification; RPA) to amplify nucleic acid of different biological species involved in foods.,YaxiHu,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-06-03,Students from biological science; food science; agriculture; botany and related areas are welcome.

Other general kills that are expected include self-learning skill; teamwork skills and communications skills (both written and verbal in English).,
32642,Development of new quantum machine learning techniques for chemical property predictions,Chemical property predictions using quantum machine learning (QML) represent a highly relevant and interdisciplinary field situated at the intersection of machine learning; quantum computing; and computational chemistry. In QML; novel models in the form of parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) can be developed via the application of quantum circuit learning algorithms. PQCs provide an abstraction layer that conceals the intricacies of gate-level operations on a quantum computer; but they possess limited flexibility in terms of adjustable parameters. Consequently; to enhance the generalizability of QML models and surpass the capabilities of quantum circuit learning; the ability to execute pulse-level operations; which are lower in the quantum computing stack than gate-level operations; becomes essential. We hypothesize that incorporating pulse-level operations into QML models will improve their performance by introducing more adjustable internal parameters and allowing for finer controls to improve robustness against environmental noise on real quantum hardware. The project objective will be to explore the effectiveness of novel QML models in predicting chemical properties (such as reaction barrier heights) through regression tasks. To achieve this; the project aims to develop new algorithms in the realm of hybrid quantum circuit-pulse learning; where various pulse- and gate-level parameters will be learned. The students will work with in-house quantum mechanically calculated chemical data. The nature of the generalization error; in relation to the size of the training data; will be investigated for the developed QML models. Furthermore; the students will evaluate whether the hybrid circuit-pulse learning approach offers any advantage over quantum circuit learning in accurately predicting chemical properties. By exploring these aspects; this project seeks to advance the field of QML for chemical property predictions. It addresses the limitations of standard PQCs and aims to establish the potential benefits of incorporating pulse-level operations into QML models.,Hans-ArnoJacobsen,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Ideal candidates for this project are students seeking to expand their skill sets by combining quantum computing and machine learning while exploring new applications in the process. They should be motivated to work in highly interdisciplinary research settings; collaborating with researchers in the group from diverse natural sciences and engineering backgrounds. Preference will be given to students enrolled in natural sciences with strong computational/programming abilities. While knowledge of chemistry is not necessary; familiarity with it would be advantageous as the application aspect of the project involves regression tasks on chemical property datasets.,
32643,Metabolism of folate and aging in the retina,Homocysteine is an amino acid that; in excess; becomes toxic and requires of folates and other vitamins to be metabolized. Different studies revealed that patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD); a major cause of vision loss; display low levels of folate accompanied by high levels of homocysteine. Unfortunately; we know very little about the function of folates in the retina in the context of AMD. AMD is characterized by inflammation and the protrusion of pathological blood vessels into the central region of the retina (macula). However; it is not clear whether the risk of having these pathological features depends on the efficiency of transporting folate into the cells. With this program; we will explore if with age; specific cells of the retina such as glia or vascular cells lose their ability to bind and transport folates; ultimately leading to the accumulation of homocysteine in the retina and contributing to AMD-linked vascular complications and inflammation.,SergioCrespo-Garcia,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-06,The candidate must be familiar with principles in cell and molecular biology (mRNA; proteins; cell signalling; culture of mammalian cells) and preferably with background in the field of biomedical sciences (understanding of disease; more particularly of ocular pathologies involving the retina). Ideally; the candidate will benefit from having been enrolled at a BSc in Biology; Biomedical Sciences; Biochemistry or Medicine.,
32644,China’s Rise and a New World Order,China’s rise has been the subject of much speculation in the past decades. Today; academics remain divided on the particulars and effects of China’s rise at home and abroad. What will be the effect of China’s rise on its own political system? On the global order? Will China remain a regional power; or will it supplant the US as a global hegemon? Is China actively trying to shape a new world order? If so; what will be its defining features? This project will investigate debates and collect new data on these questions. In doing so; it will pay a particular attention to China’s development and policies abroad; such as the Belt and Road initiative; China’s military build-up and its sovereignty claims in the South China sea; its positioning on the Ukrainian war; etc.,Jean-FrançoisDupré,Québec,Université TÉLUQ,English,2024-05-01,Successful applicants will have the capacity to conduct documentary research in English. Advanced knowledge of spoken and written Mandarin will be a strong advantage. Applicants should also have some knowledge of Chinese politics and political institutions; especially as they relate to foreign policy and international relations. Interest in the topic of China's influences abroad and knowledge of political dynamics between China and at least one other region would be highly desirable. Knowledge of French is not required; but since the internship will take place in Montreal; prospective interns should show an openness to live in a French environment.,
32645,Computational Finance using Machine Learning Techniques,Optional pricing is one of the central activities in computational finance. The well-known Black-Scholes model of pricing the European option leads to a time dependent partial differential equation (PDE). While analytic solutions exist for special cases; numerical computation is necessary to approximate the solution. Beyond the standard Black-Scholes model for European option; many numerical methods have been developed for pricing American and exotic options such as Asian option. Furthermore; new features such as jumps in underlying asset prices and nonconstant volatility have been incorporated in jump-diffusion; Heston's; and regime-switching models. In practice; it is important that one can obtain the solutions fast and accurate. However; the complexity of the solution process depends on the number of underlying assets. When the number of assets are limited to 1 or 2; efficient PDE methods have been developed. In practice; the number of assets is often much higher in the order of tens or even hundreds. Statistical methods such as Monte Carlo have been proposed but still they are inefficient when the asset number is very high. The research project is to explore machine learning technology in order to solve option pricing equations from computational finance in high dimensions. The project will particularly focus on applying the state-of-the-art machine learning models to improve the efficiency of financial computation. Machine learning has been showing success in different applications such as computer vision; but relatively few in computational finance. This project is to investigate the possibility of solving finance equations using machine learning technology that would be more effective than traditional approach.,JustinWan,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-01,Students working in this project are preferred to have the following background: 1. Calculus and linear algebra 2. Numerical computation 3. Programming in python (Background in finance/machine learning is not required; but it would be useful),Computer Science; Mathematics
32646,Design and Development of a Halbach Array for Low Field Portable MRI Applications,With the onset of new machine learning and computer vision; MRI applications with low field (less than 200 milli Tesla) are being revisited. The economic costs to build high field systems continues to rise with the cost and maintenance of superconducting magnets; while low field systems that us neodymium remain cheaper; and have recently been shown for portable applications. This project aims to design a Halbach array for low field applications. Primarily; this project requires the careful placement of many smaller (approximately; 2 cm) neodymium magnets that produce a; strong as possible (50 to 120 milli Tesla); uniform magnetic field over a 30 cm imaging field. The design constraints include: 1) the strength and uniformity of the produced magnetic field and 2) the total weight of the system. The parameters that can modified to achieve the design aims are: 1) number of the neodymium magnets; arranged in a machined lattice. This project would be particularly exciting to students who have an interest in electromagnetic modelling; electrical; mechanical; or biomedical engineering. The student will gain advanced finite element modelling skills. The student will get to perform an advanced optimization relating the position and orientation of the magnets. machine learning strategies should be considered in this process. This can be conducted on our institutions supercomputing resources. The final deliverables will be the design that includes the positions seated in the metal lattice; and the simulated magnetic field; as well as documenting the processes used to achieve these first two deliverables in case additional iterations of the design are required.

32647,Computational Graphics on Virtual Reality Systems,In physically-based simulations; natural phenomena such as water; cloud; fire; and explosion arise frequently. To achieve high level realism; the modern approach in computer graphics is to utilize the underlying physical equations. The governing equations are often complex; nonlinear; with irregular geometry and high dimensions. As a result; solving those equations are time consuming and become the computational bottom neck. The research project is to investigate how the state-of-the-art computer graphics (CG) techniques can be applied to new emerging systems. Most of the existing CG techniques are designed for visualization on a 2D screen. The project will particularly focus on the new visualization platform; namely; virtual reality (VR) systems. VR has been a powerful tool for medical visualization; surgical training; treatment for patients; and game industry. It provides user the 3D visualization of the environment; which can be interacted with the user through an hand held device. However; the VR platform poses two challenges: 1) 3D visualization of the simulation results; and 2) computations in real time. New programming model and computational techniques are required.

32648,Modelling of the Cerebral Vasculature with Arterial Spin Labelling MRI for Age Prediction,Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an advanced form of MRI that is used to measure the capillary level blood flow. ASL works by labelling the blood in the neck; allowing some time for the blood to flow into the brain tissue. A difference image between the labelled and unlabelled images is computed; that is proportional to the cerebral blood flow (CBF). CBF is an exceptionally useful metric in the study of brain health; aging; and diseases. In this project we have data from approximately 250 participants that include anatomical and multi-delay time arterial spin labelling; and we seek to analyze changes in regional blood flow and arrival time across the lifespan. We previously published a paper with only a single delay time ASL; and now seek to extend that analysis (with new data) to a multi-delay time application. To do this analysis; a pipeline that includes several advanced neuroimaging steps is required. Brain extraction of the anatomical and CBF images; registration of these images; and registration to a standard template image with an atlas of brain regions. Partial volume correction and quantification of the ASL images. We conduct these analyses on our institutions supercomputer so that the pipeline can be massively parallelized; and all 250 participants can be run at one time. Once regional measurements have been done; tabular machine-learning and deep-learning models would be built to compare the performance of age prediction. The student will learn many advanced neuroimaging skills when doing this project; including packages such as FSL and FreeSurfer. There is also a chance to implement customized code with matlab; python and/or bash. In addition; the student will learn about tabular machine-learning deep-learning as well. This project is also supported by a graduate student; so there should be sufficient assistance to achieve the objectives.,EthanMacDonald,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,An ideal student should have a demonstrated interest in a technical domain; such as: Biomedical; Electrical; Computer; or Software Engineering; applications from candidates in (Medical) Physics; (Computational) Neuroscience; and Computer Science can also be a good fit for this research program and will be considered.

32649,Brain Emulation using Virtual Brain,This project aims to elucidate the underlying circuitry of the brain to emulate the brain function. Consistent with other projects in our research group; this project will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging data. To determine the underlaying brain circuitry; an advanced MRI method known as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be used to determine the underlaying white matter fiber tracts that connect regions of the grey matter cortex to other regions of the cortex. From this signal we seek to emulate the functional changes observed in blood oxygen dependant (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). The aim with this project is to use an existing emulator; VirtualBrain; to run these simulations and compare the results between the young and old participants; as well as people with brain disease and matched controls. Data for this project has already been collected! However; our research group has no experience with the VirtualBrain emulator; which has only recently been made available in an opensource software utility (https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei). Required data preprocessing will be completed first. The emulator can be run on our institutional supercomputer resource. We hope to find differences between young and old participants; and people with brain diseases (such as Alzheimer’s disease). This project will provide notably useful findings about brain function between young and old; as well as healthy and diseased people. In this project the student will have the opportunity to work with several types of advanced neuroimaging data; for a cutting-edge application; brain emulation. This is transdisciplinary research or described as a ‘computational neuroscience’ project.

32650,Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Brain Circuitry,Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important technology is understanding brain function. fMRI can be used for understanding the connectivity of the brain; revealing regions of the brain that activate together. The networks of the brain have been recently shown to be represented by a graphical model. These graphical models can be seen as a resonant feedback neural networks. This project will involve using MRI data; and in particular; fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging to model brain function. There are a number of steps known to improve this processing; including: motion correction; brain extraction; drift correction. Removal of physiological signal confounds must then be conducting. Remaining signal is considered to be mostly related to neuronal activity. These signals are correlated and thresholded to obtain the connections of the graphical model. If time permits; this analysis can be extended to include the directionality modelling using dynamic causal modelling. The trainee undertaking this project will learn advanced neuroimaging skills and theory about fMRI. They will have the chance to work with high quality fMRI data; on supercomputing infrastructure. The projects will use a several neuroimaging software packages and Python. Adaptive resonance theory is a model suggesting that consciousness and adaptive learning arises from the resonance of brain circuits. Thus; the study of these circuits is important for expanding the understanding of the mind.

The Application development portion of the program is for big data management. Used to manage medical imaging and histology image data. This is particularly interesting application that has been development by several summer students before. There is a chance for the student to make a meaningful contribution to this project also. There are many features we would like to add; and such an internship project allows for a trainee to hone their skills in development for a broad system capable of distributed deployment. Databasing is an important skill for most scientific and industrial domains; and skills learned when working on this project are transferrable to many domains. The Neuroimaging portion of this project is focused on the deployment of pipelines for post processing brain data. Brain data comes in many shapes and sizes and it requires advanced processing such as registration; brain extraction; cortical parcellation and more.

32652,Computed Tomography Perfusion of Stroke using Machine Learning,Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the developed world. This type of stroke occurs when there is a blockage of the blood vessels to the brain; starving them of the nutrients and leading to death of the affected tissues. This can generally not be reversed. Imaging of the total affected tissue of the stroke is important for decision making and treatment. Although there are many methods to image the larger blood vessels; imaging of the flow in the capillary bed is more challenging. One of the most popular methods used for stroke imaging is called; Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP); where the dynamic passage of a tracer is imaged repeated with CTP. This builds a time course of images that can be processed to obtain information about the tissue perfusion (ie – the capillary level blood flow). Our team has already done a great deal of research on this topic; but we believe that machine learning could play an important role in improving the CTP images. This project aims to apply methods such as: advanced signal processing; denoising autoencoder; or the convolutional neural network; to improve the performance of CTP at detecting stroke. Our research group is using advanced supercomputing resources for these applications.

32656,Design and Development of Gradient Coils for Low Field Portable MRI Applications,With the onset of new machine learning and computer vision; MRI applications with low field (less than 200 milli Tesla) are being revisited. The economic costs to build high field systems continues to rise with the cost and maintenance of superconducting magnets; while low field systems that us neodymium remain cheaper; and have recently been shown for portable applications. This project aims to design gradient coils for low field applications. Primarily; the project starts by determining the current densities required to achieve the desired magnetic field gradients. Then the windings can be achieved to approximate those current densities while simultaneously minimizing the inductance. The project can be completed primarily with COMSOL multi-physics linked with python. This project would be particularly exciting to students who have an interest in electromagnetic modelling; electrical; mechanical; or biomedical engineering. The student will gain advanced finite element modelling skills. The student will get to perform an advanced optimization relating the electronmagnetics with the coil.

32658,Controlling Anion Ordering in Quantum Materials,The intern will work on a synthetic chemistry project to target phases with exotic optoelectronic and magnetic properties. Specifically; we are targeting materials which are non-centrosymmetric (NCS) or which do not have a center of inversion within their crystal structure. The lack of an inversion center creates a topologically non-trivial band structure; which is of interest to the field of quantum materials. In addition; certain classes of NCS materials interact with dark matter according to theory. More concretely; these materials display second harmonic generation which is essential in lasers; and have piezoelectric properties making them ideal pressure sensors. The wide range of symmetry related properties makes these materials an attractive synthetic target. Traditionally; synthesis of NCS materials has relied on chance to create the phases with the desired symmetry. While 18 of the 32 crystallographic point groups do not contain an inversion center; this does not translate to 56% of discovered phases being NCS. To increase chances; researchers frequently introduce polar ‘building blocks’ such as octahedra distorted by Jahn-Teller distortions or by the presence of heteroanions. While this approach is sometimes successful; more commonly materials crystallize with anti-aligned dipoles; related by a center of inversion. In the absence of an external field; there is an energetic benefit for the dipoles to align; favoring the formation of centrosymmetric phases. We hypothesize that by adding an external field during synthesis; we will be able to target NCS phases. We will be investigating the phase space generated both in the presence and absence of an applied electric field; adding an additional axis to the phase diagram. In this work the student will learn about solid state synthesis; basic principles of electrochemistry; and structural characterization.,AllisonWustrow,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Students should feel comfortable working in a laboratory setting.

32659,Development of graphene end-of-life sensors for heat & flame protective clothing,High performance fibers have been developed over the last fifty years for the manufacture of fire protective clothing. These fibres display high mechanical performance and are resistant to chemicals; fire; and high temperatures. However; the various conditions the materials are exposed to during their lifetime; e.g. heat; UV; and moisture; reduce their performance over time. In addition; destructive testing has shown considerable loss in performance before any sign of deterioration is visible to the naked eye. Currently; no non-destructive technique is available to assess the residual performance of the materials in service. Thus; workers at risk of heat and flame exposure have no way of knowing if their clothing is still able to protect them from the hazards associated with their tasks. In that context; graphene is opening a new range of possibilities for the manufacture of end-of-life sensors for fabrics. The avenue selected for this project relies on producing graphene conductive tracks on fabric substrate. Exposure to the aging agents causing the fire protective fabric to enter an unsafe range will cause the conductive track to degrade. The status of the end-of-life sensor will be assessed by measuring the electrical conductivity of the sensor tracks. The project is thus aimed at providing solutions to allow wearers of fire protective clothing to assess the condition of their clothing during use. It involves the preparation of graphene-coated fabric samples will then be exposed to aging conditions (intensity and duration of exposure to heat; UV; etc.) known to bring the high performance materials to different levels of loss in performance. The condition of the sensor will be assessed by measuring the electrical conductivity of the graphene track.,PatriciaDolez,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-15,In addition to solid skills in polymer science and materials engineering; it is critical that the student is curious and rigorous.

32662,Development of testing & quality control methods for Joule heating textiles,Joule heating textiles are based on the use of electrically conductive; yet resistive materials to generate thermal energy. This electrothermal actuation technology is used in the medical; protection and sportswear sector with several wearable textile products already on the market. However; no test standards are available to assess the quality of Joule heating textile products yet while several issues have been reported in terms of efficiency; durability and safety. This project is aimed at developing a set of universal test standards to assess the efficiency; durability and safety of Joule heating textiles. To ensure the universality of the methods to be developed; we are using different textile structures encountered in commercial products: woven; nonwoven; knitted; coated; inserted and embroidered heating fabrics. Five conditions corresponding to service conditions identified as most relevant to typical use of heating textiles in clothing applications have been selected for the durability assessment: abrasion; washing; exposure to perspiration; and repetitive stretching and bending. The effect of the damaging conditions will be assessed by comparing the heating performance of the aged specimens with their initial heating efficiency. Signs of damage on the textiles such as loss of the conductive material or disruption of the textile structure will also be recorded. Regarding safety; the test methods will characterize the propensity of the heating textile products to short circuits; ignition; and overheating among others. Once developed; these test methods will be proposed for adoption as standards to international standardization organizations. The standards developed will help the industry improve the durability of the Joule heating textiles for the benefit of users; and support the growth of the e-textiles market.,PatriciaDolez,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-15,In addition to solid skills in science and engineering; it is critical that the student is curious and rigorous.

32664,Radiation chemistry for energy and health applications,Nuclear energy is an important source of energy that helps to significantly reduce green house gases and therefore global warming. It is an important source of energy that we can use to decrease the dependency on fossil fuels as sources of energy. However; their safe and economic applications require a very good understanding of radiation chemistry at the microscopic level. This is in particular very important for coolant as the medium that is used to transfer the fission energy to fluids that turn the turbine as well as for solid state material used in nuclear industry where they may have interface to fluids. It is now known within the nuclear industry that understanding the effects of metal ions and their interaction with coolant radiation products is important when controlling the chemistry in reactor coolants. For example; iron (Fe) transport and speciation in the heat transport system is key to controlling the transport of activated products and irradiation will change the speciation and properties of Fe-based material in reactors. Another very important types of materials that their interaction with radiation affects both nuclear energy and radiation therapy are nanomaterials. In this project; we will focus on such studies.

32667,D'où viennent les terpènes des limaces?,Slugs are formidable herbivores; but they seem vulnerable with their slow movement and lack of physical defence such as a shell. However; they manage to survive as they can be observed in large numbers in forests and gardens. The key to their success lies in their ability to produce mucus; a viscous liquid made up mainly of water; which serves as a lubricant for movement; a means of defence and an intraspecific recognition system. As a result of work done by my research group; molecules of the terpene family have been discovered in several slug species. For the moment; the function of these molecules is unknown. To help us in our investigations; we need a powerful tool to perform laboratory experiments with slugs or small insects. The objective of this research project is therefore to build a maze for in vivo experiments that will be fully automated and easily dismountable for cleaning. A concept of a central enclosure; connected by orthogonal tunnels; will be developed. It should also be dismountable and constructed from inert material in order to be able to clean the surfaces with organic solvents. Motion detectors will be placed at each end of the tunnels to track the movement of the subjects. The signals will be processed by a postcard-type computer using an algorithm capable of deconstructing the movements in the tunnels and storing the information in the form of a matrix (x; y; t). To validate the device; a pheromonal activity test will be performed with slugs that will have to follow a trail of chemical compounds traced on the ground before the arrival of a subject. Statistical analyses will be performed to evaluate different performance criteria.,SergeLavoie,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-06,The student must have skills in prototype design; electronics; programming and statistics.

32668,Molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction - role of lysophospholipase signaling_Clone,Metabolic disorders; particularly insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes; are believed to be primary causative factors for obesity-induced heart disease; which accounts for 11%-14% of heart failure cases. Insulin resistance and diabetes can precipitate “metabolic cardiomyopathy”; which is characterized by changes in metabolism; structure and function of the myocardium that are not directly attributable to confounding factors including coronary artery disease and hypertension. Understanding the pathogenesis of this form of cardiomyopathy is important considering the current obesity and diabetes epidemic; which is expected to lead to a sharp increase in the prevalence of metabolic cardiomyopathy in the near future. Currently; no adequate therapies are available for obesity-related metabolic cardiomyopathy. The overall goal of this research is to identify signalling pathways in cardiomyocytes that not only play a critical role in the development of metabolic cardiomyopathy; but also exhibit great potential for therapeutic targeting. The lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signalling pathway has been implicated by our group and others in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. LPA is a bioactive lipid which stimulates cell signalling through G protein-coupled receptors. Several LPA receptor modulators have been developed that are in clinical trials or have been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; systemic sclerosis; and multiple sclerosis; demonstrating that LPA signalling modulators have promising therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory diseases. Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) are integral membrane proteins that dephosphorylate intra -and extracellular lipids including LPA. Decreases in LPP3 function and the subsequent surge in LPA levels in the vasculature are a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. More recently; LPP3 has also been implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism. Adipose-specific LPP3 inactivation improved glucose homeostasis in mice fed a cholesterol-rich diet. Moreover; heart-specific LPP3 deletion perturbed mitochondrial ultrastructure and decreased respiration and ATP production in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes.,PetraKienesberger,New Brunswick,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,The student would need to have some experience in working in a research laboratory.

32672,Design principles of molecular machines,The science of thermodynamics was initially developed in the 19th century largely to understand the operation of steam engines and to design new engines that were more efficient in making use of energy to do work. In the last 25 years scientists have developed the field of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics; this theory now permits the exploration of microscopic engines; which evolved to perform energetically costly cellular functions in essentially every living organism. This research project will explore the design principles of these molecular machines: what properties make for a well-designed microscopic machine or collection of machines that efficiently converts between chemical and mechanical energy? Specifically; we will examine models of: FoF1 ATP synthase; the strikingly efficient protein complex that uses electrical energy to make ATP; the high-energy small molecule that is the microscopic equivalent of fuel for living things; kinesin and dynein; the widespread transport motors that carry cargos ranging from nanometer-size vesicles to micron-size organelles; and actomyosin; the collection of myosin motors pulling on actin filaments to contract muscles. This research project will use stochastic simulations of simplified models of individual molecular motors; their interacting components; or their assembly into collective systems; to gain insights into how molecular motors are architecturally constructed; dynamically evolve; and work together to achieve such impressive performance. This work will further our basic understanding of what molecular machines have evolved to do.

32673,Block Copolymer Nanopatterning via Mixed Brush Nanoparticles,The goal of this project is to produce films consisting of ordered arrays of inorganic nanoparticles embedded in polymer matrices. While directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) offers the possibility of sub-10 nm patterning to satisfy the goals of the semiconductor industry to miniaturize electronic components; this approach may be limited in general due to difficulties associated with synthesizing BCPs with precise block lengths on an industrial scale. As an alternative; we have shown that nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with mixed homopolymer ligands (polystyrene/poly(ethylene oxide; PS/PEO) self-assemble in solution into micelles; lamellae and vesicles; similar to their BCP counterparts with the same polymer volume fractions. (Macromolecules 2018 51; 9951). Previous work in polymer self-assembly of nanoparticles mostly focused on coating NPs with custom synthesized BCP ligands or using BCPs to template NP assemblies. In our approach; NPs with dense mixed polymer shells that span the complete composition range; are efficiently produced in large quantities through a simple ligand exchange protocol; eliminating both the need to synthesize a library of block copolymers with different block lengths as well as additional steps to incorporate inorganic components. The use of homopolymer ligands and our highly reproducible ligand exchange method allows precise control of molecular weights and polymer volume fractions. We have also produced poly(2-vinylpyridine) P2VP-PEO and P2VP-PS mixed brush metal oxide NPs and nanorods that self-assemble in response to pH; quaternization and selective solvents. The PS-PMMA combination widely used in industry will also be explored along with biodegradable biopolymers in the interest of sustainability. The mixed brush NP synthetic protocol is easily adapted to NPs of different sizes; shapes and compositions; allowing the incorporation of a wide range of functionalities.,LindaReven,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-01,The student should have basic laboratory skills as normally acquired from undergraduate organic; analytical and physical chemistry laboratory courses.

32674,Functionalization of graphene electrodes for supercapacitor applications,Graphene consists of a two-dimensional arrangement of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice and has gained significant attention in the field of energy storage due to its high specific surface area (SSA) of 2630 m2/g. This high SSA makes graphene an excellent choice for electrochemical devices like supercapacitors which can be used for applications such as back-up and regenerative energy systems. Unlike a battery; a supercapacitor stores energy via electrical double layer formation (ion adsorption) on the surface of the electrode material. The aim of this project is to make electrodes through a self-assembly process of graphene oxide (GO); a precursor to graphene. The oxygen groups on the surface of the graphene make the GO hydrophilic; which allows to disperse it in water with high concentrations. The oxygen groups can be removed with simple heat (hydrothermal) treatment of the GO dispersion resulting in the agglomeration of the reduced GO (rGO) in form of so called graphene hydrogels; which can be directly used as supercapacitor electrodes. The additional introduction of selected chemical precursors (such as phosphoric acid; urea or sodium sulfide) to the hydrothermal reduction of the GO changes the self-assembly process which can result in higher SSA and higher electronic conductivity. Moreover; it functionalizes the graphene by introducing new active surface groups that van be useful for electrochemical reactions. In the frame of this project; we test different recipes for making functionalized graphene hydrogels. These hydrogels will be characterized in terms of their SSA; conductivity; and hydrophobicity. Promising materials will be used in a supercapacitor and their performance will be tested.,Dominik PJBarz,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-06,The work is suitable for undergraduate students with a background in chemical; materials or mechanical engineering or in chemistry or physics with an interest in applied science.

32675,Studying Deep Learning Methods for Software Security Vulnerability Detection,Software plays an important role in the implementation and operation of critical infrastructure; industrial automation; network management and emerging IoT systems. The growing demand for system interconnectivity; interoperability and scalability makes software development more complex & prone to security vulnerabilities (e.g. ransomware; malwares; system exploits; etc.). Recent research has reported; that more than 90% of the cyber security attacks occur due to application vulnerabilities and lack of security controls. The safe execution of a system depends on secure and reliable software. Recently; industry and academic researchers have shown keen interest in studying applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop tools and techniques that can detect application vulnerabilities; run dynamic program analysis; automate test case generation; perform error mining and develop predictive security controls. The aim of this project is to develop new techniques to detect software security vulnerabilities by applying deep learning methods.

32676,The effects of ischemic preconditioning on exercise capacity during high-intensity interval training,High-intensity interval training (HIIT); repeated bouts of high-intensity exercises interspersed by recovery periods; is a time-efficient training modality to improve exercise capacity. However; in order to increase training adaptations; there is a scope to identify new strategies that could increase this training stimulus. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC); a non-invasive technique who acutely increase performance; seems promising to achieve this goal. Thus; the specific aim of this project is to caracterize the effects of IPC on physiological responses and exercise capacity during different HIIT sessions (2 types) in males and females. To do so; participants will complete 6 visits. The first visit included a maximal incremental cycling test. The second visit will familiarize the participants to the training procedures. Finally; visits 3 to 8 allowed the participants to execute each HIIT session twice (preceded by IPC or placebo). During these training; we continuously monitored heart rate; power output; O2 consumption and muscle oxygenation changes (O2 uptake and local blood volume) to examine physiological response to each training and IPC-induced changes.,PénélopeParadis-Deschênes,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Autonomy at work Comprehension of written and spoken English Basic knowledge in physiology Computer programming an asset,Health Studies; Physiology; Educ-Phys Ed
32677,Clustering with Mixtures of Functional Linear Regression Models,Functional data are used to represent curves; surfaces; or multidimensional functions; and sample elements are formed by random functions. For example; for analyzing traffic data and finding trends in traffic flow related to speed differences and weather conditions we work with four-dimensional random functions measured through a road section over a certain time interval; and representing the number of cars having a speed 5-10 km/h under the speed limit; the number of cars having a speed 0-5 km/h over the speed limit; the visibility; and the temperature. The main goal of the project is to construct a family of cluster-weighted models for clustering functional data. Cluster weighted models extend the finite mixture of regression models to include modelling of the covariates. We consider functional regression models for which both the response and the covariates are multidimensional functions. For the traffic data the response is represented by the values of the four-dimensional functions measured during the rush-hour interval in the afternoon; and the covariates represents the measurements made from early morning to the beginning of the afternoon rush-hour. The models in this project are based on a family of skewed distributions; and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is constructed for parameter estimation.,CristinaAnton,Alberta,MacEwan University,English,2024-05-01,Good programming skills in at least one of the following languages: R; Python; Matlab; or C.

32678,The Art of Persuasion: America’s Management of Reluctant Allies in an Era of Great Power Competition,Experts ponder whether the United States can sustain its global leadership in the face of assertive and aggressive aspirations from China and Russia. In recent years; many have observed that formal US allies have pursued diverse strategic paths to enhance their security amid intense competition among great powers in places like Ukraine; Syria and the South China Sea. Some allies; such as France and Germany; have emphasized their strategic autonomy; called for the establishment of a European army; and questioned the dominant role of NATO in European defense. Other allies; like the Philippines and Turkey; have even distanced themselves from Washington and threatened to sever their ties with their security patron. How is America addressing the increasing number of reluctant allies on the global stage? This poses a significant challenge for the United States; which has diligently built a robust network of alliances over the past 75 years. This research project aims to explore whether the United States has developed a strategy to maintain its alliances and; specifically; whether it has a coherent approach to dealing with allies who exhibit unexpected and problematic behaviors—reluctant allies who resist aligning with Washington’s leadership (loose cannons; troublemakers). Does the United States rely on coercion; persuasion; bribery; or shaming? And are these strategies effective? The relationships between Washington and five key reluctant allies will be analyzed: France; Germany; Hungary; Turkey; and the Philippines.,JonathanPaquin,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,L'étudiant.e. doit maitriser l'anglais et le français et doit connaître le champ d'études des relations internationales.

32679,Quantum-Enhanced Mobile Communications Beyond 5G,To meet high expectations; and overcome many challenges; mobile communications require novel disruptive technologies. The upcoming 6G networks; in particular; move away from microwaves (1-100GHz; 3-5G networks) to higher-frequency sub-mm waves (~0.1-1Terahertz; wavelengths 3-0.3mm); enabling a 10-100 fold increase in data rates (~10-100Gbps). Moreover; as wavelength shrinks; communication devices become more compact and capable of emitting highly directional beams advantageous for secure communications. Importantly; the Terahertz range is unique as sub-mm waves can be generated both electronically and optically; presenting novel opportunities for classical and quantum photonics-assisted communications. This projects aims at pursuing several disruptive technologies for Terahertz communications using recent breakthroughs in quantum optics; optical computing; optical signal processing; and manufacturing. Optical data processing is faster and more energy-efficient than electronic processing. A focusing lens performs an Optical spatial Fourier Transform (OFT) of a monochrome image at light speed. Also; photonics can accelerate electronic signal processing by taking over vector-matrix multiplications. Optical co-processors were recently demonstrated in the infrared using interferometer meshes with tunable phase elements. Our first objective is to develop optical co-processors in the THz that can apply arbitrary unitary transformations to a vector of input modes. We will focus on devices for energy-efficient temporal signal transformations for wireless signal transmission; acceleration of data processing for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output systems; and implementation of quantum protocols (e.g. complex Hadamards) for quantum THz communications. Our second goal is to study quantum THz communications with the goal of finding novel quantum system designs. First; we will study the SPDC-based sources of THz/infrared entangled photons. Then; we will use such sources to explore a variety of quantum modalities for secure communications; nonlocal beamforming of THz light; quantum ghost surveyance of the communication environment; etc. Finally; additive manufacturing of 3D integrated THz optical circuits will be explored using advanced functional materials.,MaksimSkorobogatiy,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Students should be interested in experimental research in engineering or physics.

Typically; 2D perovskites are deposited using spin-coating; which is a method that is difficult to scale. In the state-of-the-art Koleilat lab; solution-shearing is used; which is compatible with high-throughput industrial-scale processes. This project deals with building stable highly efficient 2D perovskite solar cells. Materials engineering and systematic design of the structure and its various interfaces are also required in this project. These unique solar cells will have the potential to set records for performance and stability of perovskite solar cells.,GhadaKoleilat,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to be interested in science and engineering; passionate about research.

32684,Stretchable solar cells,With the freedom of simply using different types of fabric; employing diverse patterns; and connecting the fibers using various techniques such as weaving or felting; there exist considerable potential for pioneering electronic designs. In general; solution based materials can be spun into fibers and yarns themselves and they are highly elastic in all directions. Until now there is no solution to fabricating air-stable; large-surface; solution-coated power textiles. This project focuses on the top transparent conductive electrode properties and available solution-processed particles that can easily infiltrate fabrics; such as graphene nanosheets; conductive polymers or purely metallic carbon nanotubes. The student will investigate the adhesion of the materials to the fibers and their longterm stability. Secondly; they will explore structural issues that will arise from having multiple layers integrated into the fabrics: our group will develop processes that will shield the active layer from electrode diffusion through the fabric but simultaneously guarantee solid contact between all the interfaces of the various fabric layers. Ideally; every layer should remain undisturbed with each additional coat application. With the textile-based substrate being coarse; the processing of all layers will take into account the solubility; temperature stability; adhesion and chemical reactivity of all the underlying materials. Finally we will evaluate the performance of the solar cell created.,GhadaKoleilat,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to be interested in science and engineering; passionate about research.

32686,Bioinformatic tools for plasmid analysis,Plasmids are small circular pieces of DNA found in bacterial cells that are important due to their role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); a major public health concern. Therefore; the problem of discovering plasmids in sequencing data from bacterial pathogens is a very active research area. The problem of discovering plasmids can be addressed through combinatorial optimization approaches that analyze a graph known as the assembly graph; that is generated when sequencing data is assembled; vertices of this graph are called contigs and represent assembled sequences; and edges encode potential contiguity of the contigs along the genome of origin. Over the last two years; in collaboration with Professor Cedric Chauve; we developed several methods for the discovery of plasmids: 1- plASgraph: is a machine-learning tool that classifies contigs as originating from plasmid or chromosomes. 2- Plasbin-flow: is a mixed integer linear programming model that groups contigs into bins; representing groups of contigs likely originating from the same plasmid. It is a hybrid approach that combines optimization with a reference data used to set the parameters of the model. 3- PlasEval: is a set of tools to evaluate the accuracy of plasmid discovery methods. Accuracy evaluation assumes that a ground truth dataset is provided. Considering the fact that these methods are related and the output of one method can be the input of the other method; it is not ideal for users to study plasmids with different methods in different environments. In this project; in collaboration with Professor Cedric Chauve; we are planning to integrate all these methods into a unique pipeline. We aim to start to create a pipeline of the tools plASgraph; Plasbin-flow; and PlasEval with the possibility of extending the unique pipeline to also use other classification; binning and evaluation methods.,MahsaFaizrahnemoon,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,The student need to have experience in: 1- Programming in Python 2- github 3- snakemake (useful but not necessary),
32688,Quels sont les impacts des bryophytes sur le recrutement des plantes vasculaires natives et envahissantes post-perturbation ?,Forest floor mosses are well positioned to play key roles in plant-soil feedbacks and their importance in ecosystem functioning; including vascular plant recruitment; is increasingly recognized in northern boreal forests. Whether these contributions remain important at the southern edge of the boreal forest; where forest composition becomes mixed with deciduous species; is not yet known. New Brunswick; Canada; lies in this transition zone and has an active forest industry. Disturbances caused by logging operations that expose mineral soils; including alteration of the moss cover; can create opportunities for the establishment of exotic species. Bryophytes can have facilitating; inhibiting or neutral effects on plant germination. On a recently logged site; cores (15cm diameter) of exposed mineral soil; pioneer mosses; acrocarpous mosses and feather mosses will be collected (5 replicates/species/substrate). The percentage cover of the different substrates and the presence of exotic species will be noted. Then; in growth chamber experiments; we will compare the germination of four exotic species found after forest harvesting in New Brunswick (Plantago major; Ranunculus acris; Taraxacum officinale; Veronica officinalis) and of a very invasive shrub in the region (Frangula alnus) on the different substrates. Large-seeded species are expected to tolerate a greater variety of conditions than species with smaller seeds. Mosses are expected to inhibit germination compared to mineral soil. This project will better assess how disturbances to forest soils and moss communities during harvest may alter the likelihood of natural recruitment of native and exotic plants.,MélanieJean,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Although most of the knowledge is acquired through the internship; a basic knowledge and interest in biology; ecology and botany is preferred (studies in biology; botany or environment).

32692,Reaction--diffusion systems with anomalous diffusion,As the experimental measurement techniques advanced; it became clear that the regular diffusion model failed to describe faithfully many diffusive processes; most often in biology and geology. Novel diffusion mechanisms; known as anomalous; currently are at the height of researchers' interest. The goal is to simulate an especially slow or fast type of diffusion that is often encountered in biological tissues and tracer diffusion through geological layers. This project is suitable for an inquisitive; critical and completeness seeking mind. The work combines abstract thinking and numerical implementation. This is a good training opportunity for students; who envision themselves working in inter-disciplinary research and development. The intern will gain valuable skills in working in the Unix environment; parallel computing and visualisation of multi-scale solutions. Adequate progress in this project might serve as a step toward continued research and a Master's or PhD degree.

32693,Application of Machine Learning tools for development and characterization of nanoparticles to improve agricultural sustainability,Application of nanoparticles (NPs) is governed by their shape; size; dispersity; and surface chemistry. Hence to apply them for agricultural sustainability as nutrient carriers; for plant disease suppression or for pest management (nanopesticides/nanoinsecticides); it is important to synthesise them with precisely controlled characteristics and functional properties. Synthesis of NPs using bottom-up or top-down approach is resource-intensive and time-consuming and often requires multiple iterations (trial and error) of various combinations of reagents and experimental conditions such as reaction time; temperature; and reagent concentration; making the identification of the most efficient NPs synthesis recipe a challenge. To overcome this challenge a more efficient and controlled approach is required. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising platform that can be potentially used for the synthesis of NPs with specific or unique characteristics (size; shape and functionality). In recent years ML algorithms have been effectively employed to predict the antimicrobial property or toxicity profiles of NPs but limited to no study has been reported on prediction of synthesis recipes for NPs with specific or unique characteristics for application as nutrient carriers or for pest management. This study will apply ML tools to predict the synthesis recipe (experimental conditions and reagent combinations) for NPs from gathered in-vitro experimental data from literature studies. The literature data will be structured into comprehensive datasets; to train and test ML models. Supervised ML algorithms will be applied to accurately predict the NPs recipe.,AshutoshSingh,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,The student applicant should have a background in engineering; or computer science.

32701,The Evolving Arctic Security and Governance Environment,The Evolving Arctic Security and Governance Environment project examines how the Circumpolar North is changing in the face of climate change; resurgent geopolitical competition; and technological change. This project is connected to research programme of the North American and Arctic Defence and Security Network (NAADSN – www.naadsn.ca) based at Trent University and comprised of leading experts from across Canada; the United States; and Europe. Canada’s defence policy describes the Arctic as an “important international crossroads where issues of climate change; international trade; and global security meet;” and commits to “work cooperatively with Arctic partners.” Our project seeks to: clarify how Canada and its partners can implement this policy direction; generate and provide immediate access to leading-edge research; and test assumptions about the changing Arctic security environment on international; regional; and national scales. Pursuant to this theme; we analyze the security implications of climate change and technology; international strategic drivers (such as evolving North American; Russian; European; and Asian Arctic interests); and global competition to frame the Arctic in ways beneficial to different stakeholders and rightsholders. We also adopt a broad definition of security that includes topics such as search and rescue; emergency management and disaster response; and Arctic Indigenous Peoples’ perspectives on safety and security. Our work on governance in the Arctic examines the role of the Arctic Council and other circumpolar bodies; many of which have been affected by the War in Ukraine. It also examines how international legal frameworks apply to the Arctic; including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP); and how different Arctic rightsholders and stakeholders might interpret and seek to apply international law differently.,Paul WhitneyLackenbauer,Ontario,Trent University,English,2024-05-15,The student must own a laptop computer; be familiar with Microsoft Office; and have experience conducting internet-based research.

32703,Development of an Open-Sourced Software Package for Structural Health Monitoring,Structural health monitoring (SHM) is the process of continuously observing and analyzing a system utilizing sampled response measurements to identify damage in engineering structures like bridges and buildings. SHM is a very important research field that improves the sustainability and safety of current infrastructure systems. The successful implementation of SHM systems can significantly reduce the costs of maintenance by identifying the potential damage in structures in their early stage. The research in SHM involves the analysis of a large amount of data. However; there is a lack of robust and user-friendly software packages that can be used by researchers and companies to process the SHM data efficiently. Usually; the researchers and companies have to develop their own implementation of data analysis algorithms or use software packages which are not specifically designed for SHM. Some commonly used techniques; such as system identification and signal processing algorithms; have been repeatedly implemented by different researchers and companies. The project aims to develop a universal and open-source software package that can benefit the researchers and industrial companies who are using sensor data for SHM purposes. The student is expected to build the framework of the open-source project. The software system should have the following characteristics: 1) Universality: The software system should be able to process data from different sensors and in different formats. 2) Expandability: Researchers and companies can easily expand the functionality of the software by developing based on the framework and/or contributing to the open-source project; 3) Robustness: The software should be able to implement SHM algorithms efficiently across different platforms.,QipeiMei,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,1.

32707,Organic Carbon Water Quality Analysis,Canada annually treats over 2900 million m3 of water for household use; with nearly 88% coming from surface water sources. Water contains a number of dissolved constituents including particulates; dissolved anions and cations; natural organic matter (NOM) and microbes. NOM is present in all surface and ground waters sources and consists of a range of compounds with a wide variety of chemical compositions and molecular sizes. The presence of NOM affects the colour; odor and taste of the water; in addition it is common precursor for disinfection by-products; and is a component of material that may cause negative operational issues with membrane technology. Characterization of NOM in terms of quantity and composition are useful in gaining insights into NOM pre and post various water treatment strategies. Working within the Basu Research Group alongside a talented group of graduate students; the MITACS intern will have the opportunity to learn about and become engaged with a variety of environmental engineering projects. In particular; the Globalinks Intern will be given a specialized project related to Environmental Water Quality in order to enhance their understanding of the analytical needs within the water sector. For this project; the intern will be tasked with assessing the movement of NOM type organic contaminants subject to various treatment processes. The intern will map characterization tools to the organics and develop a view of which analytical measurements provide key information on the pollutant movements through an environmental system. The Globalinks Intern will be working with a Total Organic Carbon Analyzer; UV-Vis Spectroscopy; Fluorescence Emission Excitation Spectroscopy; and High Performance Liquid Chromatography in order to develop a characterization map of various organics in water and wastewater systems.,OnitaBasu,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-13,A strong background in analytical methods related to chemistry is required for this position.

32708,Measuring insect emergence from wetlands as a valuable ecosystem service,Wetlands are valuable for many reasons; but the general public still thinks of them as wasted land that can be drained or paved over or otherwise treated poorly. We are aiming to change that by understanding the role of wetlands in supporting healthy ecosystems and figuring out if people care about some of the ecosystem services that they provide. Work underway this year is measuring the total mass of insects leaving wetlands; and measuring concentrations of helpful (omega-3 fatty acids) and harmful (pesticides) compounds in their bodies. Since these insects get eaten by birds; bats and fish; it is important to know if they are a healthy and nutritious food source. Next year (2024); we will use a semi-controlled study to determine if the widespread use of pesticides on farmlands is reducing insect emergence and contaminating this prey source; hindering the ability of wetlands to provide ecosystem services. Parallel surveys will ask the general public if they think wetlands are valuable; and through choice experiments provide a dollar value to some of these ecosystem services.,TimJardine,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student only needs to be comfortable in an outdoor setting with an interest in the natural world; and willing to spend days in the field wading in wetlands and collecting insects from traps.

32709,Active Transportation Longitudinal Aging Study (ATLAS): An examination of supportive infrastructure for age-friendly active transportation on cognition, physical and mental health,The current study unites multiple disciplines from psychology; civil engineering; exercise science and geography to examine the impact of supportive infrastructure for age-friendly active transportation (e.g.; protected cycling lanes and walkways) on longitudinal changes in cognitive function; physical health; and well-being among older adults. The proposed study uses objective geospatial information systems (GIS) mapping of the built environment to identify physical regions that are considered safe and accessible relative to regions with fewer supportive infrastructure for active transportation. Ambulatory cognition and self-reported physical activity and psychological well-being measures will be collected seasonally across 12 months using the MyCogHealth experience sampling app; a data collection tool that permits ongoing survey and cognitive assessments throughout daily life. The proposed study will involve a sample of older adults (N = 100) living in the Capital Regional District (CRD) that comprises 13 municipalities in Greater Victoria on the Southern tip of Vancouver Island; British Columbia. Each municipality varies in the density of cycling and walking infrastructure (e.g.; proportion of separated multi-use pathways). The study will contribute to our understanding of the role that built environments play in facilitating cycling and walking activity among older adults; and whether changes in these activities are systematically related to physical and mental health.,LauraMinet,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,The student is expected to have a strong interest in air pollution; transportation and public health.

32710,Enhancing Natural Killer cell-mediated immunotherapy by knocking out regulatory genes,Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T therapy is a revolutionary therapy in which T cells acquire an enhanced ability to attack cancerous cells using genetic engineering. CAR-T cell therapy is highly effective but very expensive; mainly due to the need to perform genetic engineering on patients' own T cells. In addition; CAR-T therapies often result in side effects; such as cytokine release syndrome and severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in allogeneic T cell infusion; impeding the enthusiasm for CART therapy. Recently; natural killer (NK) cells have been proposed as an alternative form of CAR therapy that can be used in an “off-the-shelf” allogeneic format without causing severe GvHD. Such CAR-NK therapies could dramatically decrease the cost and increase the affordability of cellular immunotherapies for cancer treatment. However; to play a critical role in anti-tumour activity; infused NK cells should persist. To increase in vivo persistence of NK cells; we are trying to knock out regulatory genes in NK cells using our recently developed Crispr-Cas9 method for editing NK cells. We expect the modified NK cells enhance their in vivo persistence and anti-tumour activity.,Seung-HwanLee,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-06,Cell Culture Techniques; Microscopy; Molecular Biology; Gene Cloning; Immunology; Cell Biology; Statistical analysis,Molecular Biology; Immunology; Biological Sciences
32711,Control of Floating Offshore Wind Farms,The goal of the research project is to develop controllers for floating offshore wind farms which optimize the efficiency of the farms.

32712,Development of self-healing geopolymers concrete composites,Geopolymers are an emerging environmentally friendly cementitious material that has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions associated with the production of Ordinary Portland Cement. They are considered a class of green inorganic polymers suitable for the construction and infrastructure industry. Geopolymers are produced by activating aluminosilicate precursors such as clays or industrial by-products like fly ash; concrete waste; blast furnace slag; red mud; etc.; using an activator solution and appropriate temperature conditions. These materials have gained significant traction in the infrastructure and construction sectors. For example; geopolymer was successfully utilized for an in situ concreting project at the Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport; involving approximately 40;000 m3 of material. However; a key challenge faced by geopolymers is their susceptibility to cracking and subsequent deterioration over time; which can compromise the structural integrity. To address this issue; the application of self-healing geopolymers has emerged as a potential solution for autonomously repairing cracks. Self-healing materials offer several advantages; including reduced monitoring and repair requirements; enhanced reliability; durability; and cost-effectiveness compared to conventional concrete. These intelligent materials draw inspiration from naturally occurring biological phenomena; such as the regeneration of new tissues to replace old and dead plant tissues. The objective of this project is to develop a self-healing geopolymer that can effectively repair mechanical damage and cracks. The candidate will conduct a comprehensive literature review to explore recent developments in self-healing geopolymers and concrete materials. Based on the findings; the candidate will select the most suitable methods and healing agents for the project. The self-healing properties of the developed geopolymers will be studied under accelerated aging conditions; including abrasions and scratches. The physical and mechanical properties of the self-healing geopolymers will be evaluated using the exceptional existing infrastructure at UQAC.,rezajafari,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Undergraduate student in Civil; ceramic; chemical and material engineering.

32713,RAN dataset generation and simulator,We have recently witnessed a surge in the number of ML applications that can be attributed to the increasing availability of data and compute capabilities. In this context; legacy communication systems were designed to satisfy a global QoS constraint and therefore the available data usually lacks granularity and can only be used for limited applications. Moreover; the available data is usually proprietary to communication service providers and are not widely accessible. Quite recently there has been an increasing amount of datasets being made available on data platforms; e.g. IEEE dataport; however; data is generally tailored for a specific application and cannot be used to train/test several ML solutions is a communication system. Despite their recent conception; generative adversary network (GAN) models have been widely used for the creation of accurate synthetic data in numerous domains. The wireless communication research is relatively behind; where this approach has only been used to generate specific data for a certain application and no general framework is available. This project will develop a wireless 5G and beyond (5GB) PHY and MAC layer data generation and simulator for ML applications. To achieved said task; the proposed generative models will be combined with simulations to generate all the necessary features. For instance; generative models can be used to generate data related to the channel quality; traffic; hardware imperfections; noise; environment conditions; user mobility; etc. However; this data needs to be combined with simulations to reach the output of the different steps in RAN/baseband.,BassantSelim,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,English,2024-05-01,The candidates should have an education in wireless communications or related field.

32714,Analysing quantum entanglement for quantum communication and quantum computing,In 1935 Einstein; Podolsky and Rosen described a paradox that led them to question the completeness of quantum mechanics. The EPR paradox arose from the fact that measurements of one member of a correlated (entangled) pair of quantum objects seem to instantaneously affect the other member; no matter how far away - an effect Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance'. Quantum entanglement is now known to play an important role in quantum computing and information processing. It may help to revolutionize computing and secure communication; and allow new tasks such as teleportation. This project will explore the nature of quantum correlations between multiple quantum bits (qubits). Correlations in systems of two particles have been studied in the past; due to the feasibility of performing experiments with photons; atoms; or ions. Recently we have begun to analyze quantum networks of three or more particles and we have explored new tasks such as quantum voting and controlled teleportation. The next steps will be to study other interesting systems of 3 or more parties in order to develop a general description of the N-party case. The students will study different measures of quantum correlations such as entanglement and Bell’s inequalities; and work with others to characterize quantum correlations and design and analyze novel communication protocols. He/she/they will experimentally explore quantum correlations and implement small-scale algorithms on the IBM quantum computer. They will explore long-debated questions about the nature of quantum mechanics and gain an understanding of this cutting-edge field. The outcomes of the project will help towards developing quantum technologies and the quantum internet.,Shohini Ghose,Ontario,Wilfrid Laurier University,English,2024-05-15,No skills available,None
32715,Quantum control of chaos for quantum computation and communication (1),The study of chaos theory has led to great progress in the modeling and control of various real-world systems including lasers; biological systems; robotics; signal processing and financial systems. The chaotic behaviour in these systems is characterized by their extreme sensitivity to small perturbations - a phenomenon popularly known as the butterfly effect. At the quantum level of atoms and photons; the concept of chaos is ambiguous due to the quantum uncertainty principle and the apparent linearity of quantum mechanical evolution. In this project; our goal is to characterize and control chaotic dynamics at the quantum level. These studies will give us a fundamental understanding of the connections between the microscopic quantum world and our macroscopic classical world. Furthermore; they will help to build a toolbox of quantum control necessary for a variety of future applications including ultra high-speed quantum computation; design of new molecules for chemical and biological purposes; precision measurements techniques; and quantum cryptography and security. This proposed research project will focus on analyzing a specific system called the quantum kicked top and developing a quantum simulation of it. Previously we have analyzed the effect of chaos on quantum correlations or entanglement - an important resource for quantum computing. The student will perform numerical simulations to identify and analyze this chaos in the quantum dynamics. This will include studies of entanglement and quantum phase transitions. The chaotic system we are studying has been experimentally implemented recently. The student will also have the opportunity to experimentally test the system in the IBM quantum computer. Our calculations will use experimentally feasible parameters and help guide future quantum control experiments.

32718,3D printing of architected biocomposites,Biobased materials; including biomass and wood pellets; are promising sustainable energy resources to replace expensive fossil fuels threatening our environment and global climate. Biobased residues and waste; as renewable multifunctional energy resources; cannot be only used for heating and power energy generation but also for greenhouse carbon dioxide enrichment and the improvement of soil structure via the biochar production. Thermochemical conversion of residues; using pyrolysis; gasification; and combustion; is among the typical approaches of biobased material utilization. Despite of remarkable potential of biobased materials as sustainable and renewable energy resources; enhancing their efficiency and reducing the toxic gas emission of this type of biofuels during the thermochemical conversion is essential to promote their commercial applicability. To reach these objectives; biobased materials are composed with a second agent. For instance; composite pellets of plastics and wood fibers are one of the industrialized alternative biomass with improved thermophysical properties. However; the energy sector still requires new composite biobased materials with optimized thermo-chemo-biological properties to increase their energy efficiency and decrease their negative environmental impact compared to conventional fossil fuels. The current research aims at developing novel composite biobased materials with an optimum combination of alternative constitutes. The research objectives are: 1) Multiphysics characterization of biobased pellets to identify biofuel compositions with dominant effects on thermal; chemical; and environmental properties. 2) Computational multiscale simulation of biobased composites for a wide range of constitute materials; particle size; and bulk geometry. 3) Developing a computational thermochemical model to simulate composite biobased materials in pyrolysis and gasification process. 4) Experimental studies on byproducts (biochar; syngas; and ash) of thermochemical conversion. 5) Conducting a multi-objective optimization to explore the optimum pellet geometry and volume fraction of material constituents to simultaneously maximize thermal energy generation and minimize the toxic gas emission during the utilization process.,AbdolhamidAkbarzadeh Shafaroudi,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-06-03,Due to the multidisciplinary framework of biobased composites; the research spans mechanical; biosystem; chemical; and civil engineering concepts and is also of interest to material scientists and mathematicians.

32726,Mobile App Coding/Development: The Linguistic Risk-Taking Initiative at the University of Ottawa,Are you a gamer? A software/app developer? Are you interested in languages? This project may be for you. It focuses on a new language-learning initiative at the officially bilingual English-French University of Ottawa (Canada). At this university; courses; programs; and services in both English and French are available. However; not all students are bilingual. Some may speak only or mostly English while others may speak only or mostly French. The university values and encourages bilingualism; and since all services are offered by bilingual staff members; opportunities for students to practice English or French; respectively; abound on campus. However; some students may be shy to practice the language they are learning in such real-life situations and may choose to remain in their linguistic comfort zone; that is; they may use only the language they are comfortable in; instead of the second official language that they need to practice. To encourage learners to practice their second language; the university has created a Linguistic Risk-Taking Passport App with various tasks and activities called risks. The risks represent daily-life communicative acts that learners may be otherwise shy to undertake in their second official language (e.g. speak their second language at the library; approach a passer-by for directions; order food at the cafeteria; interact with a professor/administrator; attend an event; amongst many others). Learners are asked to check-off risks they have undertaken in their apps and are eligible for rewards for taking risks as they help increase second language confidence and proficiency. Gaming elements are included (progressing through levels/trophies/badges; etc.).

32727,Fire-resistant self-decontaminating electrospun membrane for firefighter protective clothing,High exposure to carcinogenic chemicals generated during combustion have put firefighters at an increased risk of cancer compared to the general population. Although current firefighter protective clothing (FPC) can protect against high heat; liquids; and mechanical hazards; it shows limited protection against gases and vapors found in smoke. As a result; firefighters are at risk of dermal exposure to these compounds; which can easily penetrate protective clothing and accumulate on the skin. Inhalation exposure also creates a risk for firefighters; as carcinogenic particulate matter can be trapped within the FPC and later volatized; where it is inhaled by the wearer or those nearby the FPC. A method to improve protection against gas and vapor particles is needed to prevent exposure to carcinogens among firefighters. Electrospun membranes provide a unique opportunity to improve protection against gases and vapors without adding bulk or weight to the FPC. These membranes are composed of randomly oriented meta-aramid nanofibres which provide inherent flame resistance; light weight; and improved filtration. When added into the FPC; they will improve protection against aerosols due to their small pore size. To improve protection against gases and prevent delayed release of harmful vapors from trapped smoke particles; metal oxide nanoparticles will also be imparted into the nanofibrous membrane. These nanoparticles will catalyze reactions with the carcinogenic compounds; transforming them into less toxic byproducts. This project will proceed in multiple phases. During the preliminary phase; a method to electrospin meta-aramid nanofibres is achieved. As well; the best method to integrate nanoparticles into the nanofibrous membrane is determined. In the next phase; the function and durability of the membrane is determined by adapting textile test methods to nanofibrous materials. Finally; the last phase involves the integration of the membrane into the FPC to ensure its function and longevity within the clothing system.,PatriciaDolez,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-15,The student should have a solid background in polymer; textile; or material science.

32733,Fabrication and characterization of silicon-based thin film nanostructures,The incumbent will join an active research group involved in the fabrication and characterization of thin silicon-based films (oxides; nitrides; carbides; and combinations thereof); and the development of new materials structures based upon such films. There is great potential for the use of these materials in optical components for integrated optical applications or in solid state lighting devices. The project concerns the deposition of thin films with a range of compositions and refractive indexes; the characterization of the deposition process through optical techniques; and the correlation of the plasma characteristics with the physical and optical properties of the thin films. We also plan to explore the influence of the deposition temperature on the visible luminescence from such thin films by linking changes in the film properties; including hydrogen concentration; film microstructure; composition; and stress conditions to the observed changes of visible light emission.,PeterMascher,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,The student will gain hands-on experience with many tools of thin film fabrication and characterization; including plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition; reactive sputtering; photo- and electro-luminescence; and spectroscopic ellipsometry.

32734,Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy of Thin Film Structures,The McMaster Positron Laboratory is the only one of its kind in Canada and very few in all of North America. It includes the McMaster Intense Positron Beam Facility (MIPBF); which houses one of the world’s most intense sources of positrons; making the facility one of only a few of its kind operating worldwide. The MIPBF is made possible through a partnership with the researchers and staff of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor (MNR). The MIPBF infrastructure includes two experimental stations dedicated to materials research and thus; serves as a unique tool to meet the current and future demands for research in and characterization of advanced materials; with a focus on materials utilized in the development and fabrication of electronic and photonic devices. Our work is concerned with the characterization of defect structures – principally through positron lifetime and Doppler-broadening spectroscopy - in thin film and/or nano-structured materials utilized in the development and fabrication of electronic and photonic devices. In addition to positron annihilation spectroscopy; the student will gain hands-on experience with many "classic" tools of thin film and materials characterization; including photo- and electro-luminescence (P/EL); Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS); and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE).,PeterMascher,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,Strong interest in and an aptitude for experimental; hands-on work are required.

32741,Order-preserving automorphisms of free groups,There is a conjecture in 3-manifold topology called "the L-space conjecture" which says that certain groups that one derives from topological spaces should be left-orderable whenever the spaces have nice topological properties. This conjecture has been verified for many infinite families of groups and associated spaces using high-powered theorems; and verified in hundreds of thousands of special cases using direct computation (i.e. computer verification). Motivated by this conjecture; several authors have investigated the bi-orderability of knot and link groups in recent years. With numerous theorems in hand; many knot groups are now understood in this regard; but link groups cannot be dealt with using the same techniques. There are some results that are specifically designed to deal with links (for instance; recent work of Rolfsen and Kin) but there is an obstacle in this case which is not as easy to overcome as in the case of knots. The underlying algebraic difficulty is to determine a solution to the following problem: Given an automorphism f of a finitely generated free group; when does the free group admit a bi-ordering (or left-ordering) that is preserved by the automorphism? The goal of this project will be to develop a computer program that will be able to determine when an automorphism does NOT preserve an ordering of the free group; and to apply this program to many cases of interest (e.g. automorphisms arising from braids via Artin's representation). There are already partial results in this direction--for instance; theorems that tell you when an automorphism is not order-preserving based upon its action on the abelianization of the free group. However; I hope to use the program to try and conjecture a new obstruction to an automorphism being order-preserving; generalizing previous results and arriving at a new theorem.,AdamClay,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-06,Students will be required to have some advanced knowledge of group theory (e.g. free groups; group presentations; automorphism groups) and some skill in computer programming. Knowledge of topology; for instance knots; braids; or knot groups; is an asset; but not required.,Mathematics
32742,Signal analysis for tactile human-robot interaction detection based on sound,Physical interactions between robot and humans are typically measured using torque sensors at the robot joints; or a 6-axis force/torque sensor at the wrist of the robot. However; these sensors can be expensive; and not all robots are equipped with those. Additionally; they can only provide the general location of a contact: for example; somewhere on the arm or on the hand. Lacking more precise information; the ability of the robot to evaluate the intention behind the contact and to react appropriately is limited. In this project; we are exploring the use of microphones placed on the body of the robot to identify where contacts occur; from the sound that is produced when something touches the hard shell of the robot.,MarieCharbonneau,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,Prior knowledge of linear algebra; partial derivative equations; programming (Python and/or C); measurements; signal processing and system analysis will be of great help to complete this project!

32743,Application of Machine Learning to Aerodynamic Design of Autonomous Vehicles,Flow control has a tremendous technological and economic impact; such as aerodynamic drag reduction on road vehicles which translates directly into fuel savings; with a consequent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs. In recent years; machine learning has also been used to develop new approaches to flow control in place of more laborious methods; such as parametric studies. The applicant previously combined computational fluid dynamics and genetic algorithms to generate unique and non-intuitive aerodynamic device geometries; which were used to demonstrate significant aerodynamic benefits in terms of lift and drag reduction [1]. The applicant proposes to extend this work to machine learning applications to generate various devices in the given design space. In particular; to create three-dimensional flow control devices that are aerodynamically efficient in terms of the cost function (i.e.; aerodynamic drag and lift). In addition; autonomous vehicles rely heavily on the input of sensors to capture environmental and traffic data. However; the performance of these sensors degrades due to soiling caused by precipitation and surface contamination. Therefore; it is crucial to develop effective strategies to mitigate soiling and hence signal degradation. The proposed method will be used to generate unique geometries that are optimized to reduce drag; lift; and soiling simultaneously. This has not been done before and has the high potential to create novel aerodynamic devices with significant contributions to intellectual property. [1] R. Aranha; N. A. Siddiqui†; W. Y. Pao and M.

32745,Use of polymer and chiral layers to enhance the anomalous photo voltaic effect in Perovskite,Development of green energy sources is crucial to the progress of our society and multitude of avenues such as wind; solar; thermal and electrochemical are being researched for this purpose. Solar is a prime candidate due to its omnipresence on the planet and significant energy density. Increasing the efficiency of the solar cells along with ease of production is being actively pursued to make it cost effective in comparison to traditional carbon based fuel sources. Inorganic solar cells based on nanomaterials though efficient have higher costs due to the materials involved and the manufacturing process required. In this project the use of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in conjugation with polymers and chiral active molecules will be developed to enhance the performance and stability of the observed anomalous photovoltaic (APV) effect in perovskite based systems. The chiral effects will be used to improve device performance while polymer chains will enhance the stability of the device. The project will develop the integration of perovskite-polymer films with chiral active layers deposited in a spatially controlled manner. The device structure will be integrated with a high surface area metal oxide nanostructure (such as ZnO) for current collection and characterization of the chiral effects. The characteristics of the resulting chirality in the perovskite; the geometry of the nanostructure and the interface between the nanostructure and the perovskite-polymer will also be studied to increase the efficiency of the APV as a potential solar energy harvester. The candidate in particular will focus the efforts to study the formation and integration of the chiral layer with perovskite-polymer layer. The candidate will get experience on; in house synthesis and assembly methods for these devices and also their photo-electrical performance. Characterization methods such as field emission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction will be used at WatLabs facility at University of Waterloo.,Vivek Maheshwari,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-20,Undergraduate student with background in engineering; physics or chemistry will be considered for this position.

Prior research experience in nanomaterials such as quantum dots; nanowires though not necessary but will be useful for the project.,
32746,Development of advanced photon-detection techniques for neutrinoless double beta decay studies with nEXO,nEXO searches for 0nbb events in a liquid xenon time-projection chamber. Radioactive decays will produce an ionization signal and the emission of scintillation light at 175nm. Both of these signals have to be recorded. In order to greatly increase the sensitivity of nEXO compared to current 0nbb detectors; new and advanced photon sensors have to be developed; characterized and tested before they can be applied to nEXO to record the scintillation light. The challenge is identifying photon sensor that can be operated at liquid xenon temperatures (168K); and that are radio-pure without adding significant background to the 0nbb search. The collaboration has identified so-called Si photon multiplier (SiPM) detectors as the light detectors of choice and is pursuing their development. You will join the local EXO group at McGill; which focuses on integration of SiPMs into larger arrays and subsequent performance tests at room temperature and under cryogenic conditions. You will characterize UV light sources and use them to study SiPMs response functions at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures. This project touches all aspects of lab work with a hardware component as well as some simple data analysis.,ThomasBrunner,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-01,This project is aimed at undergraduate students at all levels; i.e.; no special skills are required.

Some knowledge in any of these programs/languages will help you get started; but is absolutely not required as we have local experts that are happy to assist you.,Physics
32747,Development of a Ba-ion tagging technique for the future nEXO detector,The search for neutrinoless double beta decays (0νββ) is extremely challenging. A unique advantage of a Xe time-projection chamber (TPC) detector is the possibility to locate the decay within the detector volume; and to extract into vacuum and identify Ba-136; the decay daughter of Xe-136. This so-called tagging possibility; combined with enough energy resolution to separate 0νββ from 2νββ decays; allows one to dramatically reduce the background of the measurement to virtually zero. The EXO collaboration has started development on nEXO; a multi-ton scale TPC. In addition; Ba-tagging techniques are under development. You will be working on the development of such a Ba-tagging technique with the EXO group at McGill. The focus of the development is the extraction of individual Ba-ions from xenon gas; i.e. the extraction of one ion from mols of xenon gas. We achieve this by using a radio-frequency ion-funnel and ion-manipulation techniques. So far; we could demonstrate that it is possible to actually extract ions from xenon gas of up to 10bar. The next step of the development will be the identification of the ion. In order to systematically study and optimize the ion-extraction mechanism; we will develop a laser-ablation ion source that will be placed in the xenon gas. A time-of-flight mass spectrometer is being developed to detect and identify the extracted ions. You will be working with other members of the group on SIMION simulations and the design of ion optics for the ion-extraction system. In addition; you will be involved in setting up hardware in the lab and testing ion-transmission efficiencies. For Ba-tagging; we are applying well established ion-manipulation techniques to further push the sensitivity of the future nEXO detector. This interdisciplinary research is very exciting because it applies different techniques to search for physics beyond the Standard Model.,ThomasBrunner,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-01,A general background of physics would be helpful in understanding the concepts of our setup. However; an interested and motivated student will pick up the details while working on the project. A general understanding of computers will be helpful. SIMION is a powerful ion trajectory simulation toolkit with a gui that is very intuitive. For the lab work; excitement and motivation are all you need. We will instruct you in how to assembel ultra-high vacuum systems and design experiments.,
32749,Restoration of eutrophic lake water,The project involves the monitoring of lake quality in an area outside of the city of Montreal. Too high levels of nutrients such as phosphorus lead to the growth of algae and blue-green algae at too high levels. Therefore; restoration of these lakes is a priority. Few technologies are currently available. However this project is related to the development of an in situ method for the treatment of these lakes. The lake water quality needs to be monitored to determine the most appropriate treatment method. Both on-site and laboratory testing are currently underway and will need to be continued to develop a full scale system.,CatherineMulligan,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-31,The background of the student should be in the area of environmental engineering or science and include familiarity with analyses of water such as methods for BOD; COD; suspended solids etc.,Engg-Enviromental; Environmental Studies
32750,Summer habitat associations of endangered bats on Canada’s prairie landscape.,Bats play a multitude of beneficial ecological roles. In tropical regions; for example; bats are important pollinators; seed dispersers and consumers of insects. In Canada; all resident bat species are insectivorous – consuming numerous insect pests. Of great concern is that an introduced disease (white nose syndrome (WNS); caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans) is leading to widespread and precipitous population declines. The population-level consequences of WNS are so severe (typically with >80% mortality following infection of hibernation sites) that three species of; previously assumed abundant; bats have recently been emergency listed as endangered. White nose syndrome was first detected New York and has since spread across much of eastern and central North America. It was recently detected in Saskatchewan. As a province with a vibrant agriculture sector; Saskatchewan stands to suffer severe economic consequences from a loss of bats (and the ecological services they provide). Two issues limit our ability to mitigate bat population declines in Saskatchewan: there is no known cure for WNS and our knowledge of bats in the province is severely limited (e.g.; Saskatchewan is the only province in which no hibernation sites have been identified). Consequently; the best management practices for bats here may be to identify and conserve summer habitat; so as to promote the survival and reproductive success of those few individuals that do survive WNS. In this project; the student will use a combination of acoustic monitoring; animal trapping and measurement; and engagement with local landowners to identify and conserve maternity roosts for one of the only endangered bat species in southern Saskatchewan - little brown bats.,JeffreyLane,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,These positions are best suited to applicants with interests in ecology; wildlife; field biology; and/or conservation biology. As evidence of this; applicants must either be enrolled in; or have graduated from; a relevant discipline. The fieldwork will involve regular vehicle travel to rural sites and; as such; successful applicants need to be able to cope under these conditions; have a valid driver’s license; be up-beat; positive; responsible; work well as a member of a team and be respectful. Evidence of these abilities (gained; for example; through previous involvement on field projects or extended back-packing trips) is required.,
32751,Disentangling genetic and environmental components of energetic trade-offs in mammalian reproduction: investigating North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus),Living organisms must strike a balance between energy acquisition and expenditure. To successfully survive and reproduce; organisms must employ behavioural and physiological strategies to optimize acquiring energy from the environment (which is frequently in limited supply); and selectively allocate its expenditure towards costly essential tasks such as somatic growth; maintenance; and reproduction. In long-lived iteroparous species; across years individuals may trade off reproduction in the current year to invest more in potential future reproduction; depending both on the condition of the individual and the surrounding environmental conditions such as food abundance and population density. Within years; individuals may shift their timing of reproduction to better match the energetically expensive aspects of reproduction (such as lactation) with seasonal environmental food abundance (i.e.; waiting until green up in the spring). Some of these strategies have a heritable genetic component but are labile in different environments. This study seeks to determine the relative contributions of genetic and environmental components to variation in energy expenditure and energy allocation towards reproduction. To do this; we study a population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in the southwest Yukon; Canada; that has been followed since 1987. We follow individuals from birth to death and gather extensive data on reproductive success and territory ownership; and we are able to quantify population- and individual-level food abundance in this food-caching species. We take tissue samples to construct a detailed pedigree; allowing us to take quantitative genetics approaches to studying phenotypic traits. Additional work related to this project will be quantifying metabolic rates and body condition to fully characterize energetic phenotypes of individuals to link back into data on relatedness and reproductive success.,JeffreyLane,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,The successful applicant will have completed relevant coursework in biology; ecology; evolution; and statistics.

32752,Impacts of climate change on health and wellbeing in LMICs,Climate change is known to have a number of impacts on human health (mortality and morbidity from heat; drought; floods; etc). Few studies have recognized the importance of empirical investigations of the impacts of climate change on psychological health and wellbeing. We explore these relationships in three countries in Sub Saharan Africa: Ghana; Kenya and Uganda. In so doing; our interdisciplinary team has measured psychological impacts of climate change at baseline and is in the process of developing interventions to address the psychological stresses of climate threats in order to facilitate good decision making in the development of resilience in these communities. In so doing; we focus on the most vulnerable populations identified in the UN Research Roadmap: women and girls; seniors; the poor. This research is undertaken in partnership with local policy makers and non-governmental organizations who can implement the results of the work in the form of policy and practice; and secure the sustainability of the resilience building process.,SusanElliott,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-06,The incumbent must have the following skills: good listening skills; good oral and written communications skills; be able to work well independently as well as part of a team; be ready to learn new skills: analysis; research; writing; research design.,Geography
32753,Structural biology of cancer cell signaling,Cancer cells have drastically altered cellular signaling compared to healthy cells which often arrise due to changes in protein and nucleic acid expression or mutations. These changes in cell signaling lead to increase proliferation; cell motility and invasion. Cellular signaling is carried out by a very diverse group of molecules with can sense the levels of different molecules inside and outside the cell and transmit this information to various cellular processes; such as transcription factors; epigenetic regulators; cytoskeletal remodeler; etc. We are interested in the molecular details of this signal integration and computation by protein and nucleic acid. We study two broad categories of molecules: 1. Rho activators Rho GTPases are a family of proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton. Due to their role in cell shape and movement; their activity is often increased in metastatic cells. This increase in Rho activity is often tied to hyperactivation of their upstream regulators; the RhoGEF family of protein. We aim to better understand the normal function of RhoGEF in the regulation of Rho activity and how these functions are altered in cancer cells. 2. Long non-coding RNAs LncRNAs are a family of large RNAs which are expressed; often at low levels; in a variety of cell types and accomplish a broad range of functions. Intriguingly; select lncRNAs have been proposed to interact directly with the signaling machinery and mediate changes in growth factors signaling; cytoskeletal remodeling and protein homeostasis. We plan on applying biochemical and structural characterization techniques to understand if lncRNAs are indeed acting as scaffolds for protein in cell signaling; and how their - often conserved - structure helps them carry out these functions.,MalikChaker-Margot,Québec,Université de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-06,We expect the student to have training in biochemistry and molecular biology; including laboratory experience; either through university classes or hands-on academic lab experience. The student ought to know how to use a micropipette; prepare chemical solutions; and have basic knowledge of nucleic acid and protein purification methods. Any prior experience on structural biology or biophysical techniques; such as electron microscopy; crystallography; biological molecule NMR; light scattering or calorimetry would be seen as a major asset. Cell culture will also be a significant component of the project so prior knowledge would be valued.,
32754,Next-generation bioengineered systems for sustainable production of bio-products from food waste,Food waste is a resource. It generates enormous energy; chemical and material potential due to the functionalized molecules stored in it. In Ontario alone; a staggering amount of 3.7 million tonnes/year of food and organic waste is generated (3.1 billion tonnes/year globally); however; it is currently underutilized; and about 60% of it ends up in landfills; which is not a sustainable option. Thus; this project aims to develop transformative and advanced bioengineered processes for sustainable biomanufacturing of liquid biofuel and bioplastics precursors via upcycling of food waste. Specifically; it is poised to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals 7; 9; 11 and 13 through advanced food waste biorefinery processes and high-value multi-product chain that will create economic benefits; promote advanced resource recovery and circular economy; and reduce environmental impacts. This will be achieved through bioconversion of food waste to carboxylates; which are high-value building blocks for synthesis of a wide array of currently fossil-fuel derived products such as polymers (plastics); alcohols (e.g.; bio-butanol as biofuel); ketones and olefins. This will be achieved via mixed culture fermentation to convert food waste to carboxylates; which are high-value building blocks for above products. However; this biosynthesis poses separation and recovery challenges. Carboxylates are usually present in diluted form which make their separation more difficult and expensive. Most extraction studies have employed synthetic acid solutions while reports on mixed acid recovery from real fermentation broth are scarce. Furthermore; the carboxylates inhibit the metabolic functions of microorganisms. Consequently; only low carboxylate yields and productivities can be obtained. Such limitations can be overcome by in-situ product recovery (ISPR) i.e.; removal of carboxylates as they are being formed in fermenter. Thus; the objective of this project is to develop efficient ISPR systems using green extractants for high recovery of carboxylates and their further conversion to secondary bioproducts (bioplastics).,GuneetKaur,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Selected candidate is expected to possess a knowledge of chemical (or bio) separations or extractions; downstream bioprocessing; analytical chemistry; and mass transfer. Hands-on skills in setting up chemical dilutions; molarity and concentration calculations are needed.

32755,Analytical modelling of the fluid dynamics of multiple-vortex tornadoes // Modélisation analytique de la dynamique des fluides des tornades à tourbillons multiples,Tornadoes are a fascinating feat of nature. A single supercell thunderstorm can even develop multiple tornadoes that interact with each other. In such an event; the weaker tornadoes (satellite tornadoes) will revolve around the much larger primary tornado. Another lesser-known phenomenon is also possible. A tornado can in fact possess multiple smaller tornadoes within itself; each of which revolve around the centre of the parent tornado. These internal tornadoes are known as subvortices or suction vortices and the parent tornado as a multiple-vortex tornado. Multiple-vortex tornadoes are among the largest; strongest and most destructive tornadoes known to date. Why is this so? Despite their destructive reputation; the behaviour of multiple-vortex tornadoes remains poorly understood. A study of the fluid dynamics of multiple-vortex tornadoes can provide valuable insight into how they behave and therefore serve to inform risk management and evacuation strategies in practice. The objective of this research project is to develop a fundamental analytical model of multiple-vortex tornadoes. The analytical model will consist of a set of n irrotational point vortices (the subvortices) embedded within a background rigid body rotation (the parent vortex). We will first study stable systems of two and three vortices using their potential and stream functions as well as their circulation and vorticity. We will also perform more advanced fluid dynamic analyses to further describe the physics such as modal decomposition and extraction of material curves. We will then model hypothetical attenuation and intensification processes between stable systems of two and three vortices. As part of this work; the flow of stable and transitioning systems of two and three vortices have previously been acquired using a simple experimental model. The experimental data will serve as a means of comparison for the analytical model.,GiuseppeDi Labbio,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-06-03,The student should have a good understanding of undergraduate fluid mechanics (e.g.; velocity fields; potential function; stream function).

32757,Designer Materials to Meet Tomorrow's Needs,This project will pursue materials by design that aim to meet the challenges of tomorrow's applications in energy conversion; energy storage; and high durability nanoscale sensors. We will meet these challenges through the synthesis; assembly and other soft manipulations of matter; creating materials that have the desired properties and structures. For example; we will pursue a customized porous material that will serve as a platform to build upon our understanding of the dynamics of transport within energy conversion and energy storage materials. This work will also pursue an understanding of how materials behave under extreme conditions of temperature; pressure and corrosive environments that the materials will likely encounter within these applications. Of equivalent importance is to understand impurities and defects in these materials; which will have widespread importance in long-term stability. Through this work we aim to develop the most efficient and durable materials for use in electrocatalysis; and highly sensitive materials for chemical sensing. Through the design of the custom materials; we aim to improve the sensitivity of detection in the hopes of extending electrochemical and optoelectronic sensing applications to a number of trace analytes. Aside from these areas of research we are also developing sensing materials for incorporation into flexible electronic platforms. Sensors are ubiquitous to our daily lives and we aim to improve the performance of materials incorporated into these devices to enable operation under extreme conditions. In this work; we aim to prepare materials for in-the-field work; to improve the lives of humanity through enhanced sensing devices; and to optimize energy storage and conversion in materials as demand increases for both applications. We seek these solutions through designing materials to meet these challenges while also understanding the fundamentals behind these materials; their limitations and their benefits.,ByronGates,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,I look for a student that is self-motivated to learn; curious about science; and aspiring for continual self-improvement. They will need to be willing to work on and lead their own project; while also managing their schedule to work collaboratively with other students in the research group.

I also look for a student that is safety conscious. Importantly; I also seek someone that is creative and a problem solver.,
32758,Computational Enzymology: modelling potential enzymatic drug targets in pathological bacteria,We are facing a global health crisis; the rise of drug-resistant pathogens. As a result; our global society faces the real prospect of returning to a time when common diseases; that are presently easily treatable; could again become deadly. Hence; there is a need to identify; characterize and/or design new therapeutic agents and their targets. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a class of enzymes found in all living organisms. Furthermore; they have been found to have a broad range of biochemically essential roles.1 While they are perhaps best known for their critical role in protein biosynthesis; they are now known to be involved in a range of important physiological processes including viral assembly; porphyrin biosynthesis; inflammation; and apoptosis. Mechanistically; it is known that they catalyse the aminoacylation of their corresponding transfer-RNA (tRNA). First; they catalyse the activation of their respective amino acid by reacting it with ATP to give an aminoacyl-adenylate derivative. The latter is then reacted with their respective tRNA to give the desired aminoacylated-tRNA species.1 It is only quite recently that we have begun to more fully understand the atomistic details of the catalytic mechanisms. For instance; it has been shown that many aaRS's have not only an aminoacylation activation/transfer active site; but also an editing site. The former catalyses the amino acid activation and subsequent aminoacylation of the tRNA. In contrast; the latter site catalyses the removal of incorrect aminoacyl groups from aminoacylated-tRNA. As a result; aaRSs present potentially rich targets for therapeutic agents. However; to date; only a few drug agents that target aaRS's; in any organism; have been identified. In this project; building upon our recent studies and consequently greater understanding oof the catalytic and editing mechanisms of several related aaRS (e.g.; MetRS; LeuRS and ValRS); we will use computational chemsitry to identify potential new therapeutic drugs.,JamesGauld,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-06,The student should have a broad knowledge of fundamental chemical principles; e.g.; knowledge of organic; inorganic and physical chemistry.

32759,Exploring the connectivity and resilience of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease,Dopamine neurons in the brain are particularly vulnerable and degenerate in Parkinson's disease. We hypothesize that their great vulnerability results in part from their very complex connectivity and from the high level of oxidative stress that results from an hyperactive mitochondrial network. This project will make use of mouse primary dopamine neurons to examine some of the molecular mechanisms that drive the axonal branching of dopamine neurons and the high activity of their mitochondria. We will also explore the ability of small molecules to increase the resilience of dopamine neurons by acting on mitochondria to improve their efficiency to produce ATP or their ability to handle oxidative stress. The experiments will be performed using molecular approaches such as viruses to manipulate gene expression; genetically-encoded sensors of mitochondrial function and of oxidative stress and confocal imaging techniques.,Louis-EricTrudeau,Québec,Université de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The student is expected to have basic university undergraduate training in the fields of biology; neuroscience; cell biology and pharmacology. The rest of the more advanced training will be provided during the internship. A high level of motivation and enthusiasm for science is also expected.,
32760,Quebecol metabolism and potential neuroprotective properties,We are investigating the liver metabolism of the natural product quebecol and have determined that quebecol mainly undergoes Phase 2 glucuronide conjugation in vitro. Surprisingly; quebecol does not undergo Phase 1 metabolism to a reactive para-quinone methide. We attempted to prepare para-quinone methide standards of quebecol using chemical oxidation methods; but instead produced catechols that subsequently underwent intramolecular cyclization. We would like to determine how this intramolecular cyclization occurred and whether 5 or 6 membered rings were formed or if coupling between aromatic rings occurred. This project would involve the synthesis of model di-catechol diphenylethane analogues of quebecol that would allow for identification and a full characterization of these products using nmr and mass spectrometry. We anticipate that fragment ions identified during the mass spectrometric characterization would provide us with a diagnostic method to rapidly distinguish between the different ring products and be used as a tool when investigating the quebecol products. In addition; the student would determine the rates of these cyclization reactions to better understand the relative formation of aromatic coupling products and 5 and 6-membered ether rings. This research is important as analogues of quebecol are being prepared elsewhere as potential therapeutic compounds and a thorough understanding of the factors influencing metabolic and oxidative reactions will be important for both safety and pharmacological assessment of these analogues. We will also assess the ability of the di-catechols to form reactive intermediates; such as ortho-quinones; through trapping experiments with glutathione. Finally; simple diphenylethane di-catechols have been shown to inhibit in vitro aggregation of alpha-synuclein; a protein involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. In order to better understand the importance of di-catechols to this process; alpha-synuclein aggregation studies with the di-catechol diphenylethane analogues will be carried out.,EdKrol,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,The student should have knowledge of organic and analytical chemistry; additional knowledge of biochemistry or xenobiotic metabolism would also be helpful but is not required.

32762,Geopolymer and superplasticizer,Large CO2 emission; climate change; and quarry depletion together with soaring demand for housing; accommodation; and infrastructure have led to a large body of research on sustainable alternative construction materials to curtail cement production. According to the researchers; geopolymer is one of the most potential and cleanest materials to partially or completely substitute cement. According to the literature; coal fly ash is the most interesting precursor material for geopolymer. However; excessive usage of the coal fly ash in the construction sector has led to the scarcity and increased price of this material. On the other hand; wood fly ash produced by the pulp and paper mill industry has the capability of substituting coal fly ash in geopolymer production. Despite the benefits introduced by the abundance and waste nature of wood fly ash-based geopolymer; the relatively large quantity of alkaline activator needed in the production process can seriously hinder its vast usage. This study aims to reduce the amount of alkaline activator by using superplasticizers employed in cement-based concretes. The effect of different types of superplasticizers such as sulfonated melamine-formaldehyde condensate; sulfonated naphthalene-formaldehyde condensate; polycarboxylate; and polycarboxylate ether on such properties as setting time; flowability; compressive; and tensile strength of the geopolymers will be studied. As a result of this project; wood fly ash-based geopolymers will be more suitably formulated for usage in construction projects and the optimum amount of alkaline activator and superplasticizer will be identified.,SumiSiddiqua,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,The intern needs to have a great perseverance and enthusiasm for the sake of the research project.

Furthermore; the student is required to attend weekly research group meetings and to protect confidential research outcomes of the project.,
32763,Evaluation of Seasonal Effects on Biopolymer treated soils,Many indicators such as more frequent heatwaves; changing precipitation patterns; and reduced snow and ice cover now clearly show that Canada’s climate is changing. Civil engineering projects such as roads and embankments on clay soils; together with climate warming; can lead to deeper freezing during winter months and thawing during summer months. These seasonal cycles can produce large vertical and horizontal deformations that are only partly recoverable and thus affecting their long-term stability or durability. Sustainable engineering discourages the use of conventional soil stabilizers such as lime and cement owing to their higher carbon emission rates. To address these challenges; many researchers considered practical uses of microbiological techniques to improve the strength and durability properties of geomaterials. Through the laboratory-based experiment program; this study will investigate the utilization of xanthan gum; an eco-friendly biopolymer obtained from microbial sources; for the stabilization of clay soils. The mixing of xanthan gum biopolymer has been reported to form cementitious products that fill the pores of the soil structure; yielding a denser soil fabric with stronger attractive forces. The study will be focused to understand the effect of drying-wetting and freeze-thaw cycles on straining developed in soft clay layers under idealized repetitive traffic loading conditions using a series of macroscale and microscale test approaches. The purpose of this research is to discover innovative materials for an effective; sustainable; and resilient build environment as well as to promote the production of bio-based materials that can be fit to the principles of the circular economy. Many factors that will be investigated in this research is novel to the literature and will be the first step to exploring bio-based stabilizer for their possible applications to the service settlements of highways; runways; and metro rail tracks under the impact of adverse climate change.,SumiSiddiqua,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,The intern needs to have a great perseverance and enthusiasm for the sake of the research project.

The influence of hemp waste inclusion on the mechanical and hygrothermal properties of rammed earth will be assessed based on laboratory experiments. This study is inspired by the environmental and energy saving criterions for buildings based on clean energy concept; as well as the economic interests based on the circular economy model. The innovative applications of plant waste-based organic raw materials in the green building sector not only helps to combat climate changes by reducing the carbon dioxide emissions; but also has a positive health impact.,SumiSiddiqua,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,The intern needs to have a great perseverance and enthusiasm for the sake of the research project.

32765,Immigration in Brazil and Canada,This project will be done in collaboration with researchers (Dr. Bruning and Dr. Ragnini) at the Universidade Federal do Parana. Research done in Brazil (Faria et al.; 2021) suggests that many immigrants arriving in Brazil from other countries in the Global South see Brazil as a transitory country and hope to migrate to North America for long-term settlement. This desire stems from an undeveloped settlement system that results in immigrants experiencing precarity characterized by a lack of security; predictability; and protection (Schierup et al.; 2015; p. 2; Standing; 2011). This project employs a multilevel framework comprising several levels of subjectivity (individual; interactional; organizational; and societal) (Nardon and Hari; 2022) to understand and compare Brazil and Canada's immigrant work integration ecosystem. We analyze the implications of experiences of precarity in immigrants' mental and physical health and its impact on long-term settlement. We see precarity as a labour condition and an ontological and embodied experience (Neilson & Rossiter; 2008). The ontological experience of precarity is woven into memories; experiences; aspirations; and practices of resistance. The embodied experience of precarity is marked on the flesh of living labour – the workers’ body (Tsianos & Papadopoulos; 2019). We will explore the role of macro discourses and policy frameworks; key organizational players such as universities; employers; and community organizations; and individual experiences across both countries to understand the factors implicated in precarization; mental health; and multi-step migration trajectories. We will draw on literature; previous data collected in Canada by the applicant and in Brazil by the partners; new data collected from public texts; demographic and economic data; and interviews with key informants. The project relates to the following UN´s Sustainable Development Goals: (3) Health and Well-Being; (8) Decent Work and Economic Growth; (10) Reduction of Inequalities; (16) Peace; Justice and Effective Institutions.,LuciaraNardon,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,The ideal student for this project can work well independently and as part of a team and has some experience and skills in the following areas: • Excellent written and oral communication in English and Portuguese • Knowledge of qualitative research methods • Knowledge of ethical research principles • Understanding of theoretical frameworks related to mental health • Understanding of the migration system in Brazil (policies; practices; and discourses) • Ability and experience working with vulnerable populations • Interviewing skills (in English and Portuguese) • Experience engaging in academic literature reviews,Psychology
32766,IoT based platform for serviceability performance monitoring of mass timber buildings,Mass timber building is gaining increasing interest and a growing market in North America. The high stiffness-to-density ratio makes wood resilient to earthquakes; however; causing challenges in meeting serviceability requirements; such as wind-induced vibration in tall wood buildings; human-induced vibration of floor systems; and the sound transmission between rooms. The research program is to develop serviceability design guidance for tall wood buildings by understanding the dynamic properties of both whole buildings and components through laboratory and in situ measurements and numerical modeling. At the same time; we try to develop a mass timber building performance monitoring and assessment platform based on IoT which can be used to collect post-occupancy performance physical data and subjective comfort data. The data will then be used to assist decision-making in the design stages and to develop physics-informed data-driven design methods to achieve satisfactory serviceability performance in mass timber buildings.,JianhuiZhou,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Civil and Mechanical Engineering should have a solid background in mechanics; and preferably knowledge of dynamics and vibration.

32767,EmoSense: Predicting Stress and Engagement through Physiological Bio-Signals and Facial Gesture Recognition,The aim of our research project; "EmoSense;" is to utilize wearable Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors; along with a camera system; to accurately measure and quantify the physiological response to engagement in games delivered via a robotic system or a virtual reality (VR) environment. We intend to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) techniques; specifically feature extraction and classification using deep learning methods; to analyze the real-time data obtained from GSR; PPG; and facial gesture recognition systems. By combining multiple physiological indicators and facial expressions; we seek to develop a comprehensive framework that provides a more nuanced understanding of user engagement during interactive experiences. The GSR sensors will capture changes in skin conductance; reflecting the emotional arousal and stress levels of the participants. Simultaneously; PPG sensors will enable the measurement of heart rate and blood flow; providing additional insights into the participants' physiological states. Moreover; our project will employ a camera system to detect and track facial gestures; allowing us to analyze expressions such as smiles; frowns; and eyebrow movements. These facial expressions serve as valuable indicators of emotional states and can offer a deeper understanding of the participants' engagement levels. Through the integration of AI techniques; we will develop algorithms capable of extracting meaningful features from the collected data and applying classification models to accurately quantify user engagement. The real-time analysis will enable us to provide immediate feedback and adaptive responses; enhancing the interactive experience for the participants. Ultimately; the EmoSense project holds significant potential in various domains; such as gaming; virtual reality applications; human-computer interaction; and affective computing. The insights gained from this research can contribute to the development of more immersive and engaging experiences while also informing fields like mental health; user experience design; and personalized learning environments.,MiladNazarahari,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Possessing all of the skills listed below is not a prerequisite but can be beneficial. - Understanding of Physiology: familiarity with physiological concepts related to emotions; stress; and engagement. - Signal Processing and Data Analysis: familiarity in signal processing techniques and data analysis methods (e.g.; filtering; feature extraction; time-series analysis).

32769,Expanded tubes,The nuclear; oil and gas industries often experience shutdowns due different types of failures. The main cause of failure of tube-to-tubesheet joints is due to mechanical loading under harsh environmental conditions. The stress corrosion cracking enhanced by the relatively high residual stresses and plastic deformations generated during the expansion process is considered the most critical type of failure. They are the very weak link between the heat transfer process thermos-fluids and separation boundary. The complex elasto-plastic behavior of the expanded joint and the lack of a proper design procedure of the expansion process are the two main factors contributing to the low quality and low performance of this kind of assembly. The inadequacy of a proper control of the residual contact pressure during the process of expansion gives rise to higher residual stresses that make the joint vulnerable and prone to leakage failure. Although their use is still very popular even today; their fabrication is still based on trial and errors and internal recipes that are not made publically available by manufacturers. It is proposed to study the elasto-plastic behavior and the residual stress state by modelling the expanded joint behavior during the expansion process as well as during operation both analytically and numerically. Such a study would provide general guidelines on how to control the expansion process and help the design engineer to predict accurately the residual stresses that are the major source of stress corrosion cracking and leakage failure.,HakimBouzid,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-15,The candidate must have a good knowledge of stress analysis and have used in the past a general purpose finite element program such as ANSYS; ABAQUS; LS-DYNA etc....,

32773,Translating Quantum Mechanical Molecular Models into Chemical Language,In quantum mechanics; substances are composed of electrons bound by atomic nuclei. This viewpoint is extremely powerful; and underlies modern computational approaches to electronic structure theory; e.g. quantum chemistry. These approaches—using methods like density-functional theory—are unquestionably useful; and are sufficient to provide quantitative information about energies; molecular responses; and electron distribution functions for almost all the molecules and materials of routine chemical interest. However; these computational methods and the results therefrom are in opposition to the language and concepts of chemistry. In quantum mechanics; there are no atoms; functional groups; or chemical bonds; there are no inductive effects or steric effects; there is no electronegativity or hardness; there is no electrophilicity or nucleophilicity. This makes it very challenging to gain chemical insight using modern computational quantum chemistry methods. The goal of this project is to try to translate the (numerical) output of quantum chemistry methods into the language of chemistry. The primary goal is to formulate a mathematical description of a chemical concept; implement it into the ChemTools package (www.chemtools.org); then test the concept on a database of molecules. Depending on student interests; different facets of this research workflow (mathematical modelling; computer programming; high-performance computing) can be emphasized. The project would occur under the QC-Devs (qcdevs.org) umbrella; so there will be ample resources/support for all facets of the project.,PaulAyers,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,The student should have at least one year of chemistry at the university or advanced high-school level.

32774,New Machine Learning Methods for Molecular Potential Energy Surfaces,Traditional computational approaches for modelling molecules and materials are thwarted by the inevitable tension between cost and accuracy. It is relatively easy to generate low-accuracy results; but increasing the accuracy and reliability of these results requires directly solving the Schrödinger equation to find the wavefunction and/or the partition function. In machine-learning approaches; one does not attempt to computationally evaluate mathematical models for the underlying physics; but instead tries to deduce results from data. Such an approach can be used either to avoid costly computations. The specific goal of this project is to model isomerization reactions: Modelling molecular rearrangements directly is extremely difficult because it is difficult to; a priori; predict what sorts of rearrangements might occur. This is particularly true of molecular rearrangements under extreme conditions and/or geologic time scales. As part of our research with the Origins Institute; we seek to model these sorts of processes; so that we can understand how the few-atom molecules that were abundant in the early days of the Solar System combined and rearranged to form the biological precursor molecules. There are also interesting applications to environmental (especially atmospheric) reactions of pollutants and fragmentation patterns in mass spectrometry. To achieve this goal; we need to accurately solve the Schrodinger equation for specific molecular structures and then combine the data from these solutions to provide a complete global model for the molecular potential energy surface; which is the key quantity that undergirds chemical reactions (including chemical kinetics; equilibrium; and thermodynamics) and intermolecular interactions (including binding affinities; crystallization; solubility; etc.).,PaulAyers,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,The student should have knowledge and familiarity with statistics; calculus; and linear algebra. It will be very helpful if the student also knows about scientific/mathematical programming and computer scripting; but any student with interests and skills in mathematics and/or computational modeling; however; could be productive.,
32775,New Machine Learning Methods for Predicting the Effectiveness of Drug Candidates,The goal of this project is to develop accurate and efficient ways to estimate the properties of molecules and materials in cases where rigorous computational approaches are either impractical or impossible. To do this; we will adapt recent theoretical and computational advances in machine learning methods to the problem of property prediction. The specific approach we plan to use is called kriging; or Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes corresponds to a neural network of infinite width or infinite depth; and while it is the best linear unbiased estimator for properties; it is too expensive for routine use with large datasets. However; for many applications in (bio)chemistry; where experimental data is scarce; Gaussian processes is believed to be the best possible machine-learning method. To use Gaussian processes to predict difficult-to-measure medicinally-relevant properties like toxicity; bioavailability; and drug binding affinity; one needs to quantify the similarity of different molecules: similar molecules will have similar properties. Specifically; we use a quantitative measure of the “dissimilarity between molecules.” Our specific approach is based on measuring the surface properties of molecules; as these properties are usually the most relevant properties for determining interactions with other biomolecules. The task of the student is to take a pharmacologically relevant property; find a database of experimental data for training (or use one of the properties/datasets we already have in hand); and then compute molecular surface descriptors and dissimilarities; so that a computational model for property prediction can be formulated. Of special interest are toxicity; blood-brain-barrier permeability; bioavailability; and drug-binding affinity.,PaulAyers,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,The student should have knowledge and familiarity with statistics; calculus; and linear algebra. It will be very helpful if the student also knows about scientific/mathematical programming and computer scripting; but any student with interests and skills in mathematics and/or computational modeling; however; could be productive.,
32776,Developing Software to Gain Chemical Insights from Quantum Chemistry Calculations,The immediate outputs of quantum chemistry calculations are approximate energy and wavefunction for a chemical substance. However; extracting a molecule’s intrinsic chemical characteristics from the gigabytes of raw numerical wave-function data is neither unique nor straightforward; because chemical concepts (e.g. atoms & bonds) do not correspond to well-defined observables in quantum mechanics. This has led to a proliferation of post-processing methods for interpreting the wave-function in terms of chemical language. Unfortunately; only a limited number of these interpretive tools; and rarely the most modern ones; exist in quantum chemistry packages. To bridge this gap; stand-alone software packages have been developed to take the numerical output of quantum chemistry packages to further extract chemical concepts. However; most of these packages have a narrow scope; follow old-style coding practices; and are monolithic and unfit for testing ideas and active development. This led us to the development of the free and open-source ChemTools software package (https://chemtools.org/) to make it easy for theorists to test and implement new ideas and non-specialists (e.g. experimental or computational chemists) to use the most recent tools from conceptual quantum chemistry in their research/teaching. In doing so; ChemTools strives to provide unbiased support for all mathematically rigorous post-processing tools defined within the conceptual quantum chemistry research field and complement various quantum chemistry software packages. ChemTools emphasizes on principles of sustainable software development and is well-tested; well-documented; and user-friendly. The specific aim of this project is developing; implementing; and testing novel tools for visualizing molecular orbitals and analyzing their interactions to understand chemical reactivity. This project has multiple facets including mathematical development (converting the chemical problem to a mathematical problem); software implementation (programming mathematical equations within the HORTON and ChemTools packages); and computational modeling (running calculations and analyzing results) of molecular reactivity.,FarnazHeidar-Zadeh,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-15,The student with the proper background will get trained during the first few weeks to successfully perform the project during the internship period.

32777,Physics-Based Machine-Learning Models: Combining Speed and Accuracy in Computational Chemistry,Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly prevalent in chemistry; promising a powerful alternative tool for addressing problems of chemical significance. ML algorithms automate analytical model building; enabling computers to find hidden patterns by iteratively learning from training data without being explicitly programmed. Recent advances in ML algorithms and the abundance of computational data have enormously expedited the training of novel ML algorithms to circumvent costly quantum-mechanical calculations. This success has lead to big promises by ML proponents in theoretical chemistry. However; these models are only suitable for interpolation and fail to scale to larger systems. That is; when a model is trained on small-to-medium-size molecules; it can only be applied to systems of similar size. Modeling long-range intermolecular interactions with machine learning (ML) requires sampling the vast diversity of chemical environments occurring on an extended length scale. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the required amount of training data. This specific project incorporates physical knowledge into the machine-learning modeling process to achieve the accuracy of high-level quantum chemistry at the cost of molecular mechanics; this is philosophically different from the commonly used “black box ML modeling”. This not only allows one to compute interaction energies of large molecules (e.g. drug-target binding) and run long-time molecular dynamics simulations of (macro)molecules but also enables accurate and efficient computational screening of large databases to select the most promising molecules for follow-up experiments.,FarnazHeidar-Zadeh,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-15,The student with the proper background will get trained during the first few weeks to successfully perform the project during the internship period.

32779,Taiwan Stands With Ukraine,On February 24; the Russian Government Genocide of the People of Ukraine entered a new stage: the physical elimination of Ukrainians from their homeland on all territories of Ukraine. In one month; more than 25% of the total population of Ukraine (+10 Million People) has been displaced; and thousands have died. The global community has seen the thread that Russia created in the democratic world; and democratic governments worldwide joined the global movement to stand with Ukraine. The project is designed to document how Taiwan stands with Ukraine and what initiatives has been created in Taiwan to support people of Ukraine. It is also essential to note the efforts of global communities to stop the war and recognize its worldwide impact on how to support displaced populations.,OleksandrKondrashov,British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-01,Ideally; the student should be from the School of Social Work in Taiwan and interested in the Ukrainian-Taiwan community development.

32780,Energy-Efficient, City-Scale Point Cloud Compression on Heterogeneous Laptops,Last year; Intel released their newest computer processor; making it even harder for software to scale as well as hardware will allow. You see; with their "Alder Lake" generation; Intel switched to a big.LITTLE design where different cores have different strengths; invalidating the classic (i.e.; pre-2022) PRAM view that all parallel cores are the same. (This already was wrong for phones and for memory.) It's yet another step in a multi-decade trend towards ubiquitous heterogeneous computing. Our work is on energy-efficient analytics for large datasets. Specifically; we want to compress really large 3D point clouds (say; covering the entirety of metro Vancouver) into smaller; realistic approximations that require much less energy and power to analyse. This compression is quite expensive and required us to adapt (or; more accurately; completely redesign!) algorithms to take better advantage of parallelism; it has applications in computer graphics; AR/VR; digital twinning; and gaming. While our algorithm redesign was quite successful; it is clear that we have missed a lot of potential on 2022-vintage computers by using different cores more strategically. In this project; you would investigate what we had missed: how can we adapt this point cloud compression algorithm for a mixture of "performance" and "efficiency" cores? The goal would be to achieve similar run time performance but with less energy. It is possible to decide which threads run on which cores and it is possible to decide which parallel tasks are executed by which threads. The research would involve deeply studying the problem to understand how to map algorithmic work to specialties of cores; adapting (or redesigning?) our parallel algorithm; implementing your algorithmic ideas into our pre-existing C++/OpenMP code base; and running experiments to evaluate performance relative to cost. Positive results in this direction could inspire rethinking how most parallel algorithms are designed.,SeanChester,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-06,For this project; interns should: * have a first-rate standing in their study program * be comfortable with the C++ programming language; including the use of STL; smart pointers; and multi-threading (or equivalent knowledge) * have good communication skills in English; both written and verbal * be comfortable working under the guidance of and in collaboration with a multi-cultural team * have an interest in nuanced data structure design and empirical evaluation * be eager to learn and to follow through independently on tasks * access to an "Alder Lake" generation Intel laptop/computer (or newer),Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Engineering; Engg-Software; Engg-Electrical

32785,Trans-national Indigeneity, Displacement, and Patriarchy,This research project is informed by the author’s lived experience as a Black Indigenous Liberian migrant woman in Canada. The research also builds upon her PhD dissertation entitled: Systematic Violence and the Rule of Law: Indigenous Communities in Post-war Liberia and Australia. The peculiarity of the doctoral dissertation lies in documenting and validating Indigenous Peoples collective experiences with colonial violence impacted by “rule of settler law”; land dispossession; forced displacement; systemic racism; and ongoing exclusion from the nation-building building process. This unique experience of Indigenous Peoples the world over converges at the imposition; transplantation; and dominance of oppressive settler law on Indigenous communities marked by the persistence of intergenerational trauma despite their resistance and advocacy. Assessing displaced Indigenous peoples’ experience in Canada and elsewhere will affirm that Indigenous Peoples unified by their shared experiences despite inter- and intra- group differences can unshackle the indelibility of systemic colonial violence by adopting a holistic research approach. Four critical inquiries emerge in this research: 1) an assessment of whether Indigenous identity can be defined by genetics; geographical boundary; a spiritual connection to the land via ancestral; physical; and ceremonial traditions; Eurocentric patriarchal colonialism; shared global experiences; or transplant of settler law; 2) understanding the impact of intergenerational trauma on displaced Indigenous girls and women who are survivors of systemic violence; 3) documenting survivorship experience to give agency to displaced Indigenous peoples in owning their stories and charting the path they want; and 4) disrupting and deconstructing patriarchal norms across institutional; cultural; and community settings using attributes of transformational leadership for social change. Therefore; in documenting; establishing; and acknowledging the experiences of displaced world Indigenous citizens and transnational Indigenous Peoples; the research examines the multiplicity of indigeneities in Liberia; Canada; Ghana; Australia; Zimbabwe; and the United States; and Zimbabwe using a complex (mixed method).,VeronicaFynn Bruey,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Be a postgraduate student in law; public health; Indigenous studies; gender studies; forced migration studies; interdisciplinary studies or other relevant graduate programs with commitments to equality and social justice  Have an ability to work both independently and as part of a team with minimal supervision  Have excellent organizational skills; high attention to detail; and ability to meet deadlines  Have strong written and verbal communication skills  Have grounded understanding in and/or connections to marginalized groups (e.g.; Black Peoples; Indigenous Peoples; Displaced Peoples; and migrants)  Be self‐motivated; goal‐oriented; and results‐driven,Womens Studies; Statistics; Social Work; Public Health; Psychology; Political Science; Native Studies; Law-International; Law; International Studies; Humanities; History; Health Studies; French Language; Development Studies; Canadian Studies; Education
32786,Investigation of CO2 electrolysis reversibility in seawater,The project will take place in the department of chemistry at St Francis Xavier University; within the group of Dr. Bertin. Recently; we have started to study the electroreduction of CO2 into seawater. Seawater has a suitable pH for CO2 reduction; and its ionic strength is sufficient to sustain moderate electrolysis current without additional salt. We have successfully demonstrated that bismuth nanoparticles prepared by PLAL can successfully operate in either seawater or the conventional bicarbonate buffer with no loss of performances. On bismuth; the product of the reduction of CO2 is formate. Formate is an environmentally benign salt; that has application in the leather industry; as deicing salt; but also has fuel in formate (or formic acid) fuel cells. Formic acid fuel cells have been widely studied in the last two decades; but to the best of our knowledge never in seawater. Yet; it would be highly interesting to determine if direct formate oxidation in seawater is possible. If it is; it could allow the CO2 electrolyzer to operate as an electrolyzer in periods of high renewable (solar; wind) electricity generation; but also as a fuel cell in times when renewable electricity sources are less productive. Formate is also a stable salt; so it could be easily stored long enough to compensate for seasonal variability of renewable energy sources as well.,ErwanBertin,Nova Scotia,St. Francis Xavier University,Either English or French,2024-05-13,To positively contribute to the project; the student should have completed courses equivalent to a 2nd year chemistry student at St Francis Xavier University; with particular emphasis on analytical chemistry and physical chemistry.

32787,Encapsulation de molécule active pour le traitement de l'ACG de type 1B,Congenital Glycosylation Anomalies (CGAs) are genetic disorders that disrupt protein glycosylation. Type 1A CAGs are caused by phosphomannomutase (PMM) deficiency; and result in moderate to severe mental retardation. In contrast; type 1B ACG; linked to mutations in the PMI1 gene; causes exudative enteropathy and hypoglycemia in infants; without neurological manifestations. Treatment of type 1B ACG currently involves daily oral mannose. However; this requires several doses a day to maintain constant serum levels; which can lead to compliance problems. In addition; variations in mannose levels can lead to long-term complications; including liver fibrosis and thrombophilia. To address these issues; it is important to develop a formulation that allows a gradual release of mannose throughout the day; mimicking its physiological release. This would help maintain stable serum mannose levels and reduce the complications associated with type 1B CAG. In this context; the project proposes to develop a juice suspension containing two forms of mannose: a rapid-release non-encapsulated form and a sustained-release encapsulated form. The use of encapsulation systems offers several advantages; not least the possibility of controlling release over time. The technical challenge lies in obtaining mannose microparticles that release the sugar in such a way as to maintain a constant concentration in the body. In conclusion; this project aims to develop a formulation that can control the release of mannose over time; thus maintaining a constant concentration in the body. Such advances could improve the quality of life of CAG patients and offer better prospects for long-term treatment.,LionelRipoll,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The candidate must have skills in chemistry and analytical chemistry,Chemistry; Engg-Chemical
32789,Creating diverse digital characters to study empathy,Empathy is the ability to share and understand the affective state of others. This ability varies depending on the people we interact with and the context in which the interaction evolves. People tend to feel more empathy towards individuals from the same ethnic group than from a different group. Two strategies have been suggested to alleviate this bias in empathy: 1) repeated and controlled exposure and 2) promoting the adoption of the point of view of others. However; these techniques were not tested together in contexts with good ecological validity. This project aims at studying and optimize empathy in ingroup-outgroup interactions by varying the visual characteristics of digital characters (MetaHumans); or contextual elements in virtual environments; to increase exposure to outgroup individuals and promote adopting the point of view of others. Method: Controlled online experiments will be conducted in the general population using a new adapted version of the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE; 1st version; Jackson et al.; 2015) called AffectiveStudio. In this platform; new realistic characters from MetaHuman Creator (Epic Games) whose characteristics related to age; gender; and ethnicity can be produced. The facial expressions of the different characters are animated by moving several features of the face independently (i.e.; Action Units). AffectiveStudio currently comprises 16 characters representing young adults (women and men) from four ethnic groups. This project will integrate new features to AffectiveStudio (e.g.; accessories; postural behaviors; older characters; other ethnic and culture groups) and a novel method to measure the users’ representation of facial expressions through an interactive mode. Implications: This project will generate new knowledge on how the ingroup versus outgroup effect affects empathy. It will contribute to developing novel tools through which empathy can be optimized and maintained as a viable solution to embrace diversity and promote equity and inclusion.,PhilipJackson,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Qualifications: - Minimum of two years in a recognized program of Computer Sciences/Engineering; Graphic Design or relevant program - Experience with 3-D animation or human-machine systems (e.g.; apps; video games) - Experience with animation tools (e.g.; Unreal/Unity) and relevant programming languages (e.g.; C# and C++) Core Skills and Abilities: - Strong interest in affective computing research and scientific programming within an academic setting - Excellent verbal and written communication skills (English or French); including the ability to work effectively with others in an interdisciplinary team Additional assets: - Experience in Python (or other languages used in data sciences and web),
32792,Knowledge Representation to Combat False Claims on Social Media Platform,This project aims at developing new techniques to detect false narratives on social media. In recent years; we have witnessed how social media can be used to influence people (e.g.; voters) with misinformation and disinformation campaigns that if amplified by AI algorithms can reach millions of people. In this research; PLM and KG will be combined to mitigate this problem. Specifically; knowledge can be implicitly encoded on PLM; such as BERT; GPT-3 and T5; using unstructured data. These models have been very successful in several NLP tasks related to semantic retrieval. Despite the strong performance attained by these models; they often struggle with examples not seen during the fine-tuning stage. Previous research has shown significant improvement with the combination of structured knowledge from KGs and the representations learned by PLMs. Although; this approach has attracted NLP researchers; it is still an open question how to integrate the KG and PLM for specific semantic related tasks. In this research; the focus will be on infodemic and disinformation campaigns during political election.,AndersonRaymundo Avila,Québec,Université INRS,English,2024-05-06,• Pursuing a degree in Computer Science; Computer Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Mathematics or equivalent • Knowledge in Python • Knowledge in machine learning theory and practice (especially deep learning) • Energetic; self-motivated and execution-oriented individuals that are passionate about producing new knowledge,Computer Science; Engg-Computer
32794,Reducing Model Complexity in Federated Learning Settings,This project aims at developing new techniques to reduce the complexity of deep neural networks in order to enable their deployment on edge devices. Tech companies around the world have been demanded to treat user data carefully and in accordance to user-privacy laws. Deep learning AI systems often require the user data to be sent to the cloud in order to be processed remotely on large data processing clusters. This raises concerns as sensitive data need to be sent over the internet. Enabling on-device computing can mitigate security and privacy concerns by keeping users' data within their devices. In this research; the aim will be to improve the efficiency of deep learning applications by exploring techniques such as model compression; knowledge distillation in order to enable powerful AI algorithms to run more efficiently on low-power mobile devices. This will allow to confine the processing of private sensitive data at the IoT device itself. Federated Learning will be explored as it enables AI models to learn from multiple decentralized edge devices using only local data; thus avoiding exchanging such data through the network.,AndersonRaymundo Avila,Québec,Université INRS,English,2024-05-06,• Pursuing a degree in Computer Science; Computer Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Mathematics or equivalent. • Knowledge in Python • Knowledge in machine learning theory and practice (especially deep learning). • Energetic; self-motivated and execution-oriented individuals that are passionate about producing new knowledge.,Computer Science; Engg-Computer
32795,Contagion in financial markets: the application of network analysis in finance,The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the connectedness of financial institutions around the world. This networking can have important consequences; both positive and negative; for global and national financial systems. In this context; network theory and social network analysis (SNA) can provide helpful tools and measures to better understand the effects of networks or any other phenomena of finance or; to quote Allen and Babus (2009): “Mapping the networks between financial institutions is a first step towards gaining a better understanding of modern financial systems.” The objective of this project is to study and analyse the topology and structure of different financial markets or networks; such as the mutual and pension funds networks; the syndicated loan market network and all the main securities markets. To do so; a comprehensive network theory approach that includes novel financial network analysis tools and metrics will offer an essential perspective on the underlying connections in the networks. Basic network structure metrics will be estimated; such as small-world statistic; scale-free parameters; etc. Further; novel network measures; which are typically developed in other fields; will be applied to the financial networks identified above: herd behavior; sources of diffusion; influential spreaders; bridges; adoption probabilities; mobility traces; etc. Because different networks can emerge from the same connections (e.g.; dual-mode network; correlation network; etc.); the metrics will be estimated for a variety of networks. The expected contributions of the project are both scientific and practical.,ClaudiaChampagne,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-20,1.

32801,RevolveRL,The project focuses on enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) through the evolution of a reward function using genetic programming (GP). RL is an artificial intelligence approach where an agent learns to achieve a specific objective; such as winning a game of Starcraft 2. The agent interacts with the environment; receiving feedback in the form of rewards after each action taken. The challenge lies in defining an effective reward function. Traditionally; researchers rely on their experience to tune this function; but it may not be optimal. The project aims to address this issue by evolving the reward function using GP. GP; a type of evolutionary computation; employs principles inspired by natural evolution to iteratively refine a population of reward functions. By evolving the reward function over time; the project aims to improve training time and enhance the overall performance of the RL agent. The evolution process will involve generating a diverse set of reward functions and evaluating their effectiveness in achieving the desired objective. Through iterative selection; crossover; and mutation; GP will refine the reward functions; favoring those that lead to better performance. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of manually designed reward functions and enable the RL agent to learn more efficiently and effectively while also removing human biases. The project offers an opportunity to explore the potential of GP in enhancing RL. By evolving the reward function; it aims to reduce training time and optimize the performance of the agent in accomplishing the specified mission. Through this research; valuable insights can be gained into the impact of reward function design on RL algorithms and the potential benefits of evolutionary approaches in this context.,Jean-Alexis Delamer,Nova Scotia,St. Francis Xavier University,Either English or French,2024-05-15,We are seeking a motivated student with a background in AI; and data analysis science for our research project.

32804,The Role of Meteorite Impacts in the Origin and Evolution of Life,This project aims to better understand how meteorite impacts events generate hydrothermal systems; which can generate unique habitats for heat-loving (thermophilic) organisms and produce secondary minerals such as clays; which form catalysts for organic reactions. A comprehensive review of the literature on all craters on Earth will be conducted to determine where in a crater hydrothermal alteration occurs; the types of mineral species produced; etc. This is part of a larger ongoing team effort to which the student will contribute to. This summer research will also study samples from the Mistastin and West Clearwater Lake impact structures; both in Canada; where hydrothermal alterations has been recognized but not studied in any detail. Thin sections of these samples will be studied using optical microscopy (for textures); electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) (for micro-textures and elemental mapping); and raman spectroscopy (for organics). The results of these investigations will enhance our understanding of how hydrothermal systems in impact craters generate and whether such systems may have provided habitats for life on Mars.,GordonOsinski,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge of geoscience; geobiology and geochemistry.

32805,A Comparative Study of Impact Melts on the Earth and Moon,Constraining the initial conditions of impact melt remain a challenge. Geothermometer systems that are commonly used in geosciences are not sufficient to constrain the temperature of impact melt since most are not able to withstand the high pressure conditions of impact cratering and none are known to exceed 1700 °C. Zirconia (ZrO2); a dissociation product of zircon; is one mineral phase that can constrain temperature in the geologic record because they exhibit diverse polymorphs across a wide range of temperatures. During the summer research; the student will study the properties of zircon in samples of impact melt from various Canadian impact craters; lunar meteorites and Apollo samples. Samples will be studied via optical microscopy (for textures); scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) (for micro-textures and large-scale elemental mapping) electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) (for micro-textures and fine-scale elemental mapping); and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) (to study the microstructure and crystallographic orientations). In addition to this; satellite images of lunar impact craters will be used to map the distribution and properties of impact melt deposits on the Moon allowing for a comparative study of samples with remote sensing data.,GordonOsinski,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge of igneous and metamorphic petrology; mineralogy and geochemistry; geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing.

32806,Legal Constructions of Religion and Nonreligion,This project examines the use of religion and nonreligion in Canada and in the other project sites (Australia; the Nordic countries [Sweden; Norway; Denmark; Finland]; the United States; the United Kingdom; and Latin America [Brazil and Argentina]); through the lens of public controversies. Examples of public controversies include sexual and reproductive rights; ‘conversion therapy’; state funding of religion in various formats (schools; tax subsidies; social service programmes); anti-discrimination and religious freedom laws; medically assisted dying; climate change and religious symbols in the public sphere. This project will allow us to understand the dynamics of social and political conflicts that organize the configuration of the public sphere in each country; and analyze the impacts of these articulations on the development of religious/moral regulations and public policies. The MITACS Globalink internship will provide an important learning opportunity for a student to participate in collaborative research between Lori Beaman (University of Ottawa); Paula Montero (University of Sao Paulo) and Juan Marco Vaggione (National University of Cordoba).,LoriBeaman,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-13,The skills and background required of a student would be experience in and enthusiasm for examining legal cases and in data collection; including using a variety of databases and local websites (each county; city and municipal region will store data in their own way). This position would enable the student to develop a range of skills; including data collection; research; writing; and organizational skills. They would also have the opportunity to strengthen their multi-tasking and time-management abilities in a highly professional workplace. Although team members will be actively engaged in supervising the student; they should be capable of working independently.,
32807,Death and Dying: Changing Policies, Practices and Laws,Religion has been an important force in shaping understandings of the meaning of death; narratives and practices around dying; and legal approaches to issues such as assisted dying. The shift from religious affiliation to nonreligion (including atheism; agnosticism; humanism; the spiritual but not religious and indifference) has potential impact on palliative care; organ donation; medically assisted dying; obituaries and funeral rituals as well as memorials (including ghost bikes); among other things. Moreover; the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed fissures around life; death; and dying. Religion has often been used to make meaning of death. How are life and death conceptualized in nonreligious ways? This series of projects aims to examine changing social practices related to these areas: Palliative care; Death cafes; Medically Assisted Dying; Obituaries/Funerals; and National narratives of dying. The MITACS Globalink internship will provide an important learning opportunity for a student to participate in collaborative research with Lori Beaman; (University of Ottawa).,LoriBeaman,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-13,The skills and background required of a student would be experience in and enthusiasm for data organization; textual; content and discourse analysis; visual arts analysis; website and blog analysis.

32808,Application of additive manufacturing for Nanomedicne production,The journey of a nanoparticle in the human body can be very complex and often unpredictable. With the increasing number of potential applications of nanoformulations in the biomedical world (in sensing; imaging; drug delivery; vaccines) it has become clear that more knowledge about their interactions with living cells is necessary in order to predict their fate after administration. In this project; we propose to study the chemical and colloidal stability of nanoparticles in biological media and in vivo. Using 3D fabrication techniques; the student will design; fabricate and utilize a micromixing device capable of producing rapidely hundreds of different nanoparticle formulations. The library of formulation will be based on chemically distinct polymers already available in the lab. Once produced; formulations will be characterized for their physical chemical properties and capacity to enter targetted cells. The student will be trained on microfab techniques and in numerous techniques widely used in the nanomedicine field. The analysis of the results will be performed under the supervision of a doctoral researcher leading this research program.,xavierBanquy,Québec,Université de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Some necessary skills and academic background necessary: Experience in experimental science (lab work).

32809,Wait! What am I inhaling?! Toxic metals analysis in soil using ICP-MS,Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) will be utilized in order to study both toxic and essential metals in a variety of soil samples. A worst case risk assessment will be conducted using the concept of bio-accessibility in order to see what fraction of metals are leached out in each subsequent body fluid (ie. Saliva; Gastric Juice and Intestinal Juice). The value of this research is it can be applied to commonly consumed foods where little to no research may have been conducted before or little to no regulations have been put in place. Arsenic (As) is a toxic metal that is commonly found in the earths surface; in pesticides and thus can be introduced into our food system either naturally or through human involvement. Soil has the ability to hold metals (both toxic and essential) for decades and thus a farm that is currently treated as organic with no added pesticides could actually have contaminants from decades past. It is up to us to find ways to optimize analysis techniques; efficiency and sample type in order to maximize results obtained and ensure safety to human health.,NausheenSadiq,Alberta,Mount Royal University,English,2024-06-03,This project will involve students to be creative in regards to sample selection and analysis strategies. In addition; an interest or experience in analytical chemistry will be a great asset. Although the study does involve biological concepts; that is not a requirement for students to have. Finally; a great deal of the work will require data analysis; processing and dissemination. Thus; there is value in having a strong comfort level with excel and strong communication skills. Whatever level you arrive with; the goal is to enhance it and send you home a stronger analytical chemist!,
32810,Catalysts for cyclic carbonate production,In this project we develop heterogenous catalyst for the reaction of epoxides with CO2 which produces cyclic carbonates. In an other project we work on the production of a variety of epoxides and diepoxides from different molecules of vegetable origin. The cyclic carbonates generated out of these materials are potentially monomers for different polymers including polycarbonates and polyurethanes. The outcome of this project will therefore be a series of new polymers entirely generated out of biomass and CO2.,SergeKaliaguine,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-06,The student should be working toward a BSc in Chemical Engineering; in Chemistry or the equivalent.,
32811,Polymers for biomedical applications,The project involves the synthesis and characterization of a wide range of custom made polymers mainly for applications in the biomedical fields. More specifically; we are interested in the development of new materials for (1) therapeutics nano-delivery systems; (2) for tissue engineering and (3) for cryopreservation of cells. Experience in chemistry; chemical engineering; polymer science and engineering or biomaterials is an asset.,RavinNarain,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Some background on organic; polymer or biochemistry will be useful.,
32812,Biochemical investigations of the delivery system for improving safety and efficacy of therapeutic RNA delivery,RNA-based drugs represent a paradigm shift in the treatment and prevention of critical diseases of global significance like viral infections and cancer. A major hurdle in RNA therapy is drug delivery to the correct intracellular location; which requires a delivery system. Cationic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the most clinically advanced delivery system. Despite recent success; a major impediment for the usage of lipid-based delivery systems for RNA delivery is their safety; e.g.; COVID-19 mRNA-LNP vaccines are associated with systemic side effects like inflammation and myocarditis. Gaps in our understanding of causes and mechanisms of this undesired inflammation and immune activation calls for new fundamental insights to guide rational NP-design. The intracellular sensing of RNA by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is well understood. However; the innate sensing of the RNA delivery system by the immune cells is poorly understood. We hypothesize that cellular sensing of RNA delivery systems by PRRs is dependent on the specific molecular features of the lipid molecules (e.g.; chain length; saturation); which can be modulated by controlling the packing of lipid molecules within the NP structure. We will formulate nanoparticles with different lipid packing arrangements and evaluate their nanostructure and innate immune activation.,AneeshThakur,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,1.

32813,Biopolymer-Graphene Oxide Hydrogel Beads for Removal of Legacy and Emerging Contaminants from Water,In this project; we will use graphene oxide (GO); a novel carbon-based 2D nanomaterial for developing 3D porous macrostructures such as sponges and beads for removal of various contaminants from water. Our lab is a pioneer in developing high performance GO-based filters for removal of a suite of legacy (dyes; heavy metals and bacteria) and emerging contaminants (hormones; pharmaceuticals and microplastics) from water. Our goal is to develop a point-of-use (POU) modular device to remove a multitude of legacy and emerging contaminants from water. Our strategy is to develop porous biopolymer beads (such as alginate and chitosan) reinforced with GO and other nanomaterials; and to pack them in glass columns to develop flow-through modules for treatment of complex matrix waters containing multiple contaminants. The science behind the processing of the nanocomposite beads has been developed by two of my graduate students in the past 2 years; and the undergraduate trainee will focus on developing the flow-though water treatment device and conducting water treatment tests. The modular POU devices will be especially useful for remote areas where access to centralized water treatment facilities are limited; such as Canadian Northern communities; as well as the various communities in the Global South.,NarimanYousefi,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-01,1.

32814,Mathematics of Scientific Machine Learning,The overarching aim of the wider research programme is to develop machine-learning methods for coarse-graining physical laws; for example the laws of interaction between atoms and electrons. Mathematically speaking; this work builds on numerical analysis; approximation theory; inverse problems; statistics and representation theory; as opposed to traditional "ad hoc" modelling. A paradigm example are interatomic potentials and force fields: while traditionally thought of as ad hoc mechanistic models; there is now a major push towards a new generation based on machine-learning methodology with the aim to match them to high fidelity quantum chemistry models to within very high precision. The underlying electronic structure is "coarse-grained" leaving only mechanical response to describe. The general ideas and much of the fundamental methodology apply to a wide range of scenarios. Other topics of current interest include: solving the electronic Schrödinger equation; learning coarse-grained electronic structure models; or coarse-grained dynamical systems. This project will focus on theoretical understanding of ML methods in this general context. The work can be either purely analytical; purely algorithmic or anything in-between. The concrete direction can be decided with the student. Possible directions include but are not limited to: - Develop robust uncertainties: If a computed property comes with an error estimate (uncertainty) attached then this can provide confidence in a simulation. During model development; such error estimates can be used to improve the representation; training set generation or for model refinement. - Universality (completeness) of ML architectures: Which parameters must be converged? Can we provide rates of convergence? - Analysis of extrapolation capabilities: in scientific ML; predictions must often be made on inputs that are very different from the training dataset. We try to explain why this is usually not genuine extrapolation (i.e.; not "out-of-distribution").,ChristophOrtner,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,BACKGROUND: The student will have a strong background in one of - computational statistics; baysian statistics; uncertainty quantification - numerical analysis; scientific computing; inverse problems - machine-learning MOTIVATION: The student should be motivated - to contribute to interdisciplinary research project and be open to engage in cross-disciplinary collaborations. - and have the confidence to drive the direction of the research (with help and close guidance by the advisor) CODE DEVELOPMENT: - Some programming experience is essential. The advisor and research group will help the student in contributing to our existing code base if and as needed.,Mathematics; Statistics; Computer Science
32815,Machine Learning Force Fields for The Dark Matter of the Protein Universe,Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) for molecular dynamics simulation promise quantum chemistry accuracy at vastly reduced computational cost. This has the potential to revolutionize biochemical research and discovery; including for example rational drug design and synthetic biology. The main barrier to fulfilling this promise is the limit in time-scale that can be reached with the approaches available for the foreseeable future. To overcome this; we propose to exploit MLFF model hierarchies to develop parallel-in-time simulation algorithms that will be capable of accelerating the sampling of non-equilibrium trajectories by a factor 10-100. This will enable ab initio accuracy molecular dynamics simulation on biological time-scales. Our long term aim is the simulation of biological systems with ab initio accuracy on biological time-scales. The application of particular interest to our collaboration is the computational modelling of intrinsically disordered proteins; and their contributions to cellular regulations. A reliable and efficient “virtual laboratory” to study these proteins has the potential to create step-changes in rational drug design and synthetic biology. The first ingredient we require is a highly accurate machine-learned force field (MLFF). The computational cost of such MLFFs will prevent us from reaching biological timescales in the foreseeable future; and we require new methods to accelerate time-integration. Specifically; we propose to develop a "coarse-grained" MLFF that is capable of much faster but less accurate exploration of dynamical properties; which can subsequently be refined using a high-accuracy force-field.,ChristophOrtner,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,The ideal student will fall within one of two categories: either (1) with a strong computational mathematics background (e.g.;numerical analysis; scientific computing; machine learning; computational statistics; statistical mechanics) with some exposure and a strong motivation to get involved in modelling of complex physical processes. or (2) have a background in a quantitative science (e.g. physics; bio-physics; bio-chemistry; ...); with focus on theory; modelling and computational aspects. Either student must be ready to work with collaborators from other disciplines. A strong background in either Python or Julia is desirable.,
32816,Derive Stress-Strain Curves of GTA Soils from Soil Physical Indices,This research will characterize the stress-strain curve of glacial deposits obtained during the pressuremeter test (PMT) and derive it from basic soil parameters. The overburden soils covering the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are deposits formed mainly through glacial actions with the characteristics of highly variable material properties and complex non-linear stress-strain characteristics (Baker et al.; 1998). Among many testing methods; the PMT has become one of the most reliable in-situ testing techniques for glacial deposits. The basic idea of PMT is to conduct a cavity expansion experiment inside the soil and derive the soil parameters from the stress-strain curve during the expansion of the probe. The PMT has been used to derive various geotechnical parameters for the design of foundations and underground structures (Baguelin et al.; 1978; Briaud; 2013). Recently; a total of over 400 PMT tests were collected from a local transit project in Toronto; which provides an excellent opportunity to characterize the geotechnical properties of local soils. Evaluation and interpretation of geotechnical data is still a great challenge though it is crucial for any safe and economic infrastructure development. A high level of risk is built into many projects because of limited geotechnical investigation program due to budget and schedule restraints. This research is to study the characteristics of stress-strain curves of local soils and derive the stress-strain curves from basic tests without incurring expensive and time-consuming field tests; such as PMT. Research findings will be extremely valuable to the local geotechnical community and applicable for any infrastructure development in the GTA and Canada.,JinyuanLiu,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-16,The ideal candidate should be a civil engineering undergraduate who has finished their second-year studies with related courses like statistics; probability; and soil mechanics.,Engg-Civil
32817,Systematically Review of Statistical Learning Methods for Big Data,In this project; we target to build a complete guideline of the current methods and recommendations for their use for different data. The summer internship student will help to explore various methods; including regression models; tree-based methods; Random Forest; and SVM; etc.; and apply these methods to the benchmark data. Through validation studies; we will systematically evaluate and compare approaches based on comprehensive evaluation metrics and develop guidelines on using the methods with specific recommendations for big data.,LiXing,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,The basic requirements for the project are four-fold: (1) have basic statistical knowledge; including probability and likelihood inference; (2) have experience in data management and analysis; (3) know how to use regression models; and (4) have working knowledge in R or Python. Priority will be given to students who have taken machine learning courses or have research experience with machine learning.,
32818,Metabolic reprogramming in sarcoma,Cancer cells rewire metabolic pathways and energy production to support the enhanced proliferation; invasion and resistance to treatment. The three main glucose metabolism pathways that support growth of cancer cells are: a) the glycolysis pathway for energy production; b) the pentose phosphate pathway for biomass production; and c) the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) for protein glycosylation. Activation of HBP leads to altered glycosylation of oncogenes; transcription factors and kinases in many types of cancer. These aberrations contribute to increased proliferation and survival of tumor cells; and are associated with resistance to treatment. In this project; we study metabolic reprogramming through HBP in two types of sarcoma: leiomyosarcoma and desmoid tumors. Our study will explore the potential of therapeutic targeting of HBP and the functional consequences of the activation of HBP in sarcoma.,JoannaPrzybyl,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-06-03,Experience in molecular biology techniques (e.g.; extraction of nucleic acids; polymerase chain reaction); histology; mass spectrometry; and/or cell culture experiments.

32819,Ensemble Learning for Biomarker Identification,Machine learning methods generally focus on prediction and ignore the association between predictors and outcome variables. For this summer project; I propose to build ensemble models that target accurate prediction and the ability to identify significant associations. This method is an extension of our current development on the bless algorithm. Students will be able to learn how to design ensemble models and evaluate their performance in these two aspects.,LiXing,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,The basic requirements for the project are four-fold: (1) have basic statistical knowledge; including probability and likelihood inference; (2) have experience in data management and analysis; (3) know how to use regression models; and (4) have working knowledge in R or Python.

32820,Machine Learning for Survival Outcome,This project will be focused on the use of machine learning for survival data. Survival outcome records the time until an event of interest occurs; such as diagnosing a disease or mortality. Censoring is a common feature in which the time to the event cannot be completely observed. Traditional statistical methods for survival outcomes include the Cox model based on the proportional hazard (PH) and the Accelerated Failure Time model (AFT). Regularized Cox models (Lasso Cox; Elastic Net Cox) and ensemble learning (CoxBoost algorithm; Bagging Survival Trees and Random Survival Forest) are recently developed methods for high-dimensional data. We will apply those models to the real world large data with survival outcomes; compare model performance; and make reasonable interpretations.,LiXing,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,The basic requirements for the project are four-fold: (1) have basic statistical knowledge; including probability and likelihood inference; (2) have experience in data management and analysis; (3) know how to use regression models; and (4) have working knowledge in R or Python.

32821,Developing clinical practice guidelines relating to cognitive assessment in stroke and traumatic brain injury,This research project aims to develop a best practice guideline for occupational therapists providing services to individuals post-stroke and brain injury. Currently; a few general best-practice guidelines are available; but none of them are specified for occupational therapies. Different assessment approaches and interventions should be provided depending on the disease stage; the disease severity; and the unit in which occupational therapists are providing their services to this population. Therefore; developing a best practice guideline for occupational therapists; whose role is to improve the level of independence of their clients; will fill this gap and support them in their decision-making. This project will consist of an extensive literature review for phase one and then conducting interviews with senior occupational therapists and educators in phase two. Finally; the information from the two phases will be combined to guide us in developing the best-practice guideline. Prospective students will engage in phase one of the study for most of their training; and if time allows they will be engaged in activities related to phase two of the study.,SorayyaAskari,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-17,The successful candidate will have the following skills: 1- attention to detail 2- strong organizational skills 3- having experience with literature search and literature review is an asset 4- strong writing skill 5- good communication skills and fluent in English 6- having background information about neurological conditions is an asset,
32822,Global Studies of Healthy Development and Wellbeing of Children and Youth, Stage Nine,Our research has five inter-related international human developmental foci. First; we examine cross-culturally; context and culture in Moral Development of children and youths' verbal deception and truth telling (Cameron; et al.; 2022). We have gathered data from youth in China and Canada]; and are now investigating the development of Truth and Trust in Canadian and Chinese children and Integrity in Western children. We have successfully completed Year 2 of a three-year cross-lag longitudinal study of the integrity of young children (Gill et al.; 2022). This summer we are launching Year 3. Our second research programme employs quasi-ecological methods for studying Thriving across the lifespan and around the globe. We have collected data in Thailand; Canada; Italy; the UK; Peru; Turkey; and USA with toddlers and their families; filming a "Day in their Lives" (Gillen & Cameron; 2015; Cameron & Stella; 2022) and resilient mobile adolescents in China; Thailand; South Africa; India; and Canada (Cameron; et al.; 2014). As well; we are filming "Days in the Lives" of preschool children in transition to school in Italy; Canada and Brazil (Cameron; et al.;2022); and older adults in Canada; Brazil and Switzerland; Cameron et al.; 2022). This is ‘cultural’ rather than ‘cross-cultural’ research: it seeks not to make generalizations from quantitative findings; but rather to understand the nature of wellbeing through in-depth qualitative analyses of individual cases; to create vivid pictures of thriving in varying contexts and cultures. This year; we have documented a "Day in the Life" of one Canadian toddler boy and one kindergarten girl. And we have just published a paper on psychosocial factors affecting adolescents’ adjustment in transition to university (Cameron et al.; 2023). Finally; we are examining gendered expectations of adolescent girls’ close female Friendships and boys’ intimate dating Relationships (Cameron; Luft; et al.; 2017; 2022; 2023).,Catherine AnnCameron,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Micas internships undergraduate students who have most successfully served in our lab if they have focussed their studies to courses and research in psychology and who have a plan to complete an honours degree in psychology because they intend to proceed to graduate studies in psychology.

32823,Effet du changement climatique sur la dynamique du crabe des neiges dans le sud du golfe du Saint-Laurant,La pêche au crabe des neiges dans le sud du golfe du Saint-Laurent est un atout économique important pour le Nouveau-Brunswick. La mise en place de règles de décision; visant à maintenir un taux d'exploitation optimal du stock de crabes; est cruciale pour une gestion durable de cette pêche. Afin de prendre des décisions éclairées; le développement d'outils d'aide à la décision fiables; basés sur des modèles mathématiques; est d’une importance capitale. Plusieurs aspects ont un impact sur la dynamique du crabe des neiges dont la mort naturelle et l’exploitation humaine. Cependant; un des facteurs le plus inquiétant est le réchauffement des eaux de mer dû au changement climatique. Le crabe des neiges est une espèce très sensible aux variations de température et un réchauffement de l'eau pourrait avoir un effet néfaste sur sa distribution spatiale; sa croissance; sa reproduction et ses relations trophiques. Ce réchauffement peut également entraîner l’apparition de prédateurs; la présence d'espèces exotiques envahissantes ainsi que l'introduction de maladies et de parasites représentant un risque à la santé et à la dynamique du crabe des neiges. Le but de ce projet; en partenariat avec le ministère des Pêches et des Océans (MPO); est d’étudier l’impact du réchauffement des eaux du golfe du Saint-Laurent sur la dynamique de la population des crabes. Je développerai un modèle; basé sur des techniques mathématiques et statistiques; qui tiendra compte de l’effet climatique. Ce modèle permettra une estimation de l'état actuel du stock du crabe des neiges; et une prédiction du stock futur (à moyen et long terme). Il fournira ainsi des descriptions qualitatives et quantitatives de cette pêche; dotera le MPO des avis et renseignements scientifiques de qualité; et permettra une prise de décision rigoureuse et fiable dans la gestion de cette pêche.,IbrahimaDione,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,French,2024-05-01,L'étudiante et l'étudiant intéressé(e) doivent avoir des connaissances aux: 1) équations différentielles; 2) notions de modélisation; 3) notions d'analyse numérique de base.,Mathematics
32824,Determining environmental determinants of multidrug resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii,In this project; we plan to study the role of temperature in the multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii. Cells will be grown at incubation temperatures of 15 deg C and 37 deg C. RNA will be isolated and the expression of efflux pumps determined using qPCR. RNA-Sequencing will be carried out to determine the global impact of low incubation temperature on A. baumannii. Virulence of cells grown at different temperatures will be analyzed using the worm infection model. Preliminary data from our laboratory shows that perturbations in fatty acid synthesis impacts multidrug resistance of A. baumannii via the expression of efflux pumps. Also since low incubation temperature affects the membrane lipid profile; we are interested in learning if altered lipid profile of the cells grown under low incubation temperature affects the multidrug resistance of A. baumannii. This project will help understand the environmental triggers of multidrug resistance in A. baumannii. The findings from this work will inform efforts to design therapeutic options that target multidrug resistance in A. baumannii.,AyushKumar,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-06,Basic microbiology skills (aseptic techniques; pipetting; plating etc) Basic knowledge of DNA; RNA extraction Background in molecular biology,Microbiology
32825,KL divergence in new Physics,The detection of small deviations from usual quantum behavior is a common feature of various theories motivated by either quantum measurement or Planck scale corrections. The detection of such corrections is difficult as they are very small. So; even though it is essential to have some universal criteria to know which system is most suitable for a certain deviation; so such universal criteria has been ever proposed. Thus; we for the first time propose a method motivated from statistics to measure measure which system is better suited to measure such small deviations from the usual quantum behavior. We will use the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the modified and original probability distributions to know the distance between them. Even though the Kullback–Leibler divergence is not a statistical distance; it can provide important information about the seperation between two distributions. We thus propose that it would be easier to measure deviations from quantum mechanics for a system if it has a higher Kullback–Leibler divergence.,XiaopingShi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Wave functions for a system in Physics Kullback–Leibler divergence in Statistics Matlab/R/Python software Latex,
32826,Inference based on Data depth,High-dimensional data are encountered in many applications of statistics and most prominently in biological studies. A specific large dimension; small sample size situation arises when testing whether two sample sets are from the same distribution; motivated by identifying significant genes in genetic sequence studies. Consider two samples that come from two distributions; F and G; respectively. We consider testing the following hypothesis: F=G. Existing hypothesis testing methods based on the rank of one-dimensional samples for data; is not appropriate under the high-dimensional situation because it lacks a natural ranking. The concept of statistical depth allows us to generalize the ranking of data into multi-dimensional space. We will consider data depth-based methods for the homogeneity test.,XiaopingShi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Two sample comparison High-dimensional data analysis Matlab/R/Python software Latex,
32827,Relevance analysis in high-dimensional samples,For the task of relevance analysis; the conventional Tukey's test may be applied to the set of all pairwise comparisons. However; there were few studies that discuss both nonparametric k-sample comparisons and relevance analysis in high dimensions. Our aim is to capture the degree of relevance between combined samples and provide additional insights and advantages in high-dimensional k-sample comparisons. Our solution is to extend a graph-based two-sample comparison and investigate its availability for large and unequal sample sizes. We will consider some graph methods such as minimum spanning tree (MST); shortest Hamiltonian path (SHP); and maximal matching (MM). MST and SHP have been applied to sample comparison and change point detection. However; MM is very new and compelling in some cases. We will compare their performance.,XiaopingShi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Graph theory Two sample comparison High-dimensional data analysis Matlab/R/Python software Latex,

32829,Approche Thermodynamique concernant la Réduction de la Consommation d'Énergie des Systèmes d'Air Comprimé et Amélioration de leur Performance.,Most factories cannot do without electricity; water; natural gas; and of course compressed air. This compressed air is used for multiple applications such as pneumatic systems; refrigeration systems; heat pumps; and cleaning systems. The air is compressed using a compressor usually driven by an electric motor. Motor power varies from a few horsepower (Ch) to more than 10;000 Ch and its energy consumption is among the highest in electrical equipment. It is estimated that nearly 50% of the electrical energy consumed by compressors could be saved simply by respecting the rules of installation and maintenance of equipment. The annual cost of running compressors often exceeds their acquisition cost. For example; in a market where the electricity rate is $0.085/kWh; it costs $52;820 annually to run a 125 HP (93.21 kWmec) compressor powered by a motor for 6;000 hours. electricity with an efficiency of 90% (equivalent to 103.57 kWel). The objective of this research project is to study; from an energy and exergy point of view; the options for reducing the energy consumption of compressors in order to improve their performance in a practical environment. For the evaluation of the costs of compressed air systems and the potential for savings; the topics that will be covered in this research project are: - Sealing of air leaks in compressed air lines. - Use of efficient motors. - Admission of fresh outside air to the compressors. - Reduced compressed air pressure. - Heat recovery for heating.,MohammedKhennich,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-03,The skills sought in the student: ▪ A good academic record. ▪ A good knowledge of Thermodynamics; Energy conversion; Thermal machines; Renewable energy systems; Heat transfer; and refrigeration systems. ▪ Engineering software: EES (Engineering Equation Solver); increased training will be given for this important engineering software for the project; Matlab; TRNSYS; (CFDs if possible) ▪ The ability to write high-quality scientific articles (newspaper articles); and one or two publications (newspaper; conferences; symposia; etc.) will be an asset.,
32830,Modelling the Early Evolution of Dense Star Clusters,Young dense star clusters are found throughout our Galaxy; and are a common mode of star formation. Studies estimate that between 50% and 100% of all stars were formed in such systems; including our own Sun. The transition between a star-free cloud of molecular gas to a gas-free star cluster; however; is poorly understood. We know that many dense clusters must disperse early in their life; as we only see a handful of massive dense clusters at older ages but a plethora of young systems. A recent survey of nearby star-forming clusters has recently created a complete stellar census down to stars much less massive than our Sun; including stellar positions; masses; and ages; as well as information about the nearby gas from which these stars have formed. It is clear from these data that our assumptions about the initial conditions for star cluster models are entirely too simplistic. Unlike most models; real clusters are not spherical; isolated; gas-free systems. Instead; they are elongated; clumpy; located in groups or along filaments of the molecular cloud; and start with a significant fraction of their mass in gas instead of stars. We would like to understand how these complex and messy systems evolve to populate the field of the galaxy with individual stars; or to form the mass old star clusters that also populate the galaxy. Using computer simulations; we model both the stellar and gaseous components of these systems; and their host galaxy environment; to elucidate and confirm their evolutionary histories.,AlisonSills,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,Undergraduate courses in physics and mathematics: classical mechanics; thermodynamics; differential equations; linear algebra; statistics at the 3rd year undergraduate level.

32832,Innovation in community health literacy by Brazilian nurses' practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,The project is an educational evaluation research after the delivery of a course implemented in January 2020 in 3 Brazilian federal universities with 63 participants. The project's first objective is to document the social impacts of the knowledge gained from a professional development course for nurses on individual health literacy (IHL) and community health literacy (CHL); which could influence changes; innovations and accomplishments in practice during the pandemic. The second objective is to respond to the following research questions: (a) Which experiences indicate that the course influenced the attitudes and practices of nurses?; (b) Which actions/projects on IHL/CHL indicate innovation and creativity in the practice of nurses?; (c) How has the implementation of IHL/CHL projects been successful and/or unsuccessful; and which are in the process of consolidation and/or are likely to happen? The project design is inspired by the theoretical perspective of Appreciate Inquiry (AI); which assembles methodological principles of action research; organizational learning and organizational change. AI focuses on a collective vision and action to generate knowledge or ideas within social systems and promote the use of knowledge and dialogue to achieve congruence between values and practices. AI unfolds with the 4D cycle: Discovery; Dream; Design; and Destiny ; (a) Discovery: appreciating the best of what is; (b) Dream: imagining what might be; (c) Design: co-constructing the ideal condition; and (d) Destiny: sustaining of life is acknowledged to empower; learn or improvise. AI can posit the inquiry in a strength-based perspective by “holding myriad potential benefits for individuals; communities; and macro systems to build resilience and promote growth during and after COVID-19".,MargarethZanchetta,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-07-30,The student should be a Brazilian senior undergraduate nursing student with a record of a successful clinical placement in the area of community health nursing; primary health care and/or nursing/health services management mostly developed in the health facilities belonging to the National Unified Health System (SUS).

32834,Exploring non-genetic sources of phenotypic heterogeneity,Genetically identical cells grown in the same environment often differ in their cellular morphology; growth characteristics; behavior; and fate. This phenomenon is known as phenotypic heterogeneity; and it can be an advantageous or an undesirable feature of biological systems. It can; for example; help cell populations adapt to new and varying external conditions or; on the other hand; lead to development of resistance to drug treatment. Numerous mechanisms can give rise to heterogeneity; however; the influence of different combinations of non-genetic factors on phenotype development in genetically identical individuals remains largely unexplored. Our key objective is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of phenotypic heterogeneity; and of the interplay between genotype; the environment; and cell physiology in shaping a cell's behaviour. High-content screening (HCS); that combines high-throughput microscopy with quantitative multi-parametric image analysis; provides rich information about the properties of biological systems at the single cell level; and is thus ideally suited to study phenotypic heterogeneity. We have used HCS to image subcellular phenotype and cell state markers for > 25 million cells from a large number of mutant budding yeast strains grown in different environments. With machine learning-based image analysis we are extracting phenoptype and cell state information for each single cell; and penetrance information (fraction of abnormal looking cells) for each imaged cell population. The proposed research project aims to: a) mine this dataset and explore phenotype dependence on genotype; environment and cell state; b) use the extracted information to formulate and test hypotheses on the role of non-genetic sources in phenotypic heterogeneity.,MojcaMattiazzi Usaj,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,Solid understanding of undergraduate level genetics; cell biology; molecular biology is a must.

32835,Cognitive Cloud-edge Continuum Orchestration System,The evergrowing resource requirements of modern-day applications concerning guaranteed low latency and the massive data transfer rate constantly push the boundaries of technologies and require a paradigm shift. To cater to these escalating resource needs; modern IT computing platforms have evolved beyond the more traditional central cloud with bleeding edge processing powers and high-capacity networking infrastructure to extend their coverage to the network edge. This creates a new paradigm called cloud edge computing continuum (CECC); whereby the services span from core cloud to edge. The services that require a high data rate or low latency should be shifted toward the edge closer to end users and data producers (sensors; smartphones; etc.). To efficiently manage and continuously optimize resources through this new model using the CECC approach; we propose a cognitive cloud edge continuum orchestration system (C3OS). This framework will play a critical role in providing scalability; agility; effectiveness; and dynamicity in service delivery over the CECC infrastructure. C3OS will offer a common federated platform that manages data sources; CECC resources; and application behavior in a unified and harmonized manner to ensure the desired service level agreement (SLA). C3OS will leverage artificial intelligence (AI); machine learning; and mathematical optimization techniques to provide an efficient life cycle management system of services and CECC resources for ensuring low response time and high data rate. This project will empower C3OS with sufficient proactive mechanisms; tools; and Algorithms for orchestrating CECC resources (computation; memory; storage; and networking) in an efficient and timely manner to meet the desired SLA with the lowest cost.,miloudbagaa,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-08,The students should have a strong background in software coding.

32836,Defining and targeting drug toxicity pathways in vitro,Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic widely used to treat solid tumours in children. Unfortunately; over half of treated children develop treatment-related toxicities. Ototoxicity is a frequent adverse drug reaction to cisplatin treatment that causes permanent hearing loss in both ears. This can have a significant impact on speech and language development in children; as well as a prolonged socio-economic impact. This research project will study cisplatin toxicity using in vitro models. Cellular responses to cisplatin treatment will be characterized in cultured ear cell lines. These responses will be used as reporters of cisplatin-signaling. Drug-gene interactions; e.g. transcriptomic changes induced by cisplatin treatment; will be used to identify genes and pathways required for cisplatin signaling that may contribute to the development of ototoxicity. Signaling components identified through these analyses will be validated by gene silencing and tested in the cisplatin response assays characterized above. Genes critical to cisplatin signaling will be examined as candidates for the development of protectant therapies that prevent the development of ototoxicity. Existing small molecules targeting these candidate genes will be leveraged in this regard. Otoprotective agents are in demand given the high rates of ototoxicity in cisplatin-treated patients but currently none are approved for clinical use. Otoprotectants identified through this research project would be fit for preclinical animal studies of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and would serve as a proof-of-principle for this research program.,AmitBhavsar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-06-03,The student should have a background in biological sciences and be familiar with molecular biology and biochemical concepts. Experience with tissue culture and cell-based assays would be an asset. The student must be able to effectively communicate and must be well-organized. The student should be comfortable with; and have the ability to; work largely independently after initial training. A high degree of critical thinking skills is expected.,
32837,Analyzing the effect of insecure Single-Sign-On Delegation on Users,Delegation of services and/or operations is a common Internet practice. Examples include the delegation of user authentication (e.g.; Single-Sign-On; SSO); delegation of server authentication (e.g.; using Certificate Authorities; CAs); zone delegation in Domain Name System (DNS); and delegation of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). Our research group is currently analyzing the security of various delegation mechanisms over the Internet. SSO is one example; where a content provider (Relying Party; RP) delegates authentication procedures to an Identity Provider (IDp). Simultaneously; users delegate an IDp to endorse them and their identities to the RP. Analogous to other Internet-based delegation practices; SSO suffers from multiple security weaknesses; including the lack of formal user-delegation to the IDp; and the lack of proper communication of RP-to-IDp delegation intent. This results in an IDp's ability to impersonate users to the RP; and an RP's ability to phish a user's IDp credentials. In this specific project; we will analyze users' mental models of such delegation process; and their awareness of security risks; such as an IDps' ability to impersonate users to RPs and RPs' ability to phish users' IDp credentials. These findings will inform further projects to improve the security of SSO and ultimately other delegation practices over the Internet.,AbdelRahmanAbdou,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,Programming skills; data analysis; some basic stats; and networking knowledge.,Computer Science
32838,'Cannamoms': exploring social media descriptions of cannabis use among mothers,Mommy wine culture; or the acceptance and celebration of using alcohol to cope with parenting struggles; exploded on social media in the early 2010’s. More recently; a similar movement to gain acceptance for cannabis use among mothers seems to be gaining traction with bloggers titled; ‘Marijuana Mommy’; ‘Weed Mama’; and ‘Cannamoms’. We seek to explore the content of these blogs and social media posts from similar groups to understand 1) how is cannabis use framed? And 2) how is motherhood represented? The urgency of this exploration in a Canadian context was recently enhanced through legalization of cannabis in 2018; followed by legalization of edibles in 2019. The Mitacs Globalink student will develop a search strategy to identify social media content for inclusion and begin preliminary qualitative; thematic content analysis.

32839,Learning Discrete Dynamical Systems,A discrete dynamical system is a graph in which each node can assume a value in a pre-defined range of values. In a series of discrete time steps; the value of each node changes; how it changes is determined by a function that considers as input the value of all neighbouring nodes. In other words; the values of the nodes in the neighbourhood of node v determine the next value of node v. In this project; we will assume that a learning algorithm observes partial information on the changes of the values of (some of the) nodes in the graph. The goal of the learning algorithm is to fully determine the discrete dynamical system based on such information. In particular; we are interested in finding efficient learning algorithms for reaching this goal. Applications of this research include social network analysis (e.g.; analysis of the spread of disinformation or misinformation in a social network).,SandraZilles,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,Familiarity with basic concepts of graph theory; possibly also boolean functions.

32842,Predictors of Alcohol Consequences in Transgender Adults,This study will use a mixed methods design in order to refine and test a clinically-informative model to explain alcohol use and harms experienced by transgender people. Specifically; we will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA); involving completing brief surveys on their phones in their day-to-day lives; with 100 transgender adults who drink. The surveys will ask questions about experiences leading up to times that they drink (such as victimization; discrimination); experiences while they drink (such as mood and drug effects); and experiences after they drink (such as harms; like a hangover; missing work; having a fight). At the conclusion of their participation; qualitative interviews will be used to further contextualize the provided EMA responses. Using the quantitative and qualitative data; we will consider how some factors may increase risk for drinking and harms (like stress related to being a minority in society) and protect transgender individuals from drinking when experiencing minority stress (such as social and community support). These findings will improve our understanding of the health risks and contributors of alcohol use among transgender adults; which can help us develop gender-inclusive public health policies and interventions to prevent alcohol-related harms.,SarahDermody,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-01,Ideal candidates will have taken psychology courses as part of a psychology minor or major; and have successfully completed their program's required research methods/statistics course(s).

32843,Super-resolution Imaging in High Dimensions,Given a pixelized and blurry image taken by an optical device; such as a telescope or a microscope; super-resolution imaging aims to deblur the image and increase the resolution. Every imaging device has a corresponding point-spread function; which convolves the true image when the image is observed through the imaging device. We will assume that the point-spread function is known. This project is concerned with proposing an optimization program whose optimum solves the super-resolution imaging problem. More precisely; we will propose an optimization program; and we will show that its optimum is the true image provided that the true image is sparse. This problem has been solved in the case when the point-spread function factorizes into a product of functions; one for each dimension. Our aim will be to extend this theory; and; first; solve the problem when there exists an orthogonal transformation such that the point-spread function factorizes after the transformation is applied to its coordinates. This will generalize many known point-spread functions. If successful; we will aim to extend our theory to a larger family of point-spread functions.,ElinaRobeva,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-27,This is a theoretical mathematics project; which will require mainly strong mathematical maturity as well as expertise in linear algebra and analysis. In addition; it may be necessary to test our theory computationally; therefore; familiarity with a programming language such as Python; Julia; or R will be useful.,
32844,Enhancing Transparent Machine Learning Predictive Models through an Automated Feature Engineering Module,The use of data-driven models in decision-making is increasing due to advancements in data collection and machine learning; particularly deep learning. However; these models cannot explain their decisions; posing challenges to ensuring their trustworthiness in decision-making processes. One approach to address this issue is using transparent machine learning models; which offer explainable predictions. The problem with transparent models is that their predictive accuracy is usually lower than deep learning models. This can make them less attractive for data-driven systems; where high accuracy is often a top priority. One way to improve the predictive performance of transparent models is to include a feature engineering module that can craft features to build models with high accuracy and interpretability. However; this process requires domain knowledge and may not always be included in the design of transparent models. Therefore; there is a need to investigate new methods for automatically generating optimal feature sets. In this Globalink Research project; the intern will support the development of an automatic feature engineering module using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to derive an optimal feature set to build transparent machine learning. Specifically; the intern will work on the following specific objective: O1. Develop an automatic feature engineering module using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to derive an optimal feature set for performing supervised machine learning. This module can be a preprocessing step for interpretable machine learning (e.g.; logistic regression; decision trees; and fuzzy modeling) to improve their predictive performance. The intern will help to implement comparison scenarios to test the feature engineering module with various transparent machine-learning models applied to different data sets Building more explainable models is beneficial because we are subject to data-driven models that affect our lives; such as in loan applications.,CamiloValderrama Cuadros,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-06-03,Python Machine learning Analytical skills,
32845,Common Ground: Connecting Communities & Politics,Political communities are fracturing in today’s “culture wars”. Progressives and conservatives are worlds apart in their politics. They support different political parties; gather in different corners of the internet; receive political news from different sources; and live increasingly separate personal lives. These divisions are even affecting public health; as people on the left and right disagree over mask-wearing and global warming. In short; the political common ground appears to be shrinking in Western societies. What about Canada? Led by political scientist Jared Wesley; a group of researchers from the University of Alberta is treating Western Canadian provinces as case studies in an intriguing new approach to studying the culture war. Instead of poring over survey results – which routinely fail to register the sort of group dynamics seen in places like the US and UK – Wesley and his team are meeting face-to-face with Canadians in over a dozen communities. Through innovative ethnographic activities; the researchers are learning what unites and divides our communities. Since 2019; the Common Ground initiative has engaged with over 3000 Canadians through a series of surveys; focus groups; and coffeehouse meetings. While hard to see in social media echo-chambers; politicians’ rhetoric; or news stories that emphasize extremism; conflict; and division; their findings reveal Western Canadians share a lot of common ground within their provinces and with the rest of Canada. Departing from the conventional view; their research shows that Western Canadian political culture is only moderately conservative when it comes to the role of government in society; the economy; and the environment.,JaredWesley,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Our team is seeking social science students with an interest and background in the study of populism and conservatism in Western democracies. Skills and experience in empirical research design; ethnography; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; and/or focus group facilitation are assets.

So; too; are students with a knowledge of the rise of resentment between conservatives and progressives in other countries.,Political Science
32846,Modeling the impact of cristae on diffusion inside mitochondria,This project aims to understand how cristae structures inside mitochondria impact diffusion in distinct regions of the mitochondrial interior. This work will describe the degree to which the ATP synthesis inside cristae structures is independent of other cristae and how cristae can affect diffusion along the mitochondrial axis. Mitochondria have two membranes; one inside the other; known as the outer membrane and inner membrane. While the outer membrane is approximately bean- or tube-shaped; the inner membrane folds into tubular structures that project into the centre of the mitochondria; known as cristae. This project develop simulations and calculations to explore how cristae structures impede the rate of diffusion of molecules in the mitochondrial matrix (inside both membranes) and of molecules between the membranes; including those inside the cristae. Evaluation of the impact of cristae on diffusion in the mitochondrial matrix will build on an existing Brownian dynamics algorithm for simulating diffusion inside a tube with obstacles. The specific outcome for this investigation of diffusion in the mitochondrial matrix will be a relationship between number and size of cristae to a decrease in diffusion. Evaluation of diffusion between the mitochondrial membranes will combine consideration of diffusion within and between cristae. Within cristae; diffusive escape will build on established narrow-escape problem solutions; while between cristae the confined volume will be considered as effectively two-dimensional. The specific outcome for this investigation of diffusion between the two mitochondrial membranes will be to assess the independence of concentrations between cristae.,AidanBrown,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,The student should have an academic background in physics; including math courses. The student should also have some computer programming/coding knowledge; either from courses or from personal experience; and enjoy computer programming/coding.

32849,Molecular Simulations Exploring the Stability and Mobility of Bulk Aqueous Nanobubbles,Bulk aqueous nanobubbles; gas-filled bubbles in water with typical diameters of ~100 nm; have only recently come under scientific investigation. While several features of nanobubbles are consistently reported; most notably their unexpected stability over long periods of time; there remains considerable uncertainty and debate regarding their nature. The focus of this work will be to investigate important questions about nanobubble behaviour; namely to identify the molecular origins for their unexpected stability. Molecular simulations will be performed to probe the molecular origins of the stability and mobility of bulk nanobubbles and to test theoretical models we have been recently developing. The key questions to be addressed include: 1) can forces arising from surface polarization that counter the Laplace pressure contribution be demonstrated by molecular simulations; 2) can molecular simulations confirm mobility of uncharged nanobubbles in electric fields. Large-scale MD simulations of empty nanobubbles of sizes ranging from 5 to 15 nm in systems up to ~5x105 molecules will be examined. The structure at the water surface; e.g. density profiles and dipole and quadrupole distributions; will be measured and results for different nanobubble sizes compared. Results will also be obtained for nonpolar (e.g. cyclopentane) and simple polar (e.g. CH3CN) liquids; since most experiments have focused on bulk nanobubbles in water. It has been conjectured that nanobubbles do not possess permanent charge and that their mobility is analogous to di-electrophoresis. To test this; extensive simulations will also be performed to measure responses; both mobility and any changes in surface structure; of nanobubbles to small applied electric fields. This work will provide key molecular-level insights into this fascinating phenomenon; thereby helping to guide new experiments and allowing us to predict in which liquids nanobubbles might be stable; while also yielding new fundamental understanding of some unique aspects of aqueous systems.,PeterKusalik,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-15,The student is expected to have the following skills/background: - A strong background in Chemistry (or related fields); particularly physical chemistry (2nd year University level). - Basic computer skills are a requirement; and experience with scientific computing and visualization (in a Linux environment) would be an asset. - Good foundation in mathematics (1st year university level). - Willingness to learn and a keen interest in the molecular world.,Chemistry; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Enviromental; Engg-Materials; Engg-Mechanical; Physics
32850,Thermal Image-based Fall Detection,This research project aims to advance the field of fall detection using thermal image processing and deep learning. Falls are a significant concern; especially for the elderly population; as falls can result in severe injuries or even fatalities. Detecting falls promptly is crucial for providing timely assistance and medical intervention. Thermal imaging has emerged as a promising technology for fall detection due to its ability to capture body heat patterns and operate in low-light conditions; whilst maintaining the anonymity of the elderly individual. However; accurately identifying falls in thermal images remains challenging due to limitations; like low resolution and the absence of color information. To address these challenges; this research project will investigate an ensemble approach with a combination of Autoencoder (AE) and 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN). In this case; autoencoders are semi-supervised learning models that learn to reconstruct their input; while 3D-CNN models excel at capturing spatiotemporal features from video-like data. By leveraging the strengths of both supervised and semi-supervised learning methodologies; the ensemble aims to enhance fall detection performance. To improve the quality of each component; the project will further investigate additional parameters; various baselines in ensemble learning; and transfer learning techniques. By expanding the architectural complexity and capacity of the models; the project aims to capture more nuanced patterns and features relevant to fall detection. Moreover; transfer learning enables the utilization of pre-trained models from related domains or tasks; which can provide valuable initializations and enhance the learning process. By pushing the boundaries of fall detection; this project aims to contribute to the development of effective and robust fall detection systems. The outcomes of this research project will have practical implications for healthcare systems; as accurate and timely fall detection can improve the well-being and safety of individuals; especially those vulnerable to fall-related injuries.,ThangarajahAkilan,Ontario,Lakehead University,English,2024-06-03,Ideal applicants are required to have a strong background in computer vision; deep learning; and image processing.

In general; the candidates are expected to have strong analytical and problem-solving skills; as well as the ability to plan their tasks; conduct experiments; analyze results; organize their findings; and draw meaningful conclusions are also essential for the success of this research project.,
32851,Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Growth of KDP Single-Crystal Fibres from Aqueous Solutions,Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) is one of the most investigated optoelectronic materials. Its unique piezoelectric; ferroelectric; and electro-optic properties are of great importance; and its birefringence and nonlinear optical properties have made KDP a general reference material. Large; high-quality KDP crystals are now frequently grown from aqueous solution. Yet; recent experiments have shown some rather intriguing crystal growth and nucleation behaviour from supersaturated KDP solutions. Three different polymorphs; one tetragonal (the expected stable phase) and two monoclinic; have been found to nucleate depending on the degree of supersaturation. Growth of single-crystal microfibers; indicative of quasi-one-directional crystal growth; have also been observed. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible have not yet been discovered; an apparent change in solution structure has been reported; and pre-nucleation clusters and multistep nucleation pathways have been proposed based on limited experimental evidence. Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations represent an excellent tool for probing questions such as: What is the nature of the structural changes as the supersaturation of an aqueous KDP solution increases? How might these changes couple to the observed nucleation pathways? Can these changes be responsible for the observed highly directional crystal growth of KDP? In this project; MD simulations will be performed for a model aqueous KDP solutions to explored how the solution structure changes with supersaturation. Two-phase crystal/solution systems will be set up under various levels of saturation and MD simulations performed to investigate the crystal growth behaviour and the structure at the crystal interface for different crystal faces of both the tetragonal and monoclinic crystal polymorphs. Several novel methods; involving advance molecular simulation; visualization and analysis tools; will be used in conjunction with non-equilibrium MD simulations to provide important new insights into the key mechanisms of crystal growth and details of the molecular structure of KDP systems.,PeterKusalik,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-15,The student is expected to have the following skills/background: - A strong background in Chemistry; particularly physical chemistry (2nd year University level). - Basic computer skills are a requirement; and experience with scientific computing and visualization (in a Linux environment) would be an asset. - Good foundation in mathematics (1st year university level). - Willingness to learn and a keen interest in the molecular world.,Chemistry; Engg-Chemical; Engg-Materials; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Metallurgical
32852,Web-development and client-server architecture for object-storage-based data portal in digital agriculture,TerraByte is at the forefront of research where machine learning intersects with agriculture with the goal to optimize food production. The project encompasses three core pillars: generating labeled plant data; developing machine learning models; and constructing a comprehensive plant image database. The generation of labeled plant data is the first key aspect of TerraByte's research. With embedded and robotic systems; the team captures a diverse range of plant images. This process has resulted in the creation of hundreds of thousands of labeled plant images; a dataset that covers various plant types; for example weeds and staple crops such as Canola and Soybeans. Further TerraByte has expanded its data acquisition techniques to include hyperspectral and 3D imaging; as well as collection of data in the fields through drones and rovers. By generating comprehensive and accurate labeled plant data; TerraByte ensures a solid foundation for subsequent machine learning applications in agriculture. The development of machine learning models forms another critical component of TerraByte's research project. Leveraging high-performance GPU servers; the team trains deep neural networks using our extensive repository of labeled plant images. These models will become the “brains” of future agricultural agents; capable of performing tasks such as classifying plants as crops or weeds or evaluating the well-being of individual plants. The third pillar of TerraByte is the construction of a comprehensive plant image database. All the data generated by TerraByte is stored and made accessible to researchers and the wider public through our own online portal. The team is continuously developing a user-friendly front-end that enables efficient browsing; filtering; and retrieval of the data based on specific application requirements. By providing open access to this extensive plant image database; TerraByte facilitates collaboration; knowledge sharing; and accelerates advancements within both the research community and the agriculture industry.,MichaelBeck,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-15,The ideal student for this position should have a strong background in computer science or a related field; with proficiency in database management (MongoDB); web development; and Python programming.

In any case problem-solving abilities and collaboration skills are essential.,
32853,CO2 diffusion through Nanocomposite membrane,Nanocomposite protective layers are generally used to improve mechanical strength and barrier properties. However; for developing an improved nanocomposite protective material; the physical and engineering phenomenon representing the actual permeation process should be known. Therefore; it is essential to characterize the transportation process of permeants and their interactions with the barrier nanocomposite protective layers. Though there are several models used in characterizing transportation behavior; the advection-diffusion-reaction model is preferred due to its competence in governing the physical and engineering process of permeation. Since the diffusion phenomena are directly associated with discrete atomic events of molecular diffusion and their interactions; it negotiates the requirement for nano (atomistic) scale numerical modeling. Moreover; the nanofillers used in reinforcing nanocomposites will also affect the molecules' diffusive motions and modulate the diffusion process; thus emphasizing the importance of including the alignment of nanofillers and interfacial adhesion between the nanofillers and the polymer matrix within the atomistic scale modeling. The interaction between the molecules and the composite liners will be quantified and expressed as a dependency of the diffusion coefficient. The atomistic results will then be coupled with the macroscale model for analyzing the electrochemical interactions on the protective layers. An advection-diffusion-reaction solver will be developed using the finite element method for analyzing the macroscale protection behavior of the nanocomposite protective layers.,SD JacobMuthu,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-20,The student should have a mechanical or materials engineering background.

32861,Freshwater Macroinvertebrate Diversity of the Coast Mountains,This research project is part of an interdisciplinary; multi-university collaboration to study climate change and recreation impacts to alpine ecosystems in south coastal British Columbia. The overall goal of the project is to project changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in this unique alpine zone; which is provides valuable recreation opportunities to the population of lower mainland B.C. but which is understudied ecologically. Because of the substantial precipitation received by Coast Mountains; it is not straightforward to extrapolate research findings from other mountain regions in Canada or globally. As part of the development of the project; we have identified a significant data and knowledge gap in terms of the freshwater invertebrate communities in alpine streams in the region. There is extremely minimal published data and no species list to work from; which makes it very challenging to predict how the biodiversity of these ecosystems may respond to climate change. Therefore; a key component of the overall research project – and one that the student on this specific project would contribute to – is filling this data gap by assembling data from unpublished studies and grey literature; and by conducting stream surveys in the alpine zone during the summer. With these two sources of data; we will be able to describe the freshwater invertebrate biodiversity of the Coast Mountain alpine zone. Freshwater invertebrates are key indicators of environmental conditions; so a subsequent goal is to identify potential indicator taxa that can be used to measure the pace of climate change and evaluate the impacts of recreational activities on aquatic ecosystems.,ChelseaLittle,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-27,The student should: - have undertaken some coursework in ecology or environmental science - be detail-oriented and organized - enjoy working both in a team (for fieldwork) and independently (for research into existing data).

32862,Consciousness and Creativity in brains and machines,The human brain displays rhythmic neuronal activity and complex network dynamics at multiple temporal and spatial scales. These neuronal activation patterns are present during active tasks but also during spontaneous resting states. Brain recording techniques used in our lab; such as MEG and EEG; directly measure neuronal activity and offers a high temporal resolution. Analyzing brain dyanmics using these methods carries the potential to significantly extend our knowledge of how the healthy brain operates and what causes its breakdown in neurological disorders. Several short-term project opportunities will be conducted. Some will focus on data from normal participants; others will examamine the alterations in data from neurological disorders. All projects will involve processing brain data with state-of-the-art techniques using advanced tools available in our lab. The methods used will include signal processing and machine-learning. In particular; calssification techniques (such as SVM; Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks) will be used to attempt to automatically differentiate brain states in healthy subjects; or to automatically identify brain dysfunction in patient data. Modeling projects; where deep neural network architectures are used to model information processing in biological networks are also available. All projects will be conducted in close collaboration with doctoral or post-doctoral students in the lab who will assist the students with their projects.

32863,From individual mindfulness to team success: Exploring relationships between individual and team mindfulness, team processes and outcomes.,An increasing number of organizations are employing teams to manage work. However; many teams operate inefficiently; affecting employee morale and profitability negatively. Given the widespread use of teams and their intricate dynamics; it's crucial to explore factors that enhance team efficiency and devise affordable strategies to boost team operations and outcomes. The proposed project will examine the mindfulness as a factor that may augment teamwork. Mindfulness – a state of present-focused nonjudgmental attention and awareness of internal processes (thoughts and emotions) and external stimuli (behaviours of others; nonverbal cues; environmental features) – has caught the interest of many scholars and practitioners. This is understandable given the wide array of benefits mindfulness provides to employees (Good et al.; 2016; Shahbaz & Parker; 2021). However; it remains unclear if these benefits extend to team contexts. This project will employ teamwork theories and mindfulness research to investigate (1) if and how the mindfulness levels of team members relate to a shared state of team mindfulness; and (2) if and how team mindfulness relates to team processes; engagement; and performance. This study serves to further the understanding of two key research areas – mindfulness and team dynamics. Firstly; it enhances mindfulness research by connecting two well-established research fields—individual and collective mindfulness. While these two phenomena bear similarities; they are distinct in theory (Sutcliffe et al.; 2016; Yu & Zellmer-Bruhn; 2018); and it is still uncertain how a group of individuals with diverse levels of mindfulness can collectively develop a shared mindfulness state. Secondly; the research contributes to both mindfulness and team dynamics studies by exploring how team mindfulness is linked to team processes and outcomes.,AnastasiaStuart-Edwards,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,An ideal candidate for this project has a background in organizational behavior or industrial psychology; has a foundational understanding of teams (especially input-process-output model); is able to read and critically assess academic articles; has advanced writing skills; has basic knowledge/some experience in at least one of the following: grounded theory analysis of qualitative data; linear regression/multilevel regression analysis (especially in RStudio); and has excellent time management skills.,Management
32864,Development of Sustainable Concrete Bridge Barrier using Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Bars,In 2007; The Residential and Civil Construction Alliance of Ontario (RCCAO) released a report on the state of Ontario bridges; entitled “Ontario’s Bridges: Bridging the Gap.” The report warns that the integrity of Ontario’s municipal bridge infrastructure and public safety are at risk after years of deferred maintenance and irregular inspections. The study noted that many of Ontario’s bridges were built in the 1950s and 1960s; and “it is expected that most bridges will require costly rehabilitation or replacement after 50 years of life.” Bridges built prior to the 1970’s did not use air-entrained concrete and coated reinforcing steel bars to protect from the effects of freeze-thaw cycles and the application of winter de-icing salt. This leads to corrosion-induced degradation in bridge decks and barrier that will need expensive replacement. The RCCAO report stated some recommendations to be made to promote the public’s safety and the sustainability of Ontario’s bridges. One of these recommendations includes promoting bridge engineering designs that improve the life expectancy and reduce maintenance costs of bridges. This can be achieved by using rust-free glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars. The proposed research is a continuation of Dr. Sennah’s research; supported by Ontario Ministry of Transportation and two GFRP manufacturers to develop crashworthy bridge barriers reinforced with rust-free bars. After being successful in developing PL-3 barriers for heavy-traffic highways (i.e. search for “Ryerson University Barrier” at www.youtube.com); the current research will be extended to develop sustainable PL-2 barrier for medium traffic-volume highways and municipal bridges. This research will include laboratory tests on the developed GFRP-reinforced PL-2 barrier under static loading to-collapse; simulating the equivalent static load to vehicle impact.,khaledSENNAH,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-15,The student must be finishing third year and going to the fourth year of the civil engineering program at the time of the intern.

32865,Development of a Simplified Analysis Method of Shear-Connected Girders due to Truck Loading for Accelerated Bridge Replacement,The evolution of the construction industry has revolutionized the way of building. Modular construction is one of the fastest-growing sectors of this very industry. Today; from housing to high-rise buildings to bridges; everything can be made using modular construction. Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) is an extensively used modular construction technique in North America. ABC involves the placement of pre-cast structural components to develop Bridges and Overpasses in a reduced amount of time. This technique is getting popular day by day due to speedy construction and less disruption to surrounding traffic flow. The broad utilization of ABC; which includes new construction; renovation; and reconstruction of existing bridge structures; has encouraged many researchers to conduct detailed study load transfer mechanisms and to develop efficient longitudinal and transverse connections. The pre-cast members used in ABC include pre-cast beams; slabs; piles; and abutments. There are many types of beams available to be used in ABC which include box girders; I girders; Tee girders; Double Tee girders and Inverted U girders etc. (PCI; 2014). In modular bridge construction; members are connected through longitudinal and transverse joints to transfer shear and moments effectively. Recent research has led to the development of efficient shear connections between box girder bridges; where; the transverse members are connected through a strip; filled ultra-high-performance concrete; called shear key (Sennah; 2020; Jajjawi; 2014). The provision of a shear key ensures transverse continuity across the bridge section for the transfer of vertical shear between adjacent girders. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code has no procedures or guidelines available to determine maximum transverse vertical shear for I; Tee; Double Tee or Inverted U girder bridges; for the design of shear keys under CHBDC truck loading. However; CHBDC design charts for the applied factored transverse vertical shear for shear-connected box beam bridges.,khaledSENNAH,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-15,The student must be finishing third year and going to the fourth year of the civil engineering program at the time of the intern.,
32866,Flow distribution in manifolds,Flows in manifolds are of great importance in quite diverse fields of science and technology; including fuel cells; spargers; solar collectors; microchannels; porous infiltration and irrigation. Study of flow distribution and pressure drop is vital to predict process performance and efficiency of manifold systems. In this project; students will perform research and development of theoretical models and methodology of solutions in flow in manifolds. The generalised model will be developed to be applicable to not only designs of continuum manifolds but also those of discrete manifolds with constant or varying factors. The theoretical model provides easy-to-use design guidance to investigate the interactions among structures; operating conditions and manufacturing tolerance under a wide variety of combination of flow conditions and geometries through three general characteristic characterization and to minimize the impact on manifold operability.

This project entails the synthesis of new N;O-chelating ligands and their complexation to early transition metals (Ti; Zr and Ta specifically). Synthetic protocols will afford opportunities to learn Schlenk line and glovebox preparatory techniques. All proligands and metal complexes will be rigorously characterized by NMR spectroscopy; mass spectrometry; elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography where appropriate. These novel coordination and organometallic complexes will then be investigated in catalytic reactions. Such reactions will be completed on small scale and monitored by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and/or NMR spectroscopy. In the case of asymmetric catalysis; ee's will be determined using chiral UHPLC. Products will be isolated using organic synthetic techniques for yield determination and full characterization. Data will be assembled that is consistent with publication standards in leading peer-reviewed journals.

32871,Robotic Imaging Systems for Collection of Labelled Plant Data in Digital Agriculture,TerraByte is at the forefront of research where machine learning intersects with agriculture with the goal to optimize food production. The project encompasses three core pillars: generating labeled plant data; developing machine learning models; and constructing a comprehensive plant image database. The generation of labeled plant data is the first key aspect of TerraByte's research. With embedded and robotic systems; the team captures a diverse range of plant images. This process has resulted in the creation of hundreds of thousands of labeled plant images; a dataset that covers various plant types; for example weeds and staple crops such as Canola and Soybeans. Further TerraByte has expanded its data acquisition techniques to include hyperspectral and 3D imaging; as well as collection of data in the fields through drones and rovers. By generating comprehensive and accurate labeled plant data; TerraByte ensures a solid foundation for subsequent machine learning applications in agriculture. The development of machine learning models forms another critical component of TerraByte's research project. Leveraging high-performance GPU servers; the team trains deep neural networks using our extensive repository of labeled plant images. These models will become the “brains” of future agricultural agents; capable of performing tasks such as classifying plants as crops or weeds or evaluating the well-being of individual plants. The third pillar of TerraByte is the construction of a comprehensive plant image database. All the data generated by TerraByte is stored and made accessible to researchers and the wider public through our own online portal. The team is continuously developing a user-friendly front-end that enables efficient browsing; filtering; and retrieval of the data based on specific application requirements. By providing open access to this extensive plant image database; TerraByte facilitates collaboration; knowledge sharing; and accelerates advancements within both the research community and the agriculture industry.,MichaelBeck,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-15,The ideal Mitacs Globalink student for this role should have a strong background in computer science; robotics; or a related field; with proficiency in programming languages such as Python or C++.

32872,Development of a remote data logging system for dendrometers,The research project aims to develop a logging device capable of efficiently collecting and transmitting data from circumference dendrometers deployed in field settings. A circumference dendrometer measures very precisely (at the resolution of micrometers) how tree trunks expand and shrink during the day and over seasons due to intake of water from the roots. These measurements (usually from several dendrometers at once) are sent to logging devices. Currently; these devices require physical visits for data retrieval via USB. The goal is to design and implement a remote data logging system that enables near real-time data access. The new logging devices will not only streamline the data collection process but also enhance the capabilities of the logging system by incorporating additional environmental sensors. These sensors could measure soil moisture; air humidity; air pressure; and temperature; providing comprehensive environmental data alongside tree growth measurements. The project will explore various logging platforms. One possible platform could leverage wireless communication technologies such as LoRaWAN or cellular networks to establish connectivity between the logging devices and a central data collection hub. The logging devices will autonomously transmit the collected data to the hub; enabling researchers to access the data remotely and in a timely manner. Efficient power management will be a critical aspect of the logging devices since they will operate in off-the-grid environments. Researchers will explore power-efficient hardware components; low-power communication protocols; and energy harvesting techniques (e.g.; solar panels) to ensure prolonged device operation without the need for frequent battery replacements or recharging. The research project will involve hardware design and prototyping; firmware development; and system integration. Furthermore; work will involve optimizing the data collection process and developing robust communication protocols for reliable data transmission in challenging field conditions.,MichaelBeck,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-15,We welcome students with backgrounds in electrical engineering; embedded systems; or related disciplines.

32873,Automatic Speaker Verification Robustness Towards Deepfake Speech,Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) has significantly matured over the last few years due to recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The deployment of voice recognition solutions has already become a reality in many fields (e.g.; financial; forensic; educational and general voice based assistants). Despite all the advances; malicious spoofing attacks have been recognized as a serious threat to ASV systems. Characterized by an attempt of a person or a program to illegitimately bypass security by masquerading one’s identity; there are growing concerns towards the vulnerability of ASV in the face of spoofing attacks; such as impersonation; replay attacks; speech synthesis; and voice conversion. Recently; the increasing sophistication of DNN models; capable of generating human-like content; is another threat to ASV systems. For instance; an attacker can manipulate public voice data (e.g.; posted on social media) in a malicious way and post the generated deepfake speech; which resembles the voice of a victim; with the intention to harm the her/his reputation. In this research project; we are concerned with deepfake speech signals in which an adversary fabricates an utterance in the voice of a target speaker in order to deceive an ASV system. Such fabricated signal can be used by an impostor to adopt another person's identity to gain access to their assets. Our main goal will be to develop countermeasures to improve ASV robustness which will consequently mitigate identity theft based on deepfake speech signal.,AndersonRaymundo Avila,Québec,Université INRS,English,2024-05-06,• Pursuing a degree in Computer Science; Computer Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Mathematics or equivalent. • Knowledge in Python • Knowledge in machine learning theory and practice (especially deep learning). • Energetic; self-motivated and execution-oriented individuals that are passionate about producing new knowledge.,Computer Science; Engg-Computer
32874,Valuation of data during machine learning training processes for improved model performances,In this research program; we aim to investigate the value and costs associated with data throughout its entire lifecycle in the context of machine learning (ML). We research the interplay between data collection and usage; with ML model performance informing the data collection process and vice versa. The program revolves around three main objectives. Objective 1: We develop lightweight surrogate models and heuristics that integrate the costs of data collection into a mixed objective function. Traditional methods of data valuation are computationally expensive or fail to consider collection costs; making them unsuitable for real-time or edge device execution. By addressing this limitation; we aim to enable efficient and cost-effective data collection strategies that optimize model performance. Objective 2: We redefine data value by incorporating data age and propose strategies for replacing deprecated samples in existing ML models. Current data valuation methods assume stationary sample distributions and overlook the potential for individual data points to become outdated. Our research will address these limitations; particularly in applications where data relevance evolves over time; such as finance or security. Objective 3: We develop innovative data-driven strategies to enhance the efficiency of model training. Using learning curves; we can estimate model performance based on training volume; enabling faster model exploration and optimization. Additionally; we leverage lightweight surrogate models to identify redundancies within ML datasets; facilitating the removal of samples that impede the training process. By streamlining the training mechanisms; we can improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of ML models.,MichaelBeck,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-15,The ideal student for this role should have a strong foundation in machine learning and data analysis.

32875,Cloud resource allocation using stochastic network calculus,This research project investigates and applies Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC). SNC is a mathematical framework that enables the modeling; analysis; and optimization of networked systems under stochastic conditions; meaning that arrivals of workload and the speed at which it is processed is considered random. The project focuses on exploring the core concepts; theoretical foundations; and practical implications of SNC in diverse scenarios such as communication networks. In this project we delve into the fundamental principles of SNC; including queuing theory; stochastic processes; and performance metrics. We employ these concepts to assess and evaluate the performance of networks; considering factors such as backlog (queue length); latency; packet loss; throughput; and other crucial performance indicators. The project involves the development of mathematical models and simulations to accurately represent and analyze the behavior of networks. Then we use these models to investigate network performance under varying conditions; workloads; and traffic patterns. By conducting simulations; we gain valuable insights into network design; resource allocation; and optimization strategies. Optimization techniques based on SNC will be explored to enhance the performance and resource utilization of networks. Further; the results of SNC themselves often contain many free parameters that contribute in complex ways to the achieved performance metrics and thus must be optimized. We thus devise algorithms and policies for efficient traffic management; routing; scheduling; and other network-related aspects. These optimization strategies will contribute to improving network efficiency; reliability; and overall quality of service. The findings and methodologies derived from this research project will have practical applications in a wide range of networked domains; including telecommunications systems; data centers; Internet of Things (IoT) networks; and cloud computing infrastructures.

32878,Deep learning for face recognition and multi-Biometrics,The use of biometric techniques for the assessment of affective and cognitive status is an emerging area of research. The goal is to extract salient features that can help predict an individual's affective and cognitive state in order to intervene when necessary (social problems) or to personalize the individual's experience (business problems).

32891,Triboelectric generators,Triboelectric nanogenerators convert mechanical energy into electricity; however their most exciting feature is the use of biocompatible dielectric layers as their active material and substrates; hence their ease of application in wearable technologies and human-machine interfaces. Therefore; advanced materials engineering is applied to develop polymeric thin films that act as charged triboelectric layers; with the aim of generating electricity through friction. Optimization of these layers is crucial to increase surface charge density; and in turn the electricity generated. This is achieved through the introduction of microstructures to the thin film’s surface; and the addition of compounds to the polymer matrix through additive reactions and surface functionalization; which leads to an increase in the overall surface charge density. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an omniphobic thin film with the use of electrospinning technology; producing a microstructured triboelectric polymer ready for use in a wearable generator device.

32893,A metaheuristic Algorithm for Breast Cancer Classification and Diagnosis,Optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm; Particle Swarm Optimization; Ant Colony Optimization etc. may be used to build classification models. The obtained classification model can be further used for diagnostic purposes. But; none of the available optimization algorithms are precise and leaves us with the scope of improvement in classification sensitivity and specificity. UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository provides open access to 301 datasets. Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset is chosen for our cancer classification study. The breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure which involves the insertion of a thin needle into an abnormal appearing tissue area or body fluid. In the WDBC dataset; each record represents follow-up data for consecutive patients seen. Each data entry consists of cell nuclei characteristics like radius; texture; perimeter; area; smoothness; compactness; concavity; concave points; symmetry and fractal dimension. Metaheuristic algorithms are popular for solving complex optimization problems. Bio-inspired algorithms are very efficient as it imitates the best features in nature. In this project; we plan to study cancer prediction through the cell nucleus of breast mass and use WDBC dataset; which illustrates the instances of malignant and benign breast cancer and the cell nucleus features associated with it. We would like to propose a metaheuristic algorithm. The algorithm has been modified to be suitable to carry out classification rule mining. Through the proposed algorithm application on WDBC dataset; we will drive classification rule which can be used in decision making process during breast cancer diagnosis. The rule derived emphasizes that the malignant breast cells can be distinguished from benign cells; based on irregularity in shape of the cell nucleus.

32894,Predicting Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 by optimization technique,The world population is being quickly infected by the SARS-COV-2 virus pandemic (is known as Covid-19). Covid-19 has grown very quick throughout the countries; with a very high contagion rate; spreading all continents in just over three months since the first confirmed case in China. The numbers have grown exponentially reaching; roughly; more than 3.7 million cases and more than a quarter of a million deaths. In the current study; we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming 14 days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using swarm algorithm.

It offers flexibility in figuring out nonlinearity in the time series data; as well as integrating the features of both artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic systems. It has been employed in variety of forecasting applications such as a stock price forecasting model and weather models. In this project; we plan to study an efficient predicting model to predict the confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in China (Italy) for the upcoming ten days based on previously confirmed cases. 2.

32895,A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for multilevel thresholding image segmentation,Thresholding is one of the known methods in image segmentation (IS). It has two classes: bi-level thresholding (BT) and multilevel thresholding (MT). The BT divides the image into two categories; whereas MT is utilized to segment complex images and it can generate multiple thresholds; which divide pixels into multiple similar parts based on intensity. BT can generate enough outcomes in the case that the image contains only two principal gray levels; but the foremost restriction is the time-consuming computation which is often high when it is extended to MT. Researchers get the optimal thresholds by maximizing some criteria such as the Otsu criterion and Kapur’s entropy. In the Otsu-based method; the best threshold is the one that maximizes the between-class variance of the regions. Kapur’s entropy measures the homogeneity of the classes by using the maximization of the entropy. Thus; the selection of optimal thresholds in multilevel is an NP-hard problem. When the threshold number is small; classical techniques are appropriate; but if this number grows; the accuracy of segmentation will be influenced. Therefore; to overcome this drawback; many swarm intelligence algorithms (SIAs) have been applied and combined with thresholding algorithms In this project; we develop a new hybrid metaheuristic by combining Otsu’s criterion and Kapur’s entropy (combination of both) to determine MT for IS. We will use our new hybrid algorithm as a preprocessing method prior to the IS. The image is preprocessed to get the optimum pixels and then k-means clustering is applied to the image for segmentation. Also; we compare our proposed approach with other existing approaches in the literature and apply nonparametric statistical tests to show the superiority of our proposed algorithm over other algorithms. We will use various image databases of Berkeley University and other resources.,MohamedTawhid,British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-01,Writing extensive computer programs in Python; or R; or Matlab; Knowing swarm intelligence algorithms and optimization will be assets.

32896,Solving a vehicle routing problem by swarm intelligence algorithm,In the last decade; new insights and algorithms have been obtained for the classical deterministic VRP as well as for natural stochastic and dynamic variations of it. These new developments are based on theoretical analysis; combined probabilistic and combinatorial modeling; and lead to new and effective algorithms and a deeper understanding of uncertainty issues in vehicle routing problems. The VRP is an NP-hard problem with many extensions such as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The goal of this project is to use and develop swarm intelligence algorithm for a provider of software planning tools for distribution logistics companies. The algorithm computes a daily plan for a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles; that can depart from different depots and must visit a set of customers for delivery operations. Besides multiple capacities and time windows associated with depots and customers; the problem considers incompatibility constraints between goods; depots; vehicles and customers; maximum route length and durations; upper limits on the number of consecutive driving hours and compulsory drivers’ rest periods; the possibility to skip some customers and to use express courier services instead of the given fleet to fulfill some orders; the option of splitting up the orders; and the possibility of “open” routes that do not terminate at depots. Moreover; the cost of each vehicle route is computed through a system of fares; depending on the locations visited by the vehicle; the distance traveled; the vehicle load and the number of stops along the route. We will develop hybrid swarm intelligence algorithms (combine two algorithms) and show the perofrmance of the proposed algorithm by comparing other algorithms in the literature and applying on-parametric statistical tests to show the superority of the proposed algorithm.,MohamedTawhid,British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-01,Writing extensive computer programs in Python; or R or Matlab; Knowing swarm intelligence algorithms and optimization will be assets.,Computer Science; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Industrial; Engg-Software; Engineering; Management; Management Information Systems; Mathematics
32897,Swarm Intelligence algorithms and routing in wireless sensor networks,Due to advances in low-power wireless communications; low-power analog and digital electronics; the development of low-cost and low-power sensor nodes that are small in size has received increasing attention. Sensor nodes have the ability to sense the environment nearby; perform simple computations and communicate in a small region. Although their capacities are limited; combining these small sensors in large numbers provides a new technological platform; called Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). WSNs provide reliable operations in various application areas including environmental monitoring; health monitoring; vehicle tracking system; military surveillance and earthquake observation In this project; we will present a new protocol for WSN routing operations. The protocol is achieved by using Swarm Intelligence algorithms (such as Hybrid Genetic Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm; and Hybrid recent swarm Algorithms ) based optimization technique in network routing to optimize routing paths; providing an effective multi-path data transmission method to achieve reliable communications in the case of node faults. We will aim to maintain network life time at a maximum; while data transmission is achieved efficiently; so an adaptive approach is developed according to this goal. The proposed approaches are compared to a well known other algorithms such as ant based algorithm named EEABR using an event-based simulator. Our goal is to offer significant reductions of energy consumption which is used as a performance metric for different sized WSNs. Also; we will implement our approach on a small sized hardware component requiring minimum connections suitable for tiny node designs and we will develop an methods for handling the routing tasks by using the proposed approaches router chip. We will test the performace of the proposed algorithms by comparing the proposed algorithm with other existing swarm algorithm in the literature and applying non-parameteric statistical tests.,MohamedTawhid,British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-01,Writing extensive computer programming (Python; or Matlab software or R or others); Swarm Intelligence algorithms Writing report and using statistical nonparametric tests,
32898,Examining the Use of Social Impact Bonds in Community Sports Programs,Sports are widely considered a tool to promote health; well-being; and psychosocial development; especially among youth. This is particularly relevant in underserved communities that rely on sports to teach important life skills that will help youths’ future success. Thus; community sports organizations are critical to providing opportunities for individuals to enjoy the physical; psychological; and social benefits of sports. Financially supporting these programs is of key interest to federal and provincial/state governments. Governments seek ways to allocate and disburse funding for community organizations to deliver sports initiatives that increase participation among underrepresented groups. One strategy is Social Impact Bonds (SIBs); which are outcome-based contracts between social investors and the public sector that aim to attract private funding for pressing social issues. With SIBs; investors provide upfront funding for community initiatives seeking social and financial returns; and governing authorities pay the investors if their community initiatives achieve predetermined targeted social outcomes. SIBs were developed in the UK and are largely present in Europe and the US. Canada has eight SIBs projects providing services in health; child and family welfare; etc. However; none of these provide sport-based services. Given its potential to increase private funding and improve the allocation and disbursement of government funding; using SIBs in sport-related projects in Canada can further improve the positive impact of sports in underserved Canadian communities and their youth. As such; the purpose of this study is to examine the facilitators and barriers to implementing sport-based SIBs in Quebec; Canada. The questions guiding this research are: (a) What are the key characteristics of SIBs projects in Canada (e.g.; how do they work; how were they implemented; and who are the key stakeholders)? (b) What are the key characteristics of sport-based SIBs in other countries? (c) What social; economic; and political factor influence of SIBs?,WilliamFalcao,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have a background in management and/or sports sciences (e.g.; sport management; sport psychology; sport sociology).

32899,Development of Vapochromic Sensors using Coordination Polymer Materials for Detecting Toxic Gases,Our group research focuses on the general synthesis and characterization of coordination polymers for a range of applications. Coordination polymers are metal-containing solid-state materials that self-assemble from appropriately chosen building blocks and can be designed to show useful magnetic; optical; electronic properties or porosity (for example). The Leznoff lab concentrates on using metal-cyanides as building blocks for coordination polymers; particularly the unusual linear d10-metal M(CN)2- (M=Au;Ag) units; to take advantage of metallophilic interactions as supramolecular glue; and actively are designing useful functional materials that act as sensors; optical components; emissive materials etc.,DanielLeznoff,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-06,The student should have a substantial inorganic chemistry background: completed at least 3rd year inorganic chemistry lectures and laboratory and ideally some laboratory research experience as well would be preferred. Any experience that the student has with inorganic/materials chemistry synthetic methodology and crystal growth; characterization techniques including elemental analysis; FT-IR and Raman spectroscopies; UV-vis fluorescence spectroscopy; X-ray diffraction (single crystal and powder) structure solution is useful but the student intern will be trained in these areas over the course of the summer as appropriate and thus is not a prerequisite for the internship.,
32900,Examining National Sport Federations' Support of Athletes with a Disability: Stakeholders' Perceptions of Cycling Canada,Despite numerous calls for additional research in Parasports; studies in the fields of Management; Psychology; and Sport Sciences are still lacking. The limited knowledge of Parasport leads stakeholders (e.g.; athletic directors; coaches; and mental performance consultants) to either ignore the unique needs of Para-athletes with a disability or; more problematic; learn how to support them by trial-and-error. This can be detrimental to the psychological state of athletes; as well as their athletic performance. This is important because elite parasports; such as the Paralympics; are an important tool to advertise physical activity participation that can lead to physical and psychological benefits to individuals with a physical disability in the general population. However; despite the unique needs of athletes with a disability; elite parasport athletes continue to be affiliated to the National and International Governing Federation that regulates both the able body and parasport modalities of each sport. This raises questions regarding the kind and quality of services provided to athletes with a disability by the sporting Federation. As such; the purpose of this study is to examine the perceptions of Paralympic athletes; coaches; and sports administrators regarding the services provided by their National and International Governing Federations to support athletes with a disability. This study will be conducted with Paracycling athletes in Canada and address the following research questions: (a) Who are the key stakeholders in the National and International Governing Federations that support the work of elite athletes with a disability? (b) What services are provided and how do they address the specific needs of athletes with a disability? (c) What can these Federations improve to better serve athletes with a disability?,WilliamFalcao,Québec,Concordia University,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The student must have a background in management and/or sports sciences (e.g.; sport management; sport psychology; sport sociology).

32901,Design and development of a patient-controlled health information repository using the Solid web-decentralization framework,Over the last two decades; healthcare has moved from a paper-based reality to an electronic one. But the transition has taken place in a piecemeal manner and it is disjointed and incomplete. As a result; healthcare data are fragmented and scattered in digital silos. Although many projects have tried to break down these digital silos; none have succeeded and a new approach is needed. Therefore; in this project we will explore a completely new way to manage healthcare data by putting them fully under the control of patients using the Solid web-decentralization framework of Tim Berners Lee (solidproject.org).,JohnKildea,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-06,Experience with data handling and software development; ideally using Python and Django.

32903,Software Solutions and Algorithms for Compressed Data Structures,Data structures such as tensors; graphs; and meshes are widely used in AI and scientific applications; but they often require large amounts of storage and computation. Compression techniques can reduce data movement and the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) by exploiting the sparsity or redundancy of these data structures. However; compression techniques also introduce challenges for software design and algorithm development; such as irregular code patterns and trade-offs between accuracy and memory usage. This research explores new software solutions and algorithms that can efficiently operate on compressed data structures. • Research Problem: The research problem is to design software solutions and algorithms that can iterate over compressed data structures efficiently while maintaining or improving the accuracy and scalability of AI and scientific applications. • Methods: The research methods include developing new lossy and lossless compression techniques for high-order tensors; graphs; and meshes; designing new parallel algorithms for sparse tensor algebra and numerical optimization; and implementing software frameworks that can generate optimized code for compressed data structures. • Results: The research results show that the proposed compression techniques can significantly reduce the storage costs and FLOPs of various AI and scientific applications; such as computer graphics; pruned neural networks; linear solver preconditioners; and factorization. The research also shows that the proposed software solutions and algorithms can achieve high performance and scalability on different platforms; such as CPUs; GPUs; and distributed systems.,KazemCheshmi,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-01,This project requires students who are passionate about creating new computing systems and who have excellent problem-solving skills.

32904,Enabling Machine Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems,By enabling the interaction and coordination of computational; physical; and human elements in cyber-physical systems (CPS); various goals such as efficiency; safety; resilience; and adaptability can be achieved. However; real-time constraints can pose a challenge for machine learning models that show promising results in several CPS goals due to the limited memory and computing resources in controllers used in CPS. Tensor algebra kernels such as matrix multiplication are necessary to execute ML models stored as tensors; which can be memory and computation intensive. Although many accelerators are used in servers and embedded devices to speed up ML workloads; industrial controllers typically rely on a single-core CPU with limited memory size ranging from 2KB to 512MB; and the processor's instruction issue rate lower than GHz; making it much more restrictive than server processors. Therefore; ML models for CPS must be modified to use lower memory and computing resources efficiently. This project aims to build a framework for CPS; such as drones and small robots; to facilitate the creation of new applications benefiting from ML models. The framework supports a wide range of algorithms and modules such as model predictive control; Kalman filter; autopilot algorithm; and image processing used in industrial controllers. Additionally; the framework should consider the real-time and memory constraints of the target architecture.,KazemCheshmi,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-01,This project requires students who are passionate about creating new computing systems and who have excellent problem-solving skills.

32905,Heterogenous Programming for Accelerating Artificial Intelligence Applications,When it comes to creating machine learning applications; software frameworks are incredibly helpful. They can automatically generate code that is optimized for the hardware being used; making the process much more efficient. These frameworks take a high-level description of the application and convert it into an intermediate representation expressed as a task graph. The vertices within this graph represent tensor operations; while the edges show dependence between them. Graph partitioning techniques are used to ensure that the load is balanced across CPUs and GPUs; enabling parallel execution. To optimize the task graph further; ML frameworks use algebraic transformations to rewrite some tensor operations with more efficient ones. This is done using algebraic and domain information. Once the optimized task graph is created; it is passed to back-end compilers such as LLVM to generate optimized code for a given architecture. This is an ongoing computational challenge; as finding efficient graph-level and architecture-specific transformations is not always an easy task. To solve this issue; heuristic approaches such as hierarchical search and genetic algorithms are used to find efficient schedules. Verification techniques are also important to ensure that the program is correct and that different transformation combinations can be explored. As AI models continue to grow in size; it becomes more challenging to build a fast and power-efficient program using all the available resources. To address this issue; this project is exploring new code generation techniques that can benefit the heterogeneity of existing architectures. For example; CPUs; GPUs; and domain-specific accelerators such as tensor cores can be used to improve performance. A new search heuristic will also be developed to select the most efficient compiler transformations and tuning parameters. Overall; software frameworks are an essential tool for creating machine learning applications; and they continue to evolve to meet the demands.,KazemCheshmi,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-01,This project requires students who are passionate about creating new computing systems and who have excellent problem-solving skills.

32906,Depression at Work: An Systematic Review of Literature,According to recent data from the World Health Organization (2023); an estimated 280 million individuals worldwide are grappling with depression – a debilitating mental disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness; loss of interest and pleasure in daily activities; spanning over a prolonged period. This indicates an overwhelming prevalence of this mental health concern globally. Depression carries significant economic implications. The high costs of depression are predominantly borne by employers; a major portion of which arises from a decline in employee performance (Stewart et al.; 2003). Work-related stressors; while not always the primary cause; can exacerbate the intensity of depressive disorders (Bonde; 2016). Despite the pervasiveness and costs of depression; little is known about how it affects employee experiences and outcomes as well as when and how work environment can alleviate or worsen the symptoms. This scarcity of research; I argue; could be attributed at least in part; to the deficient integration of depression within theoretical frameworks of organizational behavior and industrial psychology. To address the void in the current body of knowledge; this project is designed with the objective of collating existing empirical evidence on depression in the workplace by employing a systematic literature review methodology. The goal of this comprehensive examination is to develop a conceptual framework that encompasses the multifaceted aspects of workplace depression. This framework is expected to provide a robust scaffold to support and guide future research endeavors in this critical area of mental health. This comprehensive research initiative can potentially contribute to the advancement of our understanding of depression in a professional context; illuminating the ways to foster healthier; more supportive; and more productive workplaces.,AnastasiaStuart-Edwards,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,A successful candidate will be able to follow specific instructions to search scientific databases; read academic articles; and summarize them using a template.

32907,Enhancing the recovery of critical metals, indium and germanium, from lead and zinc slag,Indium (In) and germanium (Ge) are technologically important elements with applications in electronics; solar cells; power amplifiers; and catalysts. Demand for them is projected to increase by 225% and 2130%; respectively; by 2050. However; In and Ge are rare metals; found in 50-200 ppb and 1.6 ppm in the earth’s crust; with current dissipation rates of ~90% and ~99%; respectively. They are the by-products of lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) production. It is essential to improve their recovery rates during the process; currently limited by inadequate knowledge of their thermodynamic behavior in a multi-phase and multi-element chemical system. Understanding the thermodynamic behavior of a complex process solely based on trial and error is challenging. Alternatively; the thermodynamic behavior of indium oxide (In2O3) and germanium oxide (GeO2) in the PbO-ZnO-FeOx-CaO-SiO2 (PZFCS) slag can be modeled. A dilute solution of these components in slag (typically in the order of 300-400 ppm) is of practical interest. Therefore; the assumption of the constant activity coefficients for In2O3 and GeO2; independent of composition; could be reasonable. We can assume that their behaviors conform to Henry’s law (ai=γi.xi; where ai is the activity of either In2O3 or GeO2; γi is the activity coefficient which is constant; and xi is the concentration in slag). With the advancement in the field of computational thermodynamics; it is possible to add In2O3 and GeO2 as dilute species to the available database (PZFCS) in the thermochemical software FactSage; and predict their thermodynamic behavior under a set of operational parameters (reduction extent equivalent to an oxygen partial pressure; temperature; flux addition). The outcomes of this project in combination with the thermodynamic behavior of In and Ge in metal and gas; already available; will enable us to better control the operational parameters to increase the recovery of In and Ge.,ElmiraMoosavi-Khoonsari,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Studying in the field of materials science and engineering; metallurgy; or geochemistry Knowledge of thermochemistry and thermodynamics of inorganic materials Knowledge of thermochemical software such as FactSage or Thermo-Calc is an asset Hardworking and motivated to complete a challenging capstone project with many important real-world applications Good time-management; planning; and organizational skills Good critical thinking; and problem-solving skills Good communication and teamwork skills,Engg-Materials
32908,Identification and characterization of DDX41-binding proteins by BioID and affinity pulldown,DDX41 (DEAD-box helicase 41) is a member of the DEAD-box helicase family. It senses intracellular DNA in the myeloid dendritic cells and secondary messengers such as cyclic di-GMP or cyclic di-AMP to activate type I interferon immune response upon viral or bacterial infections. We recently found that DDX41 is required for cGAS-STING activation against DNA virus infection (Cell Reports: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110856). Hematological disorders like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been associated with mutations in DDX41; where the most common somatic mutations is c.1574G>A; p.R525H. Recent studies have shown that DDX41 is a spliceosomal protein and it interacts with different proteins in spliceosomal C complex; and the R525H mutant alters its splicing activity owing to its altered interaction with major snRNPs like U2 and U5. Our lab has found that DDX41 displayed a dynamic protein expression pattern and sub-cellular localization under disparate stress conditions. However; the factors which regulate these dynamic changes remain unknown. Therefore; we hypothesize that the functions and sub-cellular localization of DDX41 may be regulated by its interacting proteins. To testify our hypothesis; we will use the technique of Biotin Identification (BioID) and affinity purification pulldown to identify and characterize DDX41 interacting proteins.,YuliangWu,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Background and skills in biology and life science; especially in biochemistry; molecular biology; genetics; and medical science.,Biochemistry
32909,Role of DDX41 in P-bodies Assembly and its Connection to MDS/AML,DDX41 is a DEAD-box helicase and acts as an intracellular DNA sensor for type I interferon production in vertebrates upon virial infection. Mutations in DDX41 cause myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DDX41 point mutation R525H is the most frequently identified patient mutation. Processing bodies (P-bodies) are membraneless organelles formed by ribonucleoprotein aggregates located in the cytoplasm. P-bodies play an important role in mRNA storage; mRNA decay; and translation repression. We recently found that DDX41 is required for cGAS-STING pathways for type I interferon production; which dysregulation leads to MDS/AML (Cell Reports: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110856). In addition; we found that there is reduced P-bodies formation in DDX41 knockout cells; indicating DDX41 is required for P-bodies assembly; however; the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesize that DDX41 is essential for P-body assembly and failure of P-body assembly might lead to MDS/AML. To test this; using DDX41 CRISPR knockout cell line (compared with wild type); we will challenge the cells with poly (dA:dT) (a DNA mimics); sodium arsenite (oxidative stress); and herpes simplex virus (HSV-1); then examine EDC4; 4E-T; and LSM14A's expressing by qPCR (mRNA level) and Western blot (protein level). Because EDC4; 4E-T; and LSM14A bind to each other; and this complex is pivotal for P-bodies formation; we will determine the EDC4; 4E-T; and LSM14A interactions by Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Lastly; we will reconstitute DDX41 knockout cells with DDX41-R525H mutant (compared with DDX41-WT) and examine the status of P-bodies formation.,YuliangWu,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Background and skills in biology and life science; especially in biochemistry; molecular biology; genetics; and medical science.,Biochemistry
32910,Identifying Synthetic Lethality Targets in DDX41-mutated MDS/AML,DDX41 is a DEAD-box helicase. Mutations in DDX41 cause myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the missense mutation R525H is found in over 70% of affected patients. MDS/AML typically occurs in the ageing population but can also occur in younger individuals due to inherited mutations; including DDX41. Direct targeting DDX41 is challenging because DDX41 is one of the 37 DEAD-box helicases in humans that share a similar structure. Synthetic lethality (SL) represents an effective strategy instead of direct targeting. Two genes are said to exhibit SL interaction; if the loss of function of both these genes affects cellular viability; while neither has any effect on their own. Collaborating with Dr. Franco Vizeacoumar’s group; we have used bioinformatic analyses and identified several potential SL interactions of DDX41. Using DDX41 knockout cell lines that we established (Singh et al.; 2022); we validated some potential SL candidates by shRNA knockdown and drug inhibitors. In this project; we will continue to use cell-based assays to validate the SL hits generated by computational methods. Second; we will use a pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify SL interactions of DDX41. Third; combining computational analysis and CRISPR screening; we will choose and validate some hits in cell-based and mouse models of DDX41-mutated MDS/AML. Our success in this proposal will significantly improve the treatment and survival of MDS/AML patients by identifying novel targets for DDX41 mutated blood cancers.,YuliangWu,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Background and skills in biology and life science; especially in biochemistry; molecular biology; genetics; and medical science.,

32916,Architecture as spatial and social fabric: Japanese perspectives to promote multi-scale relationships,Tokyo is the emblem of a city that has become denser over time. Faced with multiple opportunities and challenges; this metropolis has always been a pioneer in exploring new solutions for high-density housing. In recent years; cases of social isolation and confinement have rapidly increased due to the densification and change of lifestyle towards the individualization of society; in Japan as elsewhere. As a response to this trend; new architectural concepts have been created and tested for individual home improvement. The objective is to understand which architectural elements promote social interaction through the socio-spatial analysis of four dwellings designed for single people.,AliceCovatta,Québec,Université de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-04-30,Students need to be knowledgeable of qualitative analysis (i.e. ethnographic methods such as participant observation; interviews; and archival research or others) or qualitative data analysis software (like Nvivo) or Japanese studies research or Asian studies research or Japanese language.,Architecture; Anthropology; Asian Studies; Cultural Studies; East Asian Studies; Japanese Language; Japanese Studies
32917,Utilisation de la méthode de Lattice Boltzmann pour la prédiction numérique de l’orientation des fibres dans le béton fluide,Le projet de recherche vise à développer une interface de modélisation 3D sous Python pour la modélisation de l’écoulement fluide de béton fibré en utilisant la méthode de Lattice Botzmann (LBM). Cette méthode est de plus en plus utilisée en mécanique des fluides; et se distingue par rapport aux méthodes CFD conventionnelles utilisant les équations de Navier-Stokes (Éléments finis et volumes finis) par le fait qu’elle est basée sur des particules et ne nécessite donc pas de maillage. Les méthodes particulaires sont développées depuis plusieurs décennies et commencent à émerger récemment pour des applications industrielles complexes. Parmi elles; la méthode Lattice-Boltzmann (LBM) qui résout bon nombre des inconvénients présentés par les méthodes CFD traditionnelles : le processus de maillage est supprimé car la simulation repose sur une génération automatique de treillis; la formulation mathématique de l'équation de transport de Boltzmann est naturellement simple à résoudre numériquement et se prête bien au calcul parallèle impliquant des centaines de mini-cœurs GPU. Ce projet Mitacs s’insère dans un cadre plus global qui vise la modélisation du comportement mécanique des éléments en béton fibré et l’optimisation des séquences de coulée pour une performance optimale. Le comportement mécanique de ces éléments utilisant ce nouveau matériau performant est très dépendant de l’orientation des fibres lors de la phase de coulée.

32918,Efficient Network Architecture Search for Visual Recognition,This research project aims at improving the computational efficiency of network architecture search (NAS). Deep networks such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks have shown impressive results in the last years; sometimes even reaching human level performance. However; these approaches require the manual tuning of many hyper-parameters (e.g. number of layers; type of activation function; number of neurons; etc..); which can require a brute-force optimization and/or human expertise. To overcome the manual tuning of hyper-parameters; NAS aims to find techniques to automatically discover the optimal configuration of such networks. The main drawback of such approach is the exponential large number of configurations that should considered and therefore the computational cost required to automatically optimize the networks hyper-parameters. In this project we aim at reducing the computational cost of NAS. Recently; some methods have shown that some of the hyper-parameters are differentiable (or can formulated in a differentiable way) and therefore their optimization can be speeded-up by using gradient based approaches. In this project we will further investigate those approaches; by analyzing in which conditions they can provide good results and extending the range of hyper-parameters that can be optimized with this methodology. The proposed method will be evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy of the found architectures as well as computational cost on standard computer vision datasets such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In case of positive results; the work will be submitted to a peer-reviewed conference article or a journal in the field.,MarcoPedersoli,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,English,2024-06-02,- Strong mathematical background - Strong programming (possibly Python and pytorch) and algorithm development skills - Knowledge and previous experience on basic Deep Learning and Computer VIsion algorithms - Ability to collaborate in a project with other students,Engineering; Mathematics; Statistics

32920,Exploiting Traffic Accident Data for Optimal Emergency Vehicles Routing Strategy,High-density cities face a high risk of traffic accidents; posing a threat to vehicle occupants; cyclists; and pedestrians. Efficient response times from emergency services are crucial in such situations. Openly available traffic accident data in Canadian cities has been utilized to develop predictive models that enhance city safety measures; including speed limit reductions and infrastructure modifications. However; this data can also be leveraged to anticipate accidents; thereby reducing emergency service response times. This research proposal aims to devise a patrol strategy for emergency vehicles by utilizing publicly available traffic accident data. By analyzing accident data from cities like Halifax; which includes accident time and location; researchers can investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of accidents and construct a predictive model. Subsequently; a routing strategy can be developed using this model to position emergency vehicles in close proximity to accident locations as they occur. Integrating traffic accident data into patrol strategies has the potential to significantly reduce emergency response times and minimize the occurrence of fatal accidents. The proposed research focuses on developing an optimal routing strategy based on open traffic accident data to minimize emergency vehicle response times in urban environments. The Dynamic Travel Repairman Problem (DTRP) is a mathematical model suitable for dynamic routing problems where the objective is to minimize service wait times in environments with dynamically generated tasks. In this context; tasks represent accidents requiring emergency services; and the probability distribution of accidents can be derived from real data. Utilizing open-access traffic accident data from major Canadian cities like Halifax and Toronto; a realistic DTRP model will be created. Similar to previous works; Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be employed to solve DTRPs by learning an optimal strategy.,Jean-Alexis Delamer,Nova Scotia,St. Francis Xavier University,English,2024-05-15,We are seeking a motivated student with a background in data structures; machine learning/AI; and data analysis science for our summer research project.

32929,mechanism of action of Srcap mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders,Srcap is the ATPase subunit of a chromatin remodelling complex whose activity is mainly restricted to the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes thus regulating gene expression. However; Srcap can regulate transcription also through the recruitment of Crab binding protein (Cbp) and DNA methylation machinery. Numerous mutations have been identified in Srcap in patients suffering from different neurodevelopmental disorders including autism; floating harbor syndrome; and schizophrenia. Yet; how different mutations in the same protein cause different diseases has not been addressed. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) carrying different mutations of Srcap. The selected mutations impact 3 different protein domain; hence we expect different outcomes. We will investigate how different Srcap mutations affect the protein ability to: - Incorporate H2A.Z into nucleosomes - Recruit Cbp -induce changes in DNA methylation Specifically; we will use CUT&Tag; a variation of ChIP-sequencing; to screen for H2A.Z deposition and Cbp recruitment. This approach will allow us not only to investigate if there is an impairment in these mechanisms but also to screen which genes/genomic loci are affected. We will use Methyl-seq to screen for changes in DNA methylation. These tests will be followed by RNA-sequencing to profile how impairment in Srcap functions affects gene expression. We will then differentiate hIPSC in neurons and repeat the same screening to understand how Srcap mutations can cause neurodevelopmental disorders.,gildastefanelli,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-06-03,Background in cell culture and sterile techniques is a plus but not required.

32931,Spinal Cord Damage Modeling,Traumatic spinal cord injuries are severe injuries. While they are not the most frequent injuries; they are amongst the most debilitating and they lead to drastic changes in patients’ independence and quality of life. The spinal cord is a difficult structure to test mechanically due to its anatomical complexity; its softness; anisotropy and viscosity and the fact that it quickly degenerates after death. Finite element modeling has been used in the recent years to advance our knowledge on the biomechanical behaviour of the spinal cord. However; there is still no accepted injury criteria; i.e. a parameter able to discriminate between a not-injurious and an injurious mechanical load for the spinal cord. This limits our ability to assess neurological deficits probability using numerical simulations. In our research group; we have developed a simplified model of the spinal cord including different structures of the central nervous system (cerebrospinal fluid; spinal cord; pia mater and dura mater) showing good results in contusion. However; to our knowledge no paper has been published to propose a damage model for the spinal cord. Not including damage models in dynamic and traumatic simulations restricts the model validity range to spinal cord deformation remaining under the damage threshold which significantly limits its context of use. Furthermore; since the spinal cord is an extremely soft structure; not including damage model may lead to numerical instabilities. That is why the present project proposes to include damage simulation in a previously developed simplified spinal cord model. Repercussions of this project include improvement of numerical modeling of spinal cord injury which will enable to better understand the injury mechanisms of spinal cord injury and ultimately to improve patients’ treatments and patients’ injury assessment using personalized models.,Marie-HélèneBeauséjour,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The student must be part of a mechanical or biomedical engineering program or a similar program.

32932,Positive psychology in consumer behaviour: Fostering positive emotions and strong relationships in the marketplace,I am seeking a student to help with a variety of research-related projects over the summer; with one "core" project; described below. In many of my experiments; I ask people to try to find something that amuses them or makes them happy every day and to take a picture of it. I initially collected these images just to make sure participants did the task as instructed. But now; I am looking for a student who is interested in learning image analysis techniques to help me analyze these photos. Knowing what type of stimuli elicit emotions is important for understanding the role an emotion (like amusement) plays in our lives. Prior research on amusement has largely shown participants images; and asked them to classify the images as humorous or not. Although this technique allows us to get a basic idea of what types of stimuli elicit humor; it is constrained by the images the researchers decide to display. For (ridiculous) example; it's possible that everyone finds lemons hilarious; but researchers have never shown participants a photo of a lemon. It is therefore more powerful to allow participants to generate their own content; and annotate it. The student and I will work together to learn machine learning techniques for semi-supervised image classification. We will have help of a co-author who specializes in these techniques. Most of the students time will be taken up learning these image analysis techniques and applying them to my data. However; other research needs may arise during the summer. These would be for my other projects in the vein of consumer relationships and positive emotions. Smaller tasks could include: proofreading manuscripts (including double-checking statistics); hand-annotating text data; mocking up surveys in Qualtrics; and helping me collect data for in-person studies.,HollyHowe,Québec,HEC Montréal,English,2024-05-06,REQUIRED -- The student must have taken at least one statistics course; and must be comfortable interpreting statistical tests NICE-TO-HAVE -- Familiarity with a coding language like R or Python -- The student should be interested in developing machine learning skills; whether for a future academic or corporate career -- A student who has completed some RA work in a psychology or marketing lab in the past,Marketing
32933,Plant ecology and restoration of metal-contaminated wetlands in Sudbury, Ontario,Sudbury; Ontario is one of the world's largest metal mining centres; and historically has been the largest global point source of sulphur dioxide and metal particulate pollution from copper and nickel mining. We aim to develop novel restoration techniques to address the impacts of industrial contamination on peatlands. Peatlands are terrestrial wetlands that play a vital role in combatting global climate change by acting as long-term carbon sinks. Currently there are no methods for restoring metal-contaminated peatlands. This proposed research will contribute to novel restoration techniques with the larger goal of achieving net zero carbon within the region; and broadly in Canadian mining-impacted landscapes. The research project combines techniques and expertise in hydrology; biogeochemistry; plant; soil and microbial biology. This position is part of the plant biology research team led by Dr. Ellie Goud; and will determine impacts of metal contamination on plant growth and physiology in order to inform restoration trials. The 2024 field season from May – August will involve extensive field studies to measure plant physiological and morphological traits in key species in peatlands sites with increasing levels of metal and sulphur contamination. A major area of investigation involves understanding physiological thresholds and species interactions between the moss and shrub plant communities.,EllieGoud,Nova Scotia,St. Mary's University,English,2024-05-06,This is a field assistant position; and the student will be spending a lot of their time outdoors conducting field measurements.

32935,Plant responses to multiple interacting stressors: water-use traits as precursors to ecological transitions,One challenge that all terrestrial plants face is how to gain carbon for photosynthesis without losing too much water. This arises from the fact that as carbon dioxide diffuses into leaves; water vapor simultaneously diffuses out; resulting in a tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss. This tradeoff is a major evolutionary driver of plant diversity and adaptations to variable environments. The ability to tolerate a stress like water limitation can pre-adapt an organism to other stresses; possibly enabling transitions into new environments. This project will test hypotheses on the mechanisms underlying ecological shifts between water-limited and other harsh environments; including adaptations to acidity and salinity. Our study system is the Ericaceae (heath) family - a broadly diverse; globally distributed plant family ranging from parasitic herbs to large broad-leaf trees. Ericaceae species grow in tropical forests to arctic tundra; including extreme acidic; water-limited; and saline habitats. Ericaceae species are so often associated with stressful environments that a whole group of ecosystems are named after them: heathlands. Heathlands are characterized by multiple environmental stressors (acidic; nutrient-limited); and dominated by Ericaceae species (e.g.; heather; blueberries; rhododendrons). To test mechanisms that may have facilitated ecological shifts from water-limited to other harsh environments; we will conduct field surveys and measure plant traits related to water-use and other stress tolerances (e.g.; leaf and root morphology; chemistry; stable isotopes; gas exchange) in Ericaceae species from Nova Scotia heathlands that vary in moisture; soil texture (e.g.; sand; organic; rock); and chemistry (e.g.; pH; salinity; nutrients). Detailed soil measurements will link environmental variables to trait variation and identify potential shared mechanisms within a comparative phylogenetic context.,EllieGoud,Nova Scotia,St. Mary's University,English,2024-05-06,Training in specific field and lab skills will be provided for the student; including plant species identification; vegetation surveys; plant trait measurements; soil and water sampling; chemical extractions; and stable isotope analyses.

Field work experience; lab experience; or hobbies that involve outdoor activities are an asset. We are looking for someone who excited about ecological research; is capable of working in a team and independently; with strong organizational and time management skills.,
32936,Conversion of waste plastic,Canada has set a target to be net zero in carbon emissions by 2050. To achieve this target requires the development of multiple technologies that make the best use of the materials available. Millions of tonnes of waste plastic have accumulated in Canada. This waste is actually a resource that can be converted to hydrogen through thermo-chemical treatment. Small scale processes are needed for remote communities for whom the transportation of goods is expensive and where the environmental impact of waste and greenhouse gas emissions (i.e.; CO2) is most adverse. Instead of adding to a landfill; community plastic waste can be converted onsite to a clean; zero emission (at point of use) fuel hydrogen with the byproduct carbon used as an absorbent for water treatment or as a soil additive to enhance moisture retention. Two of the challenges with using waste material are the diversity of the composition (there are many different types of plastics that are discarded in different quantities week to week); and the impact of plastic additives. These additives flame retardants; pigments; antistatic agents; thermal stabilizers impart positive properties to the plastic and although present in small amounts (less than a few percent); they may negatively impact the conversion of the plastic. In this project appropriate catalysts will be developed; which will maximize the hydrogen yields and produce solid carbon with the desired properties.,JosephineHill,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,The student requires a strong knowledge of chemical engineering fundamentals including kinetics and thermodynamics; careful experimental skills with an attention to detail and proper safety requirements; good oral and written communication skills; an ability to critically assess results including those in the literature; and a passion for research.

32937,Urban Regeneration Revisited: Micro-scale Residential Neighborhood Rehabilitation in China,This research probes several research questions regarding the temporal and spatial patterns of micro-scale urban renewal and the interactions between local state and non-state interests in the micro-scale old residential neighborhood rehabilitation. (1) How has the ideology of sustainable urban renewal promoted by the central government been grounded on local old residential neighborhood rehabilitation? (2) How have the local state’s spatial selectivity strategy and the market logic in urban renewal imposed their influence on community engagement and socioeconomic sustainability in micro-scale old residential neighborhood rehabilitation? (3) How does the practice of micro-scale old residential neighborhood rehabilitation involve communities and residents; address property rights complexity; and serve local economic interests? The project will contribute to a systematic investigation of how China’s state-orchestrated old residential neighborhood rehabilitation under the rhetoric of micro-scale intervention; community empowerment; and urban sustainability has influenced residents’ socioeconomic circumstances; livelihood; and community wellbeing in residential neighborhood renewal. It will advance our understanding of the socioeconomic transformation processes and consequences of affected residents during and after the implementation of micro-scale old residential neighborhood rehabilitation. Theoretical insights and policy implications will be drawn regarding the main forces and consequences of state-orchestrated residential neighborhood rehabilitation and the effects of building stakeholder partnerships and advocating market integration on affected residents and local communities.,ZhuQian,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-05-01,The student should be able to conduct scholarly literature review and collect relevant media reports in both English and Chinese.

32938,Assessing Anti-Amyloid Compounds in a Mammalian Tissue Culture System,Cellular stress triggers the reversible formation of natural amyloid aggregates; which possess the same biophysical properties as the plaques observed in the brains of Alzheimer's; Parkinson's; and Huntington's disease patients (Audas; Developmental Cell; 2016). The only known regulator of this pathway is a family of noncoding RNA derived from the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (termed rIGSRNAs); a region of the genome traditionally viewed as transcriptionally silent junk DNA (Audas; Molecular Cell; 2016). Upon exposure to unfavorable growth conditions (e.g.; high temperature or acidosis); these noncoding RNA are induced and mediate a shift in the structure of a large family of cellular proteins; converting them from a native to amyloid state. Interestingly; the pathological Alzheimer’s beta-amyloid peptide can also convert to an amyloid conformation during this stress treatment; suggesting that these physiological and pathological aggregation pathways may be linked. The goal of this research project is to identify new cellular regulators of in vivo amyloid aggregation. A panel of targeted small molecules; which inhibit specific cellular proteins; have been recently found to possess anti-amyloid aggregation properties in our cellular setting. First; we will use fluorescence microscopy and the amyloidophilic dye Congo red to validate the efficiency of the small molecule on physiological aggregation. Second; we will explore the effects of positive compounds on the expression of the regulatory rIGSRNA transcripts; to determine if they are effecting the ncRNA regulatory axis.

32939,Federated learning in edge computing,In the traditional machine learning (ML) approach; data collected by local nodes is uploaded to data center and being processed centrally where formidable computational resource can be exploited. However; this approach is no longer suitable for edge computing networks. Firstly; users’ data is privacy sensitive than ever. Secondly; transferring data generated by large number of nodes for processing burdens the network and becomes the bottleneck of overall performance. Thirdly; the centric-fashion involves long propagation delay and incurs unacceptable latency; which is unbearable for many applications with instantaneous decision making. Therefore; with concerns mentioned above; a natural question rises: How to train a ML model from decentralized data at resource-constrained edge node? Federated Learning (FL) is a technique that fulfills this purpose. FL is a ML setting where many nodes collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of central server (e.g. service provider) while keeping training data decentralized. However; FL also faces challenges. One major challenge is system heterogeneity. FL involves the heterogeneous participants whose local dataset; computational ability; channel condition; power level and willingness to participate may vary with each other. Given the system heterogeneity; optimal strategy for resource allocation needs be developed to maximize the efficiency of FL. Another challenge is communication cost during global model training. Compared with traditional distributed machine learning; where several computational centers are involved; FL framework is usually related to large amount of edge nodes; incurring an extremely high communication cost. Therefore; effort on reducing communication cost (e.g.; model compression) is needed to improve the efficiency. In this project; we will focus on developing cutting edge FL techniques to address these challenges.,PingWang,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student is required to have some programming skill and have some background knowledge on machine learning algorithms.,
32940,Développement d’un engin d’exécution pour Discipulus, un langage d’exploitation de bases des données relationnelles,L’histoire des systèmes de gestion de bases de données (SGBD) a connu plusieurs développements depuis les années soixante. Le plus important est vraisemblablement l’établissement du modèle relationnel par Codd. Après plusieurs tentatives diverses; un langage s’est imposé : SQL [ISO 9075:2016]. Au fur et à mesure des normalisations successives et à la suite de l’intégration de l’objet dans les systèmes relationnels; la définition du langage s’est complexifiée au point qu’elle comprend désormais plusieurs milliers de pages; sans pour autant être complète). Plusieurs révisions de la norme ont été réalisées; des études ont tenté de la simplifier; mais l’envergure continue à être démesurée et rend hors de portée la connaissance exhaustive et l’utilisation pratique du langage en conformité avec la norme. La situation est encore plus complexe lorsqu’on considère le grand nombre de dialectes soutenus par les principaux éditeurs de SGBD (voir par exemple : Oracle; DB2; TeraData; Hana; MS-SQL; PostgreSQL; MySQL). En pratique; le transport des programmes SQL est une tâche couteuse et complexe. L’équipe de recherche a spécifié un nouveau langage; nommé Discipulus; fondé sur le modèle relationnel et qui évite les erreurs de SQL tout en se basant sur un système de typage fort et extensible afin de répondre aux exigences des nouvelles applications. Le projet consiste à développer un engin d’exécution pour Discipulus et mettre en place des essais pour évaluer son expressivité et sa complétude.,ChristinaKhnaisser,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,French,2024-05-06,Les connaissances et compétences sont un atout : Théorie relationnelle; Systèmes de bases de données relationnelles; Grammaires formelles; Compilation; Machines virtuelles.,
32941,Incorporating AI for Mobile 5G,Future generation wireless networks; i.e.; 5G and beyond; have to accommodate the surging growth of mobile data traffic and to support a high density of mobile users with a variety of services and applications. Meanwhile; the networks become increasingly dense; heterogeneous; decentralized; and ad hoc in nature; involving numerous and diverse network entities. As such; different objectives; e.g.; high throughput and low latency; need to be achieved in the service and resource allocation has to be designed and optimized accordingly. However; with the dynamics and uncertainty inherently existing in the wireless network environments; conventional approaches of service and resource management that require complete and perfect knowledge of the systems become inefficient or even inapplicable. Inspired by the success of machine learning in solving complicated control and decision-making problems; in this project; we focus on developing AI/machine learning-based approaches; which allow network entities to learn and build knowledge about the networks to make optimal decisions locally and independently.,PingWang,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student is required to have some programming skill and have some background knowledge on mobile communications and machine learning algorithms.,
32942,Évaluation et conception d’un pont en béton armé renforcé en cisaillement, une étude de cas,In North America; a large number of concrete bridges are affected by advanced degradation; particularly in Canada; where harsh climatic conditions accelerate this state of degradation due to temperature variations and the massive application of de-icing salts. Moreover; these structures are subjected to heavier loading; making it a major challenge to keep them in service safely. Maintaining these critical structures in service using rehabilitation techniques offers economic; ecological and social benefits. A number of bridges in Quebec and Canada have been shear strengthened with reinforcing bars inserted and anchored within the concrete structural sections. However; lack of knowledge about the specific behavior damaged bridged strengthened in shear can lead to inadequate and unsafe strengthening. The aim of this project is therefore to study the effect of a bridge's deterioration state on its shear resistance and on the rehabilitation method studied. The project is multi-faceted (prototyping; laboratory testing; computer modeling and analysis; structural design and verification) and can be tailored to suit the interests and skills of the applicants.,MathieuFiset,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-13,- Initiative; - Self-starter; - Creative; - Rigorous; - Basic knowledge of reinforced concrete structures; - Basic knowledge of structural analysis; design and modeling an asset.,
32945,Uncertainty-Awareness in Autonomous Driving,Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly becoming adopted and continue to be deployed in highly urban and uncertain environments. Uncertainty is present everywhere on our roads; whether it comes from multimodality in an agent’s potential future motion or measurement uncertainty from onboard sensors. Despite this; most AVs today operate agnostic to this inherent uncertainty; even though some modules of their own software stack can provide highly uncertain outputs depending on the scenario. To improve the safety and robustness of AVs as they continue to be adopted in more challenging environments; we need to develop autonomy stacks that are uncertainty-aware and can use such information to better inform the various components ultimately driving the AV. Towards this end there are several potential projects that include: investigating the role of uncertainty propagation in downstream tasks like planning; designing uncertainty-aware motion planners with safety guarantees; exploring alternative methods of uncertainty propagation and uncertainty estimation in perception and prediction; investigating methods for incorporating risk-awareness in perception; prediction; and/or planning; formulating and investigating different output representations for perception and prediction; investigating ways of making perception models adapt to new; unseen; and uncertain environments; exploring different methods for measuring performance of perception; prediction; planning; and control methods; exploring speed versus accuracy tradeoffs for deep learning models; and accelerating data delivery during deep learning model training. Through working on the project; the student will gain valuable experience in training neural networks and implementing novel deep learning pipelines and would eventually write and submit their work at a top-tier AI/Robotics conference or workshop (CVPR; NeurIPS; ICRA; etc).,IgorGilitschenski,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-06,Familiarity with popular deep neural architectures (CNNs; LSTMs; Transformers; etc).

32946,Self-supervised representation learning for event-based vision,Event-based cameras have recently gained significant interest in computer vision due to their high temporal resolution; low energy consumption; and high dynamic range properties. Event-based vision has shown promising results in a variety of applications; such as object recognition; detection; tracking; depth; and optical flow estimation. However; this novel imaging modality poses unique challenges; including the need for specialized models to handle the asynchronous nature of events; and the lack of large-scale datasets. In RGB computer vision; scaling up datasets and model sizes has led to the recent breakthrough in vision foundation models. These models demonstrate strong performance and generalizability over different domains. However; we cannot replicate such success in event-based vision due to the lack of labeled datasets. Instead; we seek to train good models with self-supervised representation learning (SSRL). Through SSRL; we can learn useful event data representations; which serve as a good starting point for data-efficient fine-tuning in any downstream tasks. We might borrow ideas from SSRL in RGB images and 3D point clouds; and add event-specific designs to fit in our data. Through working on the project; the student will gain valuable experience in training neural networks and implementing novel deep learning pipelines and would eventually write and submit their work at a top-tier AI/Robotics conference or workshop (CVPR; NeurIPS; ICRA; etc).,IgorGilitschenski,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-06,Familiarity with popular deep neural architectures (CNNs; LSTMs; Transformers; etc); and computer vision tasks (detection; segmentation; etc). Previous experience with event-based vision is preferred but not necessary.,
32947,Medical technology innovation, design and development: a methodological perspective,Canadian society; like most Western societies; is facing a significant population ageing. The resulting increase in the proportion of elderly people will have major repercussions on healthcare systems; which are already facing numerous challenges such as labor shortage. A number of hospitals are counting on the deployment of new technologies to address some of these issues. In parallel; this has been mirrored by major developments in medical technologies (medtech). However; the development of innovative medtech is complex. First; from a technical and organizational perspective; the medtechs of interest in this project are multidisciplinary products integrating mechanics; electronics; electricity; software and connectivity. On top of this; regulatory aspects must be taken into account; particularly for medical products/devices requiring approval from Health Canada; or the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. The business environment is also highly competitive; with "aggressive" intellectual property strategies. Legal aspects can also be raised in relation to data collection and recently adopted laws. The research project focuses on the development of innovative and intelligent medtech from a methodological perspective (approaches; processes; methods and tools). Indeed; there seems to be limited scientific literature on the development of "intelligent" medtech. The aim of the project is therefore to conduct a literature review on the development of innovative medical technologies; in order to identify the main approaches; processes; methods and tools discussed by the scientific community.,JuliaGuérineau,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-06-26,Students with a genuine interest in innovation and the application of technology to healthcare. Ideally; students should have some knowledge of product development/design; and a keen interest in the question of "how to develop healthcare innovation efficiently?". The question will be approached from a theoretical angle. The student is expected to be autonomous (weekly meetings); to be able to conduct a literature review and to have excellent synthesis skills.,
32948,Adapting data from diverse robotic embodiments for fast robot learning,Massive datasets (such as the combined text of most internet websites) have enabled impressive breakthroughs in approaches such as language modeling in the last year. In robotics; however; obtaining data is often expensive and slow; and existing data is tied to specific robotic hardware (often called the embodiment). In this project; we want to solve this problem by understanding how data gathered from different robotic embodiments can be used to speed up learning for a new robot in a new environment. The core goal (and challenge) is to learn dynamics models or imitation policies from existing data and transferring those to a brand new situation. Data from other embodiments can take many forms; so the concrete challenges involved in each instance can be diverse. For example; one robot might have a fully articulated hand; while another robot might only have a pincer gripper; but both are mounted to the same arm. In this case; some of the important aspects of motion; such as how to approach an object for manipulation; are shared; others; like what kind of grasp to attempt; are very different. Automatically detecting these differences in embodiment and deciding what aspect of the data to transfer to a new embodiment are the two core challenges in the project. In this project; students have the opportunity to work on one of the most challenging and exciting problems in robot learning. We expect that a successful project can be submitted to a top venue in machine learning or robotics such as ICRA; RSS; or CORL. Students will also become familiar with important tools of robot learning; such as common simulators.,IgorGilitschenski,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-06,Required: - Strong programming skills in Python - Close familiarity with software engineering tools such as IDEs; remote ssh; and Git - Familiarity with machine learning such as can be obtained from introductory courses in the field Bonus/nice to have - Familiarity with reinforcement and imitation learning - Familiarity with robotics and especially simulators such as mujoco or pybullet,Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematics
32949,Creating an online and collaborative database for the representation of processes, methods and tools for product development,The growth of digital and connectivity technologies within the industrial landscape; and their integration within products; has led to the emergence of "multidisciplinary" products that combine mechanical; electrical; electronic; software and; more broadly; information and communication technologies. These multidisciplinary products are more complex; from both a technical and an organizational perspective. For companies wishing to evolve their "traditional" product ranges towards multidisciplinary products; it can represent a major challenge. To support companies in this evolution; previous research has investigated the evolution of product development practices from a methodological standpoint. In particular; this work has led to the creation of "cartographies"; graphically organizing approaches; processes; methods and tools; and their links for multidisciplinary product development. Although these cartographies can be seen as a preliminary database; their main limitation is that they are a snapshot of the scientific literature. Given this static aspect; it is not possible; for example; to perform queries on these cartographies; to display certain branches; or to easily manipulate these data to generate other results. This research project addresses an important limitation identified in previous work. The idea of this project is therefore to explore different types of representation (ontology; graph-oriented database; other); in order to determine the most appropriate representation for the project and apply it by setting up a demonstrator (VOWL/Protected; GraphQL/Neo4J; etc.).,JuliaGuérineau,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-06-26,The ideal candidate is a student in software engineering/computer science wishing to apply his/her database skills to set up a demonstrator to dynamically represent research data (cartographies) in a web environment.

32950,Using photons to study fundamental issues in Quantum Physics,The study of Quantum Information has reinvigorated the effort to understand the fundamental concepts of Quantum Theory; such as measurement; the wavefunction; and entanglement. Photons are the ideal quantum particle with which to explore these concepts because we can manipulate them easily; with high precision; and at room temperature. We are exploring the use of generalized measurements (e.g. weak measurement) as practical tools in metrology; optics; and Quantum Information. This project will perform experiments and theory investigating how quickly we can extract information about the quantum wavefunction from an ensemble of identical particles.,JeffLundeen,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,The student should have taken an officially course in quantum physics for credit at their university. In particular; they should be familiar with how to do calculations using the Dirac's Bra and Ket formalism (i.e. ). Additionally; some familiarity with optics; programming; and laboratory experience would be beneficial but are not necessary.,
32951,Development of a Mechatronic System for Microrobotic Swarm Position Control,The capability to directly interrogate intracellular structures inside a single cell for measurement and manipulation is important for understanding subcellular and sub-organelle activities; diagnosing diseases; and developing new therapeutic approaches. However; the measurements for intracellular structures are under-explored due to the lack of measurement instruments. Magnetic nanoparticles; especially a swarm of nanoparticles; can be controlled by magnetic force and to access small spaces for measurement. To achieve intracellular physical measurement using nanoparticles; this project aims to develop a mechatronic system for controlling the position of a magnetic nanoparticle swarm. The system will include visual servo control to achieve sub-micrometer position control accuracy and incorporate a magnetic force model to achieve pico-newton force control. With the developed system; the magnetic nanoparticles will be controlled three-dimensionally to form a swarm and positioned in the cell for performing the mechanical measurement. The ultimate goal of my research is to deploy the robotic technologies in clinical settings to expand treatment options for patients with tumors. My research program will involve topics including microrobotics; medical imaging; computer vision; instrumentation; nanotechnology; and tumor mechanobiology.,XianWang,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-01,The ideal candidate for this position should have a background in mechatronic system design; as candidates with such experience will be given preference. The student will be collaborating closely with graduate students within the lab; so strong teamwork and communication skills are essential. In terms of technical proficiency; experience with CAD tools; C programming; and circuit design would be advantageous. At the commencement of the research project; on-site safety training and software tutorials will be provided to ensure a smooth start.,Engineering; Engg-Mechanical; Engg-Electrical
32952,Experimental study of mass timber connections,Mass timber has been recognized as a sustainable and efficient building solution; and it is the driving force behind the fast growth of timber industry globally. One key component in a mass timber building system is the connection between timber elements or between timber and other elements. The connection design is complicated by the heterogeneity of wood and different layouts in various engineered wood products. The energy dissipation capacity of the building under earthquakes is largely depended upon connections. The connection design also impacts the building cost and the aesthetic expression of wood; both of which are critical concerns for architects. The Timber Engineering Group at UBC has been working on modern timber building systems for decades; and this short-term experimental project is part of our ongoing research and innovation in this field. The project will focus on low-yield-steel based energy dissipating connections for mass timber. Mass timber elements often have high in-plane rigidity thus little internal energy dissipating capacity. We have conducted some studies on the low yield steel energy dissipaters for CLT walls/modules. In this project; the student will work with our researchers to find ways to optimize the design; and then investigate the performance of the new design through experiments. The results will be analyzed and compared with existing models. This project offers the student opportunities to develop critical skills in research and engineering application; as well as to interact with colleagues from various disciplines and cultural backgrounds. In the long term; the outcome of this project will help engineers to develop innovative and reliable building solutions.,FrankLam,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-20,The student is expected to have good background in structural engineering; mechanics; or wood science.

32953,Pipeflow Manipulation for Emissions Reduction,This project focuses on pipeflow dynamics and manipulation towards lowering drag and heat losses in the flow. Energy of the fluid in turbulent flows is concentrated in particular coherent structures that belong to specific Fourier modes. This enables flow manipulation to retain energy in specific structures and dissipate it in others; which leads to lower drag and higher efficiency in heat and fluid transport.This constitutes an intrusive mechanism to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in transportation of energy products; including liquids; gases and multiphase fluids.,ArmanHemmati,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,No skills available,Engg-Mechanical
32954,Visualizing and understanding biosynthetic enzymes,Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are megaenzymes that resemble molecular assembly lines. There are hundreds of thousands of NRPSs found in nature; many producing compounds that are currently-used therapeutics; and many others producing uncharacterized compounds that could be next-generation therapeutics. Furthermore; characterized NRPSs could be bioengineered to make novel therapeutics. For the past two decades; bioengineering efforts have mostly resulted in failures or drastically reduced yields. One major reason for this failure is that naïve bioengineering likely disrupts the many transient domain-domain interactions and dramatic three-dimensional flexibility NRPSs display during their synthetic cycle. Each NRPS consists of multiple so-called modules; made of a set of domains that together are responsible for the incorporation of a single building block into the nascent peptide chain. During this catalytic process; many distinct conformational states are necessary; and therefore not surprising that any bioengineering change made to the NRPS assembly line guided by genetic or biochemical information alone is very likely to perturb the spatial interactions necessary for catalysis. Consequently; high-resolution structural data for the different catalytic conformations is necessary to potentiate bioengineering. Structure-guided approaches could allow us to develop a biosynthetic toolbox of designed NRPS assembly lines with modifications such as insertion of tailoring domains; domain swaps; and active site surgeries that could make it possible to synthesize high-value compounds or generate new-to-nature compounds by rational design or genetic library screens. In this MITACS project; the student will work with a senior Schmeing lab member in a multi-disciplinary approach to purify; characterize; visualize and bioengineer NRPS megaenzymes.,MartinSchmeing,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-01,Basic molecular biology skills Experience in working with proteins or structural biology is a plus,
32955,Nanobubbles: Generation and characterization,A major limitation that has restricted the use of nanobubbles to this point has been challenges with their efficient generation; e.g. high-energy costs; modest concentrations and lack of scalability. This research project will build upon a recently published revolutionary technology where electric fields are used to catalyze nanobubble generation. This novel approach requires ~1000-fold less energy compared to current methods; thereby overcoming the crucial limitation that has thus far restricted the potential impacts and widespread application of nanobubbles. A principal goal of this project is to identify key factors that affect the performance characteristics of the generator and the scalability of the design; and to characterize the nanobubble solutions produced (e.g. nanobubble size and concentration).,SusanaKimura-Hara,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-06-03,This project requires two highly enthusiastic and self-motivated students with background in 1) engineering and familiar with prototyping and design and 2) chemistry/material science that has taken analytical chemistry courses; has wet laboratory experience (prepare solutions; analytical balance; pH meter); and familiar with a range of instruments.

32956,Water reuse: formation of disinfection byproducts from recycled waters,Water disinfection; one of the most important human health developments of the 20th century; is used in water treatment to protect against waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid. However; chemical (e.g.; chlorine) and ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection processes react with natural organic matter; present in rivers and lakes; to unintentionally form disinfection by-products (DBPs) that may cause adverse health effects by long-term exposure. Population growth; climate change; and increasing water demands by economic activities are jeopardizing the quality of water supplies leading to the use of waters with higher anthropogenic inputs (i.e. organic nitrogen; industrial solvents) in developed and undeveloped countries. The ability to continue to provide safe water under this constant change becomes challenging; because of the increased complexity of source waters and the multiple reactions and compounds that are produced from disinfection. Typically; wastewater effluents are treated through various physical-chemical processes including microfiltration; reverse osmosis; or advanced oxidation processes (i.e.; UV/hydrogen peroxide) to remove contaminants and inactivate microbial pathogens for potable reuse. Wastewater effluents contain high levels of ammonia and organic ammonia that are not well removed from these processes and can react with disinfectants to produce toxic DBPs. This study evaluates the formation of halogenated organic amines by reacting model organic compounds with disinfectants and identify intermediate and products using advanced mass spectrometry instrumentation (liquid and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry). Ultimately we want to evaluate the role that halogenated organic amines haves on the formation of toxic DBPs.,SusanaKimura-Hara,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-06-03,This research requires a highly enthusiastic and self-motivated student with background in analytical chemistry; water chemistry; organic chemistry; and/or engineering. Student must be proficient in English; and Microsoft Office software including Excel and Word. The prospective student should have good laboratory and analytical skills. The student should be detail-oriented and well-organized. Wet laboratory experience is required for this project (i.e.; prepare solutions; use analytical balance and pH meter). Student with knowledge and/or experience on gas chromatography mass spectrometry is highly desirable.,
32957,From control theory to physics and back again,My projects are for a physics student seeking to learn about control and information and thermodynamics or for engineering students with an introduction to control theory who want to learn more. The project will be original research – publishable if it works out well enough – that touches on the interplay between physics and control. This project will focus on the continuing development of both hardware and control algorithms for the classic “cart-pendulum” system (try to swing up and then balance upside down a pendulum attached to a cart by pushing it back and forth along a rail). This classic problem requires solving many hard control problems; including nonlinearity; and is a good way to evaluate novel control algorithms. We have been exploring new algorithms to increase the robustness of the control. How can a system recover from big perturbations; even when its dynamics are poorly known? Although the cart-pendulum is a “toy” system; it plays a role analogous to the harmonic oscillator in standard physics courses. Master it and so many other things become understandable (or controllable!). I have posted two positions; with the idea that one person can focus on hardware and the other on software / implementation and testing of new algorithms. Previous students have made some progress on these; but there is much to do. We would like to simplify existing hardware designs and also increase the sophistication of the software; including exploring ways to parallelize calculations (e.g.; with GPUs). So whether you like building things or playing with theory and whether you come from Engineering or from Physics; there is a place for you!,JohnBechhoefer,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-06,A perfect background would include courses in control theory; linear systems theory; statistical physics; and a bit of machine learning. You should also have good programming skills in some language (Matlab; LabVIEW; Mathematica; C; Python; or something similar). Some basic lab skills (elementary circuits; data acquisition using DAQs) would also be desirable. No one knows all this! So I will be looking for people with some of the background and – most important – who are enthusiastic and can learn quickly. You should want to know WHY and not be content to just “use formulas.”,Physics; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Computer
32958,First-principles nuclear theory for neutrino and dark-matter physics (Supervision will primarily be provided by Dr. Jason D. Holt, and the work is planned to take place on-site at TRIUMF, Canada’s particle accelerator centre, which is located at the south end of the UBC-Vancouver campus),What is the mass of the neutrino? What are the limits of matter? How and where are the heavy elements created? How do stars die? Can we detect dark matter? As science probes ever more extreme facets of the universe; the role of nuclear theory in confronting such fundamental questions in nature continues to deepen. Long considered a phenomenological discipline; advances in many-body methods together with our understanding and treatment of nuclear forces are transforming nuclear theory into a true first-principles pursuit. And with this shift; we are now in a position to provide reliable predictions to address the questions above and connect observations made in the laboratory to the underlying strong interactions governing the properties of nuclei. This project will focus on the development and application of powerful theoretical methods to explore fundamental questions on the structure of exotic nuclei; or more far-reaching connections to neutrino or dark-matter physics; neutron star physics; or searches for symmetry violation in nature. The student will first gain familiarity and build confidence working with the basic ingredients of such calculations: nuclear forces and their connection to the underlying theory of strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics); and nuclear many-body methods to predict properties of medium-mass nuclei. Depending on particular interests; the student will have the exciting opportunity either to design and implement an extension to the existing computational infrastructure; work on computationally optimizing existing codes; or perform a series of calculations which will confront directly with experiments being performed at TRIUMF or other prominent experimental facilities across the world.,OliverStelzer-Chilton,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,With the latest advances in high-performance computing and optimization algorithms at her/his disposal; the student will gain experience with parallel-computing techniques such as OpenMP or MPI and work on some of the world’s largest supercomputers. The ideal applicant will have mastered material encountered in introductory quantum mechanics courses and be familiar with concepts such as eigenvalues; wavefunctions; operators; unitary transformations; and angular-momentum algebra. Furthermore; some computing experience is required; with competency in Python and some experience with C++ would be helpful.,Computer Science; Physics
32959,Searching for the nearest transiting Earth-like exoplanets,The Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS); is addressing Kepler's shortcoming by observing the entire sky; albeit only the brighter stars. TESS-discovered exoplanets are around brighter and nearer host stars; and so offer more in-depth information on the diversity of exoplanets. However; TESS' limited sensitivity to faint stars means that what may be the most common type of stellar type hosting a rocky planetary system; the M dwarfs; are under-represented in TESS discoveries. At the same time; M-planetary systems may offer the best opportunity for characterizing any Earth-like rocky planets. The habitable zones of M dwarfs are much narrower; corresponding to orbital periods of months or less. And the planet-to-star contrast is very favourable for a direct detection of any exoplanetary atmosphere through transit or eclipse spectroscopy. Prof. Metchev's team at Western University if involved in the planning for a space telescope mission that will be in part dedicated to discovering rocky planets around M-type or cooler dwarf stars. The Photometric Observations of Extrasolar Transits (POET) is a mission proposed to the Canadian Space Agency that will spend up to a year on a survey of the nearest and coolest candidate rocky planet hosts. Any discoveries from POET will be prime targets for atmospheric spectroscopy with JWST; possibly even in search for atmospheric biosignature gasses. In preparation for POET; Prof. Metchev's team is assembling a catalogue of the nearest M-type or cooler (L or T types) stars; analyzing their properties from TESS observations or with ground-based telescopes; and prioritizing them for the POET target sample. Potential follow-up observations are also possible with an array of three 50 cm robotic telescopes in use by Prof. Metchev's group.,StanimirMetchev,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-05-06,The successful applicant will have strong computing skills; including knowledge of the Linux operating system and of a scripting/programming language (python; C).

Having enough data (2D images of a scene with ground truth camera poses); NeRFs are able to generate high-quality novel views of the scene. Although a whole line of research is dedicated to making NeRFs faster; less data-hungry; and more performant; scene manipulation in NeRFs is still an important and much less explored problem. In this project; we will explore how NeRFs can be trained in a way that allows modifying a scene such as for moving objects; changing their appearance; or inpainting new / removing existing objects in a NeRF.,IgorGilitschenski,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,1.

32961,Ferrofluidic Platform for Mechanical Measurement in Tissue,From magnetic tweezers to robotic magnetic-field generation systems; the development of magnetic micromanipulation systems; using electromagnets or permanent magnets; has enabled a multitude of applications for cellular and intracellular measurement and stimulation. Controlled by different configurations of magnetic-field generation systems; magnetic particles have been actuated by an external magnetic field to exert forces/torques and perform mechanical measurements on the cell membrane; cytoplasm; cytoskeleton; nucleus; intracellular motors; etc. The particles have also been controlled to generate aggregations to trigger cell signaling pathways and produce heat to cause cancer cell apoptosis for tumor hyperthermia treatment.

32963,DEVELOPMENTAL EPIGENETICS,Epigenetic modifications are small chemical tags that can be added directly to DNA; or on histones that package DNA within chromosomes. These various modifications provide means by which a genetic sequence may be functionally active or inactive at a specific time during cell development; without altering the DNA sequence. During early development; embryonic cells divide and grow according to a program of their own; driven by a major overhaul of epigenetic modifications. We believe that any interference occurring during the establishment of this embryonic epigenetic program may increase the vulnerability to deploy various developmental disorders. The project aims to identify the interdependence that exists between epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression; as well as their susceptibilities to permanent disruption following errors in the embryonic program. We use an innovative embryonic stem cell model in which the expression of an epigenetic enzyme responsible for DNA methylation can be controlled. We will define at high resolution the chronology and evolution of epigenetic disruption in embryonic cells. Beyond standard techniques in molecular biology; sequencing approaches (Methyl-Seq; ChIP-Seq) coupled with bioinformatic analyzes will be exploited to establish detailed signatures for the DNA methylation and histone modifications. Under the guidance of a senior Postdoc; the student will participate in various aspects (experiments; analyses) of this project. By finely dissecting the epigenetic dysregulation mechanisms in embryonic stem cells; we aim to identify which epigenetic modifications are likely to be dysregulated in early embryos and how this could lead to adverse development. In this project; we also aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms implicated in the dysregulation of epigenetic patterns during early embryo development and during neural cell lineage specification resulting from the dysfunction of specific epigenetic modifying enzymes.,SergeMcGraw,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,Our team is looking for students with a self-driven personality who are eager to learn!

32964,Identification et caractérisation de microorganismes responsables de produits laitiers atypiques ou non conformes,The presence of spoilage bacteria and pathogens is a potential issue in the dairy industry; especially when these microorganisms modify the products by making them atypical or non-compliant. The source of these microorganisms is often unknown; for example milk; equipment; workers; or the presence of biofilm. Dairy biofilms are a complex microbial ecosystem that can include spoilage microorganisms or pathogens. As part of this internship project; samples will be purchased from local grocery stores to challenge them with different quality maintenance tests. IT management will be necessary to orchestrate everything. Subsequently; the potential microorganism in question will be identified by various conventional microbiological methods and by using sequencing or mass spectrometry methods. After its isolation; the microorganism will be characterized (Gram; antibiotic resistance; etc.). In addition; its ability to form biofilms will also be evaluated; and various chemical formulations will be tested in order to better control this microorganism. The antimicrobial effect will be assessed by various analytical methods (e.g.; absorbance measurement; bacterial counting on selective agars; and electron and/or confocal microscopy). The results obtained during this internship will be decisive since they will make it possible to expand the collection of microorganisms responsible for atypical or non-compliant products. Ultimately; this collection will speed up the identification process if a similar problem arises in industry.,JulieJean,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-06,The successful candidate must have a BSc degree in microbiology; molecular biology; food science or other related disciplines.

32965,Editing the Epigenome,Epigenetic modifications are small chemical tags which can be added directly on DNA; or on histones that package DNA within chromosomes. These various modifications provide means by which a genetic sequence may be functionally active or inactive at a specific time during cell development; without altering the DNA sequence. During early development; embryonic cells divide and grow according to a program of their own; driven by a major overhaul of epigenetic modifications. We believe that any interference occurring during the establishment of this embryonic epigenetic program may increase the vulnerability to deploy various developmental disorders. Through unknown mechanisms; parent-of-origin-specific methylation marks on one allele of imprinted genes are able to escape the embryonic reprogramming wave occurring during the first week of development and retain their profiles via DNA methylation maintenance activity. Failing to maintain proper genomic imprinting patterns during the embryonic reprogramming leads to various abnormal developmental delay. What remains to be elucidated is whether we can permanently re-establish normal profiles of DNA methylation and subsequent gene expression of imprinted (allele-specific) sequences following the loss of their DNA methylation imprinting status. To set the foundation for a clear understanding of the mechanisms behind re-establishing the loss of inherited methylation profiles; we hypothesize that we can re-establish specifically and permanently the lost DNA methylation imprints at specific loci by targeted epigenome editing in embryonic cells. Under the guidance of a senior PhD student; the MITACS intern will use a CRISPR epigenome editing system to add or remove site specific DNA methylation marks on imprinted regions in a model of embryonic stem cells; and define if we can properly re-establish DNA methylation imprints and associated gene expression following their dysregulation.,SergeMcGraw,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,Our team is looking for students with a self-driven personality who are eager to learn!

32967,Improving Product Allocation in Warehouses through Content-Based Filtering,This research project aims to investigate the application of the machine learning technique content-based filtering in warehouse management to solve a Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP). The goal is to identify the best storage location for each product based on its properties to minimize order picking time. This research project is divided into three main stages: (1) Conduct a literature review to understand the current state of the application of recommendation algorithms in warehouse management; (2) Identify relevant product characteristics influencing products’ allocation; such as size; weight; category; and expiration date; (3) Develop a content-based filtering model based on these characteristics to recommend the best location for each product within the warehouse. The proposed model will be implemented in a simulated storage environment; using accurate product data and considering available space restrictions. Experiments will be conducted to evaluate the model's effectiveness in terms of operational efficiency; search time and recommendation accuracy. Results will be compared to traditional methods of product allocation in warehouses; such as the rule-based approach.

32968,AM process sustainability prediction using machine learning,The increasing pressure of resource reservation has forced the rethinking of sustainable development in manufacturing. Additive manufacturing (AM) has been believed to be a green process because of its high material efficiency; shortened supply chain; and decentralized production. To further improve the process for elevated sustainability; there is a strong need to quantitatively model the AM process regarding its sustainable performance. In my research group; we have developed a lifecycle assessment (LCA) model to evaluate the sustainable performance of plastic AM process. However; this process requires strong background of LCA modeling and it creates barriers for designers without such a background to examine the environmental impacts in product design stage. In this regard; a machine learning model has been proposed to automate the process. The proposed project aims to further optimize the machine learning model for better accuracy and experimental validation as well as developing an optimization model for process parameter recommendation for AM process. The proposed project aims to develop a novel computational design method that is able to use “in-the-wild” images taken by mobile phones (with two or more cameras) as the input for custom-fit modeling. An “in-the-wild” image means that a photo is taken under no environmental constraints in terms of lighting; backgrounds; etc. This approach will largely relax the need for expensive 3D capturing devices. Once the digital product model is computationally generated; optimization of the digital model for better performance and printability for AM will also be investigated. Potential custom-fit products to be examined could be earphones; footwear; and wearable devices for medical treatment.,ShengYang,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-06-03,The ideal student would be having a background on product design; manufacturing; lifecycle assessment; math; or similar fields.

32970,ILIVE : Development of immersive virtual environments for inclusive leisure activities,Leisure activities are less accessible for people with autism and their families; resulting in reduced community presence and social participation. This observation led our research team; drawn from engineering (ÉTS); educational sciences (UQAM) and the community; to develop new innovative immersive and inclusive activities for people with autism. The CAVE system has been chosen to develop virtual reality leisure activities that will help foster social participation and improve social skills. This will promote better interaction between autistic and non-autistic people and encourage participation in different settings and communities across Quebec. With this in mind; a new prototype of a multi-purpose CAVE (adaptable and transportable) is being developed in the laboratory. This development also involves defining the leisure activities that will be relevant in meeting the challenges of inclusion and immersion; as well as the virtual environments that will be designed. This interdisciplinary project will focus on three axes: 1) updating the literature and collaborating on identifying the technological elements that make up the CAVE; 2) collaborating on drawing up the specifications and applying them to the design of the virtual environment that can be adapted to any CAVE surface; 3) collaborating on developing immersive and interactive scenario(s).

In this project; we will accelerate big data applications—with a major focus on big data queries and sparse matrix based computations—on datacenter FPGAs; to achieve better performance and energy-efficiency. This will be based on our strong record in accelerating big data applications such as computational genomics (e.g.; MEMSYS 2017 best paper and ISPASS 2018 best paper nominee) and machine learning (TCAD 2019 Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Award). In addition; our team developed the first open-source compiler SQL2FPGA (FCCM 2023) that compiles Apache Spark SQL queries (state-of-the-art big data computing system) onto the FPGA accelerators.

32975,Spin manipulation and imaging for ultra-cold gas dynamics,This project will create novel potentials in which to study the dynamics of ultra-cold atoms. Complicated optical patterns will be created by manipulating laser light with spatial light modulators. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields of a laser can alter the energy and polarization in atoms. These perturbations affect interactions between atoms; through electromagnetic forces and quantum mechanical exchange symmetries. By tuning the frequency; intensity; polarization; and; most importantly; spatial distribution of laser light; a host of interesting new dynamical behaviors can be observed in ultra-cold gases; including spin waves; magnetic instabilities; and long-range ordering in magnetic domains. The focus of this project will be working with a spatial light modulator to create novel spatial and time-dependent optical profiles for manipulating a quantum gas; and also to perform simulations and analysis of atomic dynamics. Both computational and experimental techniques will be used for this project.

In this project; we will accelerate deep learning applications—with a major focus on low-bit CNNs and transformer-based models—on edge devices with hardware/software codesign techniques to achieve better performance and energy-efficiency. This will be based on our strong record in accelerating deep learning models such as CNNs (TCAD 2019 Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Award; FPGA 2022); SNNs (FPL 2021; TRETS 2022); and Vision Transformers (HPCA 2023).

32979,Nanoparticles in Blue Phase Liquid Crystals,Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are an omnipresent in our lives but new LC based devices are constantly being developed; such as smart windows or miniature lenses for endoscopes. Combining inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) with LCs can both enhance the LC response to external stimuli and allow for reversible variation of the NP spatial distributions and their associated optical; electronic or magnetic properties. Blue Phase liquid crystals (BPLCs) are fascinating materials both on a fundamental level and for applications. They are unique liquid crystals due to their cubic structures and very fast response times to electrical fields. Ultrafast BPLC displays have been developed but BPLCs also have applications in the field of photonics. BPLCs; with lattice parameters on order of visible light wavelengths; are natural photonic crystals with optical bandgaps; analogous to electronic bandgap materials (semiconductors) but control the flow of light (photons) rather than electrons. BPLC can also template NPs into ordered; dynamic assemblies. We showed that gold NPs in BPLC spontaneously and reversibly form giant 3D cubic crystals (Gharbi; ACS nano; 2016 10; p3410) but fundamental questions remain regarding the mechanism. The effect of other types of nanoparticles will be explored in this project; specifically ferroelectric and magnetic NPs. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) will be applied to study the effect of the particle size; composition and shape on the NP spatial distribution and the thermal stability of the BPLC matrix.

32981,Deep Learning Techniques for Mining Customers' Sequential Purchase Patterns for E-Commerce Product Recommendation,Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) belong to a class of neural network that are designed to process sequential and time series data. Common RNN's architectures include long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). Such models considers historical information to predict the future outcome (e.g.; for example; analyzing words in a sentence and numbers in a series; customers' historical purchase records etc). The project requires developing a recommendation system using RNNs; such as LSTM or GRU; to mine sequential patterns from customers' historical records (user-product interaction data). The model is then trained to capture dependencies and extract sequential patterns in customers' behavior thereby enabling personalized recommendations based on users' past interactions.,Mahreen NasirButt,Ontario,Algoma University,English,2024-05-01,1. The student must be passionate in learning new skills and techniques to implement state of the art methods. 2. Experience with programming languages (e.g.; Python) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets. Experience with libraries such as scikit learn and Keras will be a plus. 3.

32982,Number-theoretic structure of the Clifford hierarchy,This project is centered around the Clifford hierarchy; a nested family of subsets of the unitary group. The Clifford hierarchy arises naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation and has been intensely studied over teh past two decades. Despite this sustained scrutiny; the structure of the Clifford hierarchy remains mysterious. The goal of this project is to apply to the study of the Clifford hierarchy newly developed number-theoretic techniques that have proven useful in the study of quantum circuits.,NeilRoss,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,The student taking part in this research project is expected to have a good understanding of basic tools and techniques from linear algebra; abstract algebra; and number theory. Some experience programming is also required. Knowledge of quantum computing is an asset but is not necessary as the relevant concepts can be acquired throughout the internship.,
32983,Restriction Monads,It is well known that monads in the bicategory Span(Set) correspond exactly to (small) categories. A restriction monad in a bicategory B to be a monad in B on an object A together with other 1-dimensional data on A and several linking 2-dimensional data that encode the notion of partiality in a way reminiscent of a restriction category. We know that the correspondence between small categories and monads in Span(Set) generalizes to a correspondence between small restriction categories and restriction monads in Span(Set). Similarly; small restriction categories correspond to so-called restriction monads in Set-Mat; a restriction module is a right action of a restriction category X on a set M so that each element m ∈ M is assigned an endomorphism m in X. Specific questions for this project are: 1) A restriction monad in Span(Set) is a small restriction category. This leads immediately to questioning how similar structures are related: Is an ordinary monad in rCat a restriction monad? Is an ordinary monad in Span(rCat) a restriction category? 2) The work of Cockett and Cruttwell introduces the data of a restriction tangent bundle; which gives a categorical model of differentiation in a suitable abstract setting. A tangent bundle is a restriction endofunctor equipped with some structure reminiscent of a structured comonad (in the appropriate setting). How much of the restriction structure can be moved into the comonad? 3) Partially invertible computation has been modeled recently by Giles using Cartesian inverse categories. What is the role that the Cartesian structure (or; more generally; a monoidal structure) plays in computation; and how does this model compare to a restriction monad on an inverse category?,DarienDeWolf,Nova Scotia,St. Francis Xavier University,English,2024-05-01,Ideally; a student should be actively studying mathematics or computer science; but all students with interest in these topics are welcome. There are some skills required for this project: Required: Knowledge of set theory and mathematical proof. Useful: Knowledge of abstract algebra (groups; rings; fields). Comfort with technical writing. Very useful: Knowledge of category theory; modules; and type theory.,
32984,Maximizing recovery of silver from recycling of anode slime from copper electrolysis cell,Silver (Ag) is used as an antibacterial agent in disinfecting medical devices; home appliances; and water treatment; as well as in dental alloys; solder and brazing alloys; electrical contacts; and batteries. Silver bullion is produced from the treatment of anode slime from the copper (Cu) electrolysis cell in two steps reduction smelting and oxidation converting; which will be further treated in downstream processes. The chemistry of the converting cycle can be simplified into the system Te-Pb-Cu-Se-Ag-O. The knowledge of the distribution behavior of Te; Pb; Cu; Se; and Ag between metal; slag; and gas is required under a set of process parameters (composition; temperature; and oxygen partial pressure) to minimize the Ag loss in slag and maximize its recovery in metal. However; there is a lack of systematic study on the thermodynamics of TeO2-PbO- Cu2O-SeO2-Ag2O slag in the literature. Experimentation based on trial and error is time-consuming and challenging. Alternatively; the thermodynamic behavior of this system can be studied with the aid of coupled modeling and key experiments. In the first step; phase diagrams and thermodynamic data (e.g.; enthalpy; entropy; heat capacity) related to the system and available in the literature are collected and critically assessed. Then; preliminary thermodynamic modeling will be conducted based on the collected data. Key phase diagram experiments will be performed when the data is missing or inadequate in the literature. At last; the final thermodynamic optimization will be performed based on the new experimental results. Optimization of unary oxides and binary systems is of utmost importance in thermodynamic modeling. The thermodynamic properties of the former can often be found in thermodynamic compilations. In this project; we focus on the optimization of the binary systems (X-PbO and X-Cu2O) where X is either TeO2; SeO2; or Ag2O.,ElmiraMoosavi-Khoonsari,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Studying in the field of materials science and engineering; metallurgy; or geochemistry Knowledge of thermochemistry and thermodynamics of inorganic materials Knowledge of thermochemical software such as FactSage or Thermo-Calc is an asset Hardworking and motivated to complete a challenging capstone project with many important real-world applications Good time-management; planning; and organizational skills Good critical thinking; and problem-solving skills Good communication and teamwork skills,Engg-Materials
32985,6- AI and Humans Interacting to Form one Explainable Energy Management System,The integration of AI and human interaction in an energy management system can create a powerful and explainable solution that combines the strengths of both.

Based on the analyzed data; the AI component makes intelligent decisions and recommendations regarding energy usage; load scheduling; and system optimization. It can dynamically adjust parameters such as PV generation levels; and load prioritization. The platform will be developed to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with and influence the AI component.

32986,5- Enhancing Occupancy Prediction: Transforming Time-Series Data into 2D Images with Deep Learning,Building occupancy prediction is a crucial task with numerous applications in areas such as energy management; security; and facility optimization. Traditional methods for occupancy prediction often rely on time-series data collected from various sensors within a building(i.e.; CO2 concentration; temperature; humidity;…). However; these approaches may struggle to capture complex spatial relationships that are vital for accurate predictions. In recent years; deep learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing complex data. This project will explore the use of deep learning to transform time-series data into 2D images; and then develop a novel image processing techniques to improve building occupancy prediction.,ManarAMAYRI,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,Python programming; machine learning.,
32987,1- Integrating text analysis to improve load prediction by incorporating social media sentiment,Textual sources of information; such as company reports; social media posts; news articles; and other unstructured texts; hold a wealth of valuable insights that can potentially enhance load forecasting. However; despite the potential relevance of this information; traditional load forecasting algorithms using machine and deep learning often overlook the inclusion of textual data. Load forecasting algorithms typically rely on historical load data; weather patterns; and other structured variables; neglecting the rich contextual information present in textual sources. In this project we will investigate both the innovative forecasting approaches using machine learning and deep learning; and the techniques in natural language processing (NLP); sentiment analysis; and feature extraction to transform it into meaningful inputs that can enhance the accuracy of load forecasting models.,ManarAMAYRI,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,python programming; machine learning,Computer Science

32990,2- Enhancing Short-Term Electric Vehicle Charging Load Forecasting in Low-Quality Data Environments using Machine and Deep Learning.,Accurately predicting electric vehicle (EV) load is crucial for evaluating and optimizing the impact of EVs on the power grid. However; the scarcity of accumulated data from newly operated EV charging stations poses significant challenges in achieving accurate prediction results. Scarce datasets suffer from missing values and outliers; which greatly affect prediction accuracy. Furthermore; training a high-accuracy model with such limited datasets is not feasible. To overcome these challenges and obtain precise EV load predictions; a data generation method will be investigated in this project. This research project entails two main parts: studying recent approaches; particularly focusing on deep learning techniques; for EVs load forecasting; and implementing a novel technique that leverages the benefits of both deep learning and statistical inference.,ManarAMAYRI,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,python programming; machine learning.,Computer Science

The proposed approach involves training deep learning models using historical weather and electricity price data; enabling them to learn complex patterns and relationships between weather conditions and electricity prices. The model's ability to capture intricate nonlinearities and dependencies within the data enhances the accuracy of the forecasting process. The results of this research will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of incorporating weather predictions through deep learning techniques in electricity price forecasting; ultimately aiding decision-making processes in the energy sector.,ManarAMAYRI,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,,
32992,Évaluation de la capacité structurale des ponts atteints de réaction alcalis granulat - Shear capacity of concrete bridges affected by alkali-aggregate reaction,The Alkali Aggregate Reaction (AAR) is an expansion reaction that takes place within hardened concrete; resulting in a significant and damaging state of cracking. A large number of bridges in North America are affected by AAR. While some researchers have observed a reduction in the capacity of AAR affected reinforced concrete structures; many others have observed significantly greater shear capacity. This apparent contradiction is difficult to interpret because of the difference between the in situ conditions of an existing bridge and the laboratory conditions used in research (concrete confinement; prestressing; non-uniformity of cracking; other pathologies) and their effects on shear strength mechanisms. The question therefore asked by a structural engineer is: what are the effects of AAR on the structural capacity of the bridge I have to assess? The current state of knowledge does not allow us to answer this question; and the economic; ecological and social repercussions associated to the reconstruction of a bridge are major. In a context of sustainable development; climate emergency and limited availability of public funds; it is imperative to better understand the mechanisms involved in the shear strength of concrete structures affected by AAR. The aim of this project is therefore to better understand the effect of AAR on the shear resistance mechanisms; in order to propose a model to assess shear capacity of concrete bridges. The project is multi-faceted (prototyping; laboratory testing; computer modeling and analysis; structural design and verification) and can be tailored to suit the interests and skills of the applicants.,MathieuFiset,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-13,- Initiative; - Self-starter; - Creative; - Rigorous; - Basic knowledge of reinforced concrete structures; - Basic knowledge of structural analysis; design and modeling an asset.,
32993,The impact of big data analytics on corporate social responsibility: Evidence from family firms,As the main form of business organization in the world; the family business is an important part of any economy. Technological innovation in family firms has become a topic of increasing interest in management research in recent years. However; there is still a lack of research on big data technology innovation (BDTI) in the family business. This research focuses on big data technology innovation and family business. It will try to study the relationship between technological innovation and financial and social performance in family firms based on socioemotional wealth theory(SEW). Based on the FIBER model; this study will identify different variables that relate BDTI and SEW and proposes a conceptual model and the formulation of hypothesis for exploring the moderating effect of five SEW dimensions (e.g.; family control and influence; family identity; binding social ties; emotional attachment; and renewal of family bonds through dynastic succession) on the relationship between the technological innovation and the corporate social responsability in the context of family firms. This study contributes to the family business literature by offering a conceptual framework of the SEW–BDTI relationship and new research avenues that will provide a better comprehension for scholars and specialists for future investigations in the field.,imenlatrous,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,English,2024-05-01,The students should be enrolled in business adminstration; managment or finance.

32997,Synthesis of flexible fluorescent oligomers for use in chemical sensing applications,Flexible fluorescent oligomers are shorter polymeric systems in which fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are connected to one another by flexible short chains. Flexibility gives the materials improvised processability and solubility; which improves their usefulness.,MarcMacKinnon,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,Students with basic laboratory skills; like those obtained in an undergraduate laboratory course; are required.

32998,Synthesis of indole cyclophanes through bridge contraction,The student will be involved in a larger product that aims to use the powerful new synthetic methodology of C-H activation to construct a new type of cylcophane containing an aromatic indole. Cyclophanes are a privileged class of compounds where an aromatic system is bridged between two non-adjacent positions. As the length of the bridge is shortened; the aromatic system can be bent from planarity; altering its properties through the introduction of strain. These compounds are of interest to researchers since they allow us to probe the nature of aromaticity and push the limits of chemical possibilities.,MarcMacKinnon,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,Students with basic laboratory skills; like those obtained in an undergraduate laboratory course; are required.

32999,Synthesis of twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through ortho-allylation,This project will utilize chemistry developed in our lab for the allylation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This chemistry can be performed regioselectively to give well-defined products that will be further transformed into larger PAHs through metal-catalyzed cross-coupling cyclization reactions. The nature of the allylation products means that the cyclization reaction will give new compounds that contain five or seven-membered rings. The fusion of six-membered benzenoid rings; like in the PAHs naphthalene and pyrene; gives planar systems; but when five or seven-membered rings are incorporated into the molecular scaffold; non-planarity can be induced. There are numerous advantages to non-planarity; including improved solubility; unique photophysical properties; and host-guest chemistry.,MarcMacKinnon,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,Students with basic laboratory skills; like those obtained in an undergraduate laboratory course; are required.

33011,Bioinspiration in engineering future energy systems,We use fish swimming (schooling) habits and bird flight aerodynamics to develop more efficient; fast and stealth energy systems. This requires first a clear understanding of the flow physics associated with these biological processes; and then an innovative approach to replicate and/or surpass the limits of natures using an engineered (man-made) system. Finally; we will utilize these bio-inspired design to develop better technologies for energy harvesting. Thus; this process involves combining fundamental research for knowledge acquisition; tool development; and technology development.,ArmanHemmati,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to have a good understanding of fluid mechanics; structural mechanics and fluid-structure-interactions with familiarity in SolidWorks; Matlab and ANSYS.

Knowledge and familiarity with OpenFOAM and Tecplot are considered a plus.,
33012,Circuit diameters of cubes,The complexity of a linear program (LP) is closely related to the maximum distance between vertices of a polytope along edges; i.e.; its diameter. The now disproven Hirsch conjecture was a linear bound on this distance. Generalizing to allow an LP to take certain steps through the interior of the polytope leads to the still open “circuit” Hirsch conjecture. Evidence for this conjecture is promising and includes the fact that a key counterexample to classical Hirsch is not a counterexample in the circuit case. Unlike classical diameter; circuit diameter depends on the realization of a polytope. Yet it has not been studied in the context of realization spaces. Ideally; we would like to understand how circuit diameter changes across the realization space. This project will approach that study by looking at a single family of polytopes—d-dimensional cubes—for which the circuit diameter is only known for the regular realization. We will begin by exploring the circuit diameter of specific realizations of the cube in low dimensions. Then we will proceed to higher dimensional and more general realizations; focussing in particular on how small perturbations affect this diameter. Further avenues; depending on the progress of the project; would include studying other families of polytopes; and looking for an algebraic characterization of circuit diameter in terms of the realization space.,AmyWiebe,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Student should have - a strong background in linear algebra and be familiar with mathematical proof techniques - some exposure to topics in discrete math (exposure to polytopes is particularly beneficial) - strong computer programming skills (any language in which they can work independently is fine; any math-specific software knowledge is also beneficial) - good communication skills - excellent attention to detail - strong work ethic It would be beneficial for the student to have seen linear programming; exposure to some abstract algebra would also be an asset.,
33013,Data security in smart buildings using federated learning,Modern smart buildings have several IoT sensors; i.e.; temperature; CO2; motion detection; IP camera; HVAC control; etc.. These sensors generate large scale data that can be used in several applications related to smart buildings (e.g. occupancy detection and estimation; activities recognition and prediction; end users services) for energy management systems. Most deployed IoT devices and sensors in smart buildings lack or have extremely weak built-in security which makes them vulnerable to malicious activities and security threats that are harder to detect. The first goal of this project is to detect potential security threats (i.e. intrusion detection) using advanced machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning). The second part of this project is related to preserving data privacy using federated learning. Federated learning enables edge devices to learn a machine learning models by keeping all of the data on the device itself. The models will be trained locally instead of moving the data to the cloud; and only the estimated parameters of the model are shared across the network. Using federated learning gives the following advantages: more accurate and low latency models and privacy-preserving because the data remains on the device; and energy-efficiency because the workload on the device is drastically reduced; leading to lower power consumption and longer device life. The project will be based on real data gathered from four smart houses equipped with different types of sensors. The intern will be involved in pre-processing and analyzing the collected data and building the machine learning models.,NizarBouguila,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to have good programming skills in Python and good knowledge related to machine learning and data mining.,
33014,Energy Disaggregation Using Deep Learning,Many studies have shown that 20-40% of the overall consumption of a country in terms of energy is determined by the domestic household consumption. Thus; improving the energy awareness at household level is a crucial issue in current energy research. Nowadays; smart meters are a key factor to support that research. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) allows to identify appliances according to their power characteristics in the total power consumption of a household measures by a smart meter. The main goal is to show the consumers not only when and what quantity of energy is consumed; but also which appliance is consuming what amount of power at what time (generally referred to as energy disaggregation). Different NILM techniques; based mainly on machine learning algorithms; have been proposed in the past. Unfortunately; until now no approach could solve the disaggregation in all its complexity. The problem is still open and needs a lot of research efforts. The first part of this project will be dedicated to study recent approaches that have been proposed for energy disaggregation with a focus on deep learning techniques. The second part will be devoted to implementing a novel techniques that takes advantage of both deep learning and statistical inference.,NizarBouguila,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,computer science; engineering; good programming skills (Python),Computer Science; Engg-Computer; Engg-Electrical; Engineering; Engg-Systems and Technology
33015,Multivariate Time Series Analysis, Modeling and Applications:,Time series is very ubiquitous in industrial environments. Capturing the time dependency is very useful for time series analysis in several real-life applications. Several univariate time series approaches have been proposed in the past. These approaches cannot effectively handle multivariate time series. Univariate time series can be viewed as zero-order tensor time series while multivariate time series can be considered as one- or higher order tensor time series where each variable depends simultaneously on its past values and on the other variables. The goal of this project is to study recent state of the art multivariate time series analysis and modeling approaches with a focus on smart cities related applications.,NizarBouguila,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,computer science; engineering; good programming skills (Python),Computer Science; Engg-Electrical; Engg-Computer
33016,An online tool to refactor the safety assurance cases of autonomous driving systems,Ensuring the progress of autonomous driving technology used by autonomous vehicles can save lives; prevent injuries; reduce the traffic; the financial burden with car accidents; and the environmental damages caused by vehicles. Developing industry-wide safety standards and making sure producers of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) comply with them is crucial to foster consumer acceptance. Producers of ADSs can rely on assurance cases to demonstrate to regulatory authorities how they have complied with such standards. Assurance cases are mainly used in safety-critical areas (e.g.; automotive; railways; avionics) to deal with high-risk concerns and show to stakeholders that such systems are safe according to domain-specific criteria. Assurance cases are structured as a hierarchy of claims; with lower-level claims drawing on concrete evidence; and also serving as evidence to justify claims higher in the hierarchy. The top claim is a statement such as a system supports non-obvious requirements. The most-used graphical notation to represent assurance cases is the goal structuring notation (GSN). In an assurance case; the nature of the support of each child’s claim to its parent claim can be specified in the GSN using three support patterns. Still; several assurance cases do not yet rely on such support patterns; which makes them poorly structured and not able to properly demonstrate they are sufficiently assuring a given requirement (e.g.; safety). We will therefore develop a web-based tool that will help represent and then refactor assurance cases represented in the GSN by applying support patterns. This will increase the correctness of assurance cases by making sure the inferential links between each parent claim and its supporting children (i.e.; child claims) are properly represented/structured. A novel confidence measure based on Evidential Reasoning will be developed and used to assess the assurance case before and after the refactoring.,AlvineBoaye Belle,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,Good oral and written skills in English; web-based development skills (e.g. good knowledge of JavaScript/REACT framework; Java Spring framework; AWS; Google FireBase or MERN stack); and familiarity with git (e.g. GitHub).,
33017,3- Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Site PV Power Forecasting,Multi-site PV power forecasting refers to the process of predicting the power generation from multiple photovoltaic (PV) sites simultaneously. It is essential for efficient grid management; energy trading; and renewable energy integration. This task presents unique challenges due to the complex and interconnected nature of PV systems across different locations. To tackle these challenges; researchers and practitioners have developed various forecasting techniques. These approaches leverage historical PV power generation data; weather conditions; geographic features; and other relevant factors to build predictive models. Machine learning and statistical methods are commonly employed; including time series analysis; regression models; and artificial neural networks. In this project we will develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) which have emerged as a promising approach for multi-site PV power forecasting; addressing the complex interconnectedness of PV systems across different locations. GNNs leverage graph structures to capture spatial relationships and dependencies between PV sites; improving the accuracy of power generation predictions; and incorporate various data sources,NizarBouguila,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,machine learning; data mining; python,Computer Science; Engg-Electrical; Engineering
33018,7- Tackling Activity Recognition Challenges Through Model Adaptation for Scarcity of Labeled Data,Activity recognition in smart buildings involves using sensors; data analysis; and machine learning techniques to automatically identify and understand human activities within a building environment. The scarcity of labeled data is a common challenge in activity recognition problems. Collecting and annotating large amounts of labeled data can be time-consuming; expensive; and sometimes impractical. In this project we will tackle the problem of activity recognition using model adaptation techniques; that refer to the process of adapting a pre-trained activity recognition model to perform effectively in a new or different domain. This adaptation is necessary when the target domain has different characteristics; such as different sensor types; environmental conditions; which can affect the performance of the pre-trained model.,NizarBouguila,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,Machine learning; data mining; Python,
33019,Tracing the Origins of Municipal Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion (EDI) Strategies,The landscape of equity in Canadian municipal governance is shifting rapidly. There has been an uptick in the adoption of Equity; Diversity; and Inclusion (EDI) initiatives (these may also include a focus on justice and decolonization). In many cities; local NGOs - often; women-focused organizations - have been at the centre of this work; both assisting and pushing municipal governments to advance their work on equity. In Ottawa; the City for All Women Initiative (CAWI) is a key example of an organization that has worked since the early 2000s both inside and outside municipal government to shape the development and adoption of equity tools for municipal practitioners. CAWI’s Advancing Equity and Inclusion Guide for Municipalities; first developed in 2005 as a tool to improve attention to women and gender equity; has been in use in Ottawa since 2018 and serves as the foundation for much of the internally-facing equity work that has been developed in Canadian municipalities. However; little has been documented about the way this current EDI work transformed from a focus on women's equity to a focus on equity more broadly. Moreover; many of the key players who were involved in early iterations of women's equity strategies are now retired from their professional and activist roles and; in some cases; have passed on. This project seeks to a) create an archive of stories about women's municipal-focused activism by capturing the voices of those who are still with us; and b) document the development and early iterations of what we know today to be municipal equity strategies.,TiffanyMuller Myrdahl,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-15,In terms of focus areas; the student should be: knowledgeable about and interested in women in cities; gender equity; intersectional and trans-inclusive analysis; and interested in policy and planning at the municipal scale. In terms of skills; the student should be: -comfortable conducting academic literature reviews; -comfortable reading and analyzing policy documents and grey literature; -interested in undertaking online and in-person archival research to find and gather policy documents; -comfortable writing reports in English; -willing to conduct detailed notetaking of recorded municipal council meetings; -interested in supporting and conducting in-depth interviews; -interested in supporting and conducting qualitative data analysis.,
33020,Mathematical modeling and analysis for oncolytic virotherapy (OV) in cancer immunology,In the OV; the oncolytic viruses were injected into the patients to infect cancer cells. Once the tumor cell is infected; the viruses replicate themselves inside the cancer cell and will be released into the tumor microenvironment to attract more cytotoxic T cells and macrophages to kill cancer cells resulting in tumor eradication. Therefore; the higher population of the viruses is; the better treatment efficacy of OV is. However; the population of the viruses is reduced; if the infected cancer cells are attacked by macrophages before the viruses were released. Thus; the immune checkpoints expressed on macrophages (such as CD200) reduce the functions of macrophages and hence reduce the killing rate of infected cancer cells by macrophages resulting in a higher population of viruses and a better treatment efficacy of OV. Additionally; immune checkpoint inhibitors for T cells (such as anti-PD-1) enhance the killing rate of tumor cells by T cells and hence improve the treatment efficacy of OV. Therefore; combination of overexpression of the immune checkpoint on macrophages and immune checkpoint inhibitors for T cells could obtain the optimal treatment efficacy of OV. In this project; we will work on developing mathematical (ODE) model to capture the immune responses in the combination of overexpression of the immune checkpoint on macrophages and immune checkpoint inhibitors for T cells in the OVs. This ODEs model includes the variables: uninfected tumor cells; virus-infected tumor cells; virus particles; M1 and M2 macrophages; CD8+ T cells; CD200- CD200R; and PD-1-PD-L1 to investigate the optimal treatment efficacy of OV by using numerical simulation; sensitivity analysis; and numerical bifurcation diagram.,Kang-LingLiao,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-13,1.

33021,Mathematical analysis and modeling for the opposite functions of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment,In most of my previous works related to immune checkpoint inhibitors; we used modeling and simulation tools to investigate how the balance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions from different types of treatments affects the tumor growth/treatment outcome. The model structures or the parameter setting could be different due to different treatment targets or cancer types; but the idea is the same: the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions. Thus; in this project; we will generate a general mathematical model incorporating general functions f and g for the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions that can be used for most immune checkpoint inhibitors. Next; we will use mathematical analysis or simulation to derive conditions of the model for tumor reduction/promotion based on the function properties of f and g.,Kang-LingLiao,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-13,1.

33022,CAR-T cell treatment in acute and chronic B cell leukemias and then extend this model to CAR-T cell treatment in cancer treatment,The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy uses the engineering patients’ immune cells to attack the target cells. The treatment efficacy of CAR-T cell treatment in acute and chronic B cell leukemias is excellent; because the biomarkers of malignant B cells on CAR-T cell can accurate target the abnormal B cells and avoid to damage the normal and healthy cells. Recently; researchers started to apply the CAR-T cell therapy to cancers. However; the treatment outcome is not good as expected. The reason is that the biomarkers are not specific to cancer cells; such that the CAR-T cells also attack other normal cells and then cause serious side-effect of the patients. In this project; we will create a mathematical model to capture the mechanism of how the CAR-T cell works in B cell leukemias and the interaction between the biomarkers and B cells. Next; we will modify this model to capture the interaction between CAR-T cells and tumor microenvironment to investigate the potential methods for improving the treatment outcome of CAR-T cell in cancer.,Kang-LingLiao,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-13,1.

33023,Assessing self-paced open degree programs with a mathematical model,An important aspect to consider by a distance education institution when working towards fostering lifelong learning is to ensure that its degree programs are regularly and properly assessed. Based on such assessments; which commonly have both qualitative and quantitative components; the strengths; weaknesses and needs of the programs are identified. This provides a useful ground to initiate and execute the necessary changes in the programs to help guarantee their sustainability. In this project; we aim at using a mathematical tool; given by a system of ordinary differential equations; for assessing the student population dynamics within self-paced open degree programs. The model will be used to quantify the temporal dynamics of various programs through the estimation of various parameters such as the overall enrollment; engagement; withdrawal; and graduation rates; assess their historical performance; and predict the future performance of the programs under consideration. We will also assess the impact that the different model parameters have on the outcome of the programs in terms of number of graduates.,GustavoCarrero,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-06-10,The following areas of mathematics are required: Calculus; Linear Algebra; and Ordinary Differential Equations.

33024,Application of deconvolution methods for resolution enhancement and better interpretation of seismic data,Geophysicists image the underground of Earth to explore renewable and non-renewable resources. To do so; they use seismic sources to propagate seismic waves in the subsurface. Then; they record the reflected seismic energy from the layer interfaces using the recording devices (e.g.; hydrophone or geophone) near the surface or in the wells. The reflected seismic energy is modeled by the convolution of the source signature with the reflectivity series of rock layer interfaces. The reflectivity series shows the changes in the rock properties (Impedance) in different layers in the subsurface. Hence; geophysicists are interested in extracting the reflectivity series information from seismic data. However; seismic data is always noisy. Also; the band-limited nature of the source signature reduces the resolution of the data. Noisy and low resolution nature of seismic data hinders its successful interpretation. Deconvolution is an important technique that can remove the effect of the source signature from the seismic data without boosting the noise. Deconvolution has extensive applications in different fields of study; such as astronomical imaging; medical imaging; digital angiographic images; optics; photography; and geophysics. Deconvolution is a long-lasting and challenging problem to solve. For more than a century; researchers used different constraints or assumptions to develop deconvolution algorithms. However; for real-world applications; some of the assumptions are not valid; resulting in poor performances of the algorithms. In this project; the student will work on developing and testing deconvolution algorithms based on realistic assumptions. To be specific; the student will work on developing deconvolution algorithms based on sparsity assumptions on the reflectivity series and no assumptions on the phase of the source signature and compare the result with well-known deconvolution methods. To deliver this project; familiarity with seismic data is an advantage; however; students with computational and signal processing backgrounds are more than welcome to apply.,NasserKazemi Nojadeh,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,English,2024-05-01,To deliver the project; the student should be familiar with MATLAB or Python programming and basic signal processing concepts.

33030,Chemical ecology and biochemistry of poplar,Poplars contain a large variety active phenolic secondary metabolites; including tannins and phenolic glycosides. These chemicals allow poplar species to thrive in diverse but often stressful environments. Condensed tannins can act as general defense compounds; antimicrobials and antioxidants; while the salicinoid phenolic glycosides protect poplar against insect herbivores. Our aim is to understand the regulation and biosynthesis of these phenolic secondary metabolites; and to test their importance using transgenic plants. For example; poplar trees with reduced phenolic glycoside concentrations have been produced in our laboratory using CRISPR technology. These have demonstrated an essential step in phenolic glycoside biosynthesis; and also provide a unique research opportunity for poplar chemical ecology. Additional CRISPR-mutants are being created; and these will be characterized by the student. The project's aims is to characterize novel genome-edited poplar lines. We will grow plants under controlled conditions and study the changes in phenolic chemicals due to the mutations in these plants. In parallel; we will conduct bioassays to what effects the change in phenolics has resistance to leaf-eating insects. Poplar trees will be grown in the Centre for Forest Biology's Glover Greenhouse. Phytochemical concentrations in poplar extracts will be assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of methanol leaf extracts using standard procedures. For bioassays; insect bioassays will established using leaves from transgenic and control plants. Leaf area consumed and larval weight gain is a function of plant resistance. All these experiments help to contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and role of poplar phenolic secondary metabolites.,C.

33031,Enhanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Water and Wastewater Treatment,Membrane technologies are currently the most effective and sustainable methods utilized in diversified water filtration; wastewater treatment; and industrial and sustainable energy applications. The major drawback of membrane technologies is fouling phenomenon; which causes a decline in permeation flux; change in selectivity; increase in energy consumption; higher operating costs; and reduced membrane lifetimes. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have gained serious importance in microfiltration; UF; nanofiltration (NF); forward osmosis (FO); and reverse osmosis (RO) applications. Inserting hydrophilic NFs such as nanoparticles (NPs); functional multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWNT); graphene oxides (GO); or zeolites is an effective method of controlling hydrophilicity and morphology of MMMs. Despite their advantageous features; MMMs face multiple drawbacks when it comes to the identification of compatible NFs; as well as the lack of NFs dispersion mechanisms that in turn cause low physical; thermal; chemical; and mechanical stabilities during filtration; chemical cleaning; or backwash processes. This project aims to provide an in-depth assessment and enhancement MMM membrane performance. A novel MMM membrane will be developed and synthesized by the research group and several fouling remediation techniques will be created. For the virtual experience; all the virtual trainings and detailed plan will be provided.,AmiraAbdelrasoul,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-30,This project requires a background in Organic Chemistry and chemical engineering; as well as a background in experimental design; and basics of modeling experience.,
33032,Enhanced Forward Osmosis Membranes for Water and Wastewater Treatment,Continuously escalating global water demands place a substantial burden on the available water and energy resources. Forward osmosis (FO) is an evolving membrane desalination technology that has recently raised interest as a promising low energy process. FO is a unique method since it utilizes natural osmosis as the driving force; and hence; ensures that the energy consumption is significantly reduced; in comparison to other pressure driven membrane processes that are constrained by their excessive energy consumption and unsustainable cost. The resurging interest in the FO membrane process can help it become a sustainable alternative to the conventional membrane processes as well as a new industry standard. Despite the method’s numerous benefits; FO fouling has hindered a more widespread FO application in real-world water purification projects. As a result; the growing interest in FO from various disciplines and industrial sectors calls for a better understanding of the FO process and further advances in the FO technology management. This project aims to provide an in-depth assessment and enhancement of the water transport phenomenon in FO membranes. A novel FO membrane will be developed and synthesized by the research group and several fouling remediation techniques will be created. For the virtual experience; we will integrate all the virtual experience and training needed.,AmiraAbdelrasoul,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-30,This project requires a background in Organic Chemistry and chemical engineering; as well as a background in experimental design; and modeling experience.,
33033,High Efficiency Biomimetic and Bioinspired Hemodialysis Membranes,According to the National Kidney Foundation; the chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10% of the worldwide population. Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining procedure that can help deal with CKD; however; it is also associated with acute side effects that may involve life-threatening and chronic side-effects that diminish the patient’s quality of life. According to the Kidney Foundation of Canada 2017; more than 3 million Canadians have chronic kidney disease; a number that increases at a rate of 5-7% per year; or specifically around 1 in 10 Canadians has kidney disease and millions more are currently at risk. Therefore; Hemodialysis is an essential treatment for severe kidney failure (renal failure or end stage renal disease; ESRD); when the kidneys are no longer working effectively and waste products and fluids are building up in the blood. Unfortunately; this membrane-based hemodialysis therapy is still an incomplete renal replacement; as the mortality and morbidity rated for these patients remain unacceptably high. Hemodialysis Membrane performance; as determined by the effectiveness of solute clearance and biocompatibility; is of the utmost concern when choosing a dialyzer. As a result; technological advances in membrane designs and their chemical compositions are essential; especially since they are critical for enhanced hemodialysis performance and versatility that will reduce morbidity rates and prolong patient survival. The goal of the present study is to control the membrane’s morphology with Medium Molecular Weight Cut-Off membrane MWCO membranes; and to promote the removal of protein-bound uremic toxins and middle to large molecular-weight solutes.,AmiraAbdelrasoul,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-30,This project requires a background in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering; as well as a background experimental design; and modeling experience.

33034,Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Membranes with Enhanced Hydrophilicity and Biocompatibility,Membrane technology is a rapidly developing research area; with key growth in large-scale industrial applications; including biotechnology; biomedical applications; food industry; and water and wastewater treatment. Unfortunately; membranes are prone to the fouling phenomenon; which leads to high operational costs; increased power consumption; and reduced membrane lifetime. The goal of the proposed membrane design is to make its particular process highly efficient; cost effective; easily applicable; and sustainable. In order to obtain these key improvements; advances in membrane materials are necessary for the membrane technologies; and a revolutionary progress of membrane materials is needed for properly tackling the water and energy sustainability. Although there have been a number of attempts to improve this type of membrane technology; the understanding of membrane fouling and its consequent permeate flux decline still remain a challenge. The major goal of the present study is to enhance the membranes’ hydrophilicity and biocompatibility for a variety of critical applications. In this study; molecular dynamic simulation will be used so as to design new filtration membranes; as well as comprehensively understand water transport; organic solute rejection in polymeric membranes; and membrane properties at the molecular scale.,AmiraAbdelrasoul,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-30,This project requires a background in Organic Chemistry; basic knowledge about molecular simulations capabilities; and an interest in learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,
33035,Investigating the effectiveness of argument mapping in post-secondary classrooms,Many existing instructional approaches aim to promote a student’s reasoning ability through computer-assisted argumentation. An example of computer-assisted argumentation would be web-based argument mapping. The proposed research aims to conduct a meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of web-based argument mapping tools in promoting reasoning skills in post-secondary education. Argument mapping is an instructional approach that helps students to see inferential connections between claims and evidence; and assess them in terms of argument structure validity and soundness of premises. Students use diagrams to show the relationships between claims and evidence presented in an argument. Research has revealed a positive gain of using online argument mapping tools in various instructional settings with different populations; but there has been a lack of understanding of the parameters leading to such gain. The proposed study will thus synthesize past and current research on argument mapping tools through a meta-analysis. The investigation is important to inform instructional practices; assisting post-secondary instructors in integrating argument mapping into their teaching.,DanielChang,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-07-31,- Familiarity with research methods; including conducting literature reviews and data extraction. - Strong analytical skills and experience with statistical analysis software (e.g.; SPSS). - Excellent organizational skills and attention to detail. - Proficient in academic writing and communication. - Previous experience with meta-analyses or systematic reviews is desirable but not required. - Ability to work independently and meet deadlines.,
33036,Aging of high-performance fabrics used in firefighter protective clothing,Several families of high-performance fibers have been developed over the last 50 years with exceptional properties in terms of mechanical and chemical resistance; inherent flame resistance; and thermal stability. This includes aramids (e.g.; Kevlar®; Nomex®; Kermel®); poly (melamine-formaldehyde) (Basofil®); polybenzoxazole (PBO; Zylon®); and polybenzimidazole (PBI). However; the various conditions these fibers are exposed to during the lifetime of the protective clothing reduce their performance over time. The damaging conditions a firefighter protective clothing can be exposed to during service include: 1. High heat from the fire; between 60 and 300°C inside a burning room or a small burning building; and around 1000°C in the case of flash fire; 2. UV radiation from direct sunlight during outdoor operations; fluorescent lamps during indoor activities and storage; and fire; 3. Moisture from the extinguishing medium; weather conditions; matter’s burning process; the clothing wearer's perspiration; and the clothing laundering. Through this research; fabrics used in manufacturing firefighter-protective clothing are subjected to different aging conditions to evaluate their physical and chemical alteration. The aging conditions are defined to simulate the actual service conditions of the fire protective garments. The objectives of the research are: 1. Understand the kinetic and mechanisms of the cumulative and individual impact of aging agents on the common material used in fire protective garments; 2. Define the acceleration aging conditions that can be achieved within a lab environment simulating actual service conditions; aligning with different working conditions and firefighter categories; 3.

The proposed project focuses on the effects of acidity on lichens. Next year we will be resampling plots that were treated with lime in 2019 to lower acidity and control plots. Lichens and understorey vegetation will be sampled at different distances from clearcut forest edges. In addition to helping with resampling and other field work; this project will include data analysis comparing results to the data collected before liming to evaluate the effects of acidity on epiphytic lichens.

33041,Patterns of vegetation structure and biodiversity across heterogeneous forested landscapes in Nova Scotia, Canada,A major consequence of forest fragmentation is edge influence on vegetation in which forest structure and composition differs at harvested or agricultural edges compared to interior forest. Vegetation responses to forest edges are variable and depend on edge type; forest type; geographic location and other stand characteristics. However; it is difficult to make comparisons because of the extensive time involved for field studies. With the advent of remote sensing; especially LIDAR; an understanding of the extent of edge effects on forest ecosystems can be made using quantitative; accurate and repeatable techniques that measure the intensity of the effects on the vegetation structure of forest edges. The project will use LIDAR imagery to retrieve detailed inventory parameters of forest ecosystems and incorporate remote sensing to assess patterns of vegetation structure at forest edges. Details on locations; edge types and forest types are still being determined; but the project will likely focus on forest edges within Nova Scotia; Canada. However; a possible sub-project for the intern could be analysing LIDAR imagery from their own country. The project will likely consist of two components: widely available LIDAR imagery to examine broad-scale patterns and LIDAR imagery collected using a drone next summer. Although the original intent of the project was to investigate harvested edges; fire edges may be added. At the time of this writing; there are unprecedented fires burning in Nova Scotia; highlighting the relevance of fire disturbance with respect to climate change; therefore understanding the structure of fire edges is becoming more important. LIDAR imagery will be used to determine the distance of edge influence or edge width on vegetation structure and structural diversity. Comparisons will be made between edge types and forest types.,KarenHarper,Nova Scotia,St. Mary's University,English,2024-06-03,I am looking for a student with a keen interest and a strong background (coursework) in geography or ecology.

33042,UX for cross-reality applications,Our application enhances the understanding of presented information; leading to more effective and efficient problem-solving by utilizing transitions between or concurrent usage of multiple systems along the RVC. For example; we enable users to transition 3D data visualizations from computer monitor to AR so that users can gain more depth cues and interact with the data using more intuitive ways such as hand gestures and body movements. We are investigating a broad spectrum of design questions; such as how users would prefer to transition virtual objects between points along the RVC; how users would prefer to transition between real; augmented; and virtual spaces; and what interactions are most effective for triggering those transitions. The visiting student will work with my graduate students and me to identify a specific controlled experiment of interest to them and us. The student will then develop a system prototype to run the experiment (We use the Unity game engine to develop spatial-temporal representations of complex and large data running on head-mounted displays like the Varjo XR3 and Microsoft HoloLens 2).

33043,Essais expérimentaux de combustion par micromélange pour turbine à gaz récupérée,Le groupe de recherche CREATEK a développé une nouvelle architecture de turbine; nommée Inside-out Ceramic Turbine (ICT); qui utilise un anneau structurel en fibre de carbone pour retenir les pales en compression. Cette approche permet l'utilisation fiable de céramique dans un rotor; et donc d'opérer à des températures d'entrées de turbine (TIT) élevées; augmentant ainsi l'efficacité et la densité de puissance de turbines à gaz récupérées. Par contre; l'augmentation du TIT mène également à l'augmentation de la température d'entrée de la chambre à combustion (CIT); causant des problèmes tels que des émissions polluantes élevées et des instabilités de combustion. Pour résoudre ces problèmes; une nouvelle approche de combustion par micromélange a été développée; et les résultats préliminaires ont démontrés des émissions polluantes faibles mais une combustion pouvant être instable; surtout avec des carburants moins réactifs ou a basse température. Le projet de recherche vise donc à continuer le développement de cette approche en améliorant la stabilité de combustion et démontrer l'approche avec des carburants alternatifs tels que l'hydrogène et les biocarburants.,MathieuPicard,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,French,2024-05-01,Le stagiaire devra répondre aux exigences suivantes. - Bonne compréhension des principes fondamentaux du génie. - Dynamisme et créativité pour répondre de manière appropriée aux nombreux défis rencontrés en recherche appliqué. - Mentalité entrepreneuriale; capacité à réaliser rapidement des prototypes; autonomie; débrouillardise. - Intérêt et expérience en conception mécanique et/ou en thermodynamique et/ou en combustion. - Expérience pratique en mesure expérimentale.,
33044,Social Impacts of Misinformation Generated in Social Media,In today’s world; misinformation and post-truth; have become common. As misinformation can generate misperceptions; it can negatively affect policies and potentially impact society in various domains; including but not limited to; economy; health; climate change; and foreign policy. The World Economic Forum listed digital misinformation as a key challenge to modern societies in 2013 report. Indeed; misinformation has become a common part of our digital media environments; and is compromising the ability of individuals to create informed decisions and policies. In 2016; ‘post-truth’ was chosen by the Oxford Dictionary as word of the year; after achieving a 2000% increase “in the context of the EU referendum in the United Kingdom. Also; more recently all the debates around the presidential election in the United States; COVID-19; and Twitter shows the importance of the impact of misinformation and conspiracies. A 2016 survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found that 51% of people use social media as their source of news; with Facebook being the top used social media platform for finding; reading; and sharing news. This demonstrates the high and constantly growing impact of online media on perceptions of current affairs and policies. Misinformation is a new challenge in modern life. We are constantly dealing with new information without knowing the real truth. Most of the information disseminated by means of social media; electronic media; and in some cases; through print media. According to the media jargon; terms such as misinformation; fake news; disinformation; and propaganda are all used interchangeably.

33045,Long term trend of air quality in Canada,In most Canadian cites; air quality has been gradually improving during the last 20 years. However; there have been a few examinations of the relationship with the emission reduction that has occurred during the same time period. By investigating the air quality and emission trends for particulate matter; volatile organic compounds; ozone and mercury in southern Ontario and other Canadian cities in the past 20 years; this study will provide useful methodology that could be used in other places to evaluate the effectiveness of emission control measures. Such assessment will aid development of future emission reduction policy.,Xiaohong Xu,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-08,The project requires students from science or engineering programs; such as environmental sciences; environmental engineering; civil engineering; agricultural engineering; resources engineering; biosystems engineering; and mechanical engineering.

33047,Introducing a Scalable object detection algorithm to achieve higher accuracy and computational efficiency in Breast Cancer Images,Mass detection and diagnosis in mammograms is still a challenging problem. Considering recent studies in the field of AI for the early detection of breast cancer using CNN; several limitations can be observed including use of non-representative imaging data for model training; limited validation in external datasets; potential bias in training data; and few comparative data for AI versus radiologists’ interpretation of mammography screening. Previous studies have been mostly small retrospective studies based on highly selected image datasets that contained a high proportion of cancers (median BC proportion in datasets: 26.5%). There is potential for bias due to the use of unbalanced imaging data (that does not represent the spectrum in real-world screening) to train and test models; hence; algorithms may not perform well in actual screening practice. Therefore; a unique AI solution tailored specifically for a large real-world dataset in mammography is drastically required. In this project; based on the extensive literature review; a scalable object detection algorithm will be introduced with the aim of achieving higher accuracy and computational efficiency.,SamanehMazaheri,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-06-03,The student is required to be familiar with Machine learning.

33054,Drug metabolizing enzymes in zebrafish,We use zebrafish as a model organism to examine the evolution and function of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Zebrafish are an excellent model organism for environmental; pharmacology; toxicology and biomedical research. Our interests are in anthropogenic chemicals that are common in the aquatic environment; including human pharmaceuticals and we study the toxicity of a variety of environmentally relevant chemicals. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are of interest because they play a major role in chemical defence; as the major enzyme family involved in oxidative metabolism (Phase I) of xenobiotics. These enzymes are also critical for the generation of important biological signalling molecules like steroids. We have expressed multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes from zebrafish; using a bacterial expression system. This has allowed us to develop a high throughput screening assay to determine what compounds are substrates for these enzymes. We are screening environmentally relevant chemicals in this assay to determine which zebrafish enzymes are likely to contribute to chemical defence in zebrafish. We have a colony of zebrafish that we use to study the effects of environmental chemicals on embryonic; juvenile and adult fish. The intern will be involved in our chemical screening experiments; using biochemical assays for enzyme function; reactive oxygen species generation; and to determine enzyme kinetics for the likely compounds. This will give them experience in a high throughput screening lab. Alternatively; the intern may be involved in chemical exposures to zebrafish; to assess potential substrates for CYP mediated metabolism in vivo. The intern will also be involved in the culture and maintenance of our zebrafish colony and will have the opportunity to be involved in exposure experiments with adult or embryonic fish.,JoannaWilson,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-01,Students should have a strong background in biological sciences; biochemistry; or pharmacology.

33056,Étude de l'effet de l'usure des outils sur la qualité de soudures produites par friction malaxage,Le soudage par friction malaxage est utilisé dans l'industrie du transport et permet de souder des matériaux métalliques de haute résistance. En raison des grands efforts appliqués sur l’outil durant le soudage; celui-ci se dégrade/s’use; ce qui engendre des coûts de remplacement et aussi des défauts dans les matériaux soudés.L'usure est un phénomène complexe à étudier en raison de la multitude de ses origines notamment physico-chimiques (affinités entre certains matériaux) ou thermomécaniques (abrasion; diffusion; adhésion; etc.). Toute modification de l’état général d’un outil de soudage par friction-malaxage est considérée comme de l’usure. Elle peut résulter d’une perte de matière ou encore d’une déformation permanente modifiant l’état de surface ou le volume de l’outil. L'usure a un impact considérable sur le déroulement du procédé : augmentation des efforts; des vibrations et de la température; ce qui entraine une détérioration de la qualité du soudage. Il est donc évident que la géométrie de l'outil; la pression et la rotation sont des paramètres critiques. La dégradation rapide des outils et les coûts qui y sont reliés étant un frein à l’utilisation de ce type de soudage pour la production de masse; une meilleure compréhension du mécanisme d'usure des outils pendant le procédé de soudage permettrait de sélectionner de meilleurs matériaux/géométries d'outils et d'améliorer les propriétés de soudure. Dans ce contexte; ce projet a pour but d’étudier l'effet de la dégradation des outils sur les soudures afin d'obtenir des données précises qui permettront d'élaborer un modèle de soudage par éléments finis; sous le code de calcul ABAQUS; permettant de simuler l’usure des outils.,LyneSt-Georges,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,French,2024-05-01,L'étudiant recherché devrait être familier avec les essais mécaniques et avoir certaines connaissances en métallurgie; notamment dans la préparation d'échantillons pour les analyses en microscopie.

33057,Thermal Impacts on fish development,Anthropogenic activities such as industrial thermal effluent and climate change can impact the temperature of our lakes and rivers. Temperature is a key factor in the biology of fish species because they don’t thermoregulate. Fish have a range of temperatures that they can tolerate wit optimal temperatures where they perform best. Development is highly temperature dependent; not only in the rate of development and timing of hatching but in growth and survival. Our project focuses on the effect of increased incubation temperature on fish development; using Canadian native species that are commercially; ecologically and culturally important or zebrafish as a model species. We have demonstrated that elevated temperatures in development can lead to specific phenotypes at hatching; fish are smaller; have a larger yolk sac and less developed jaws and fins. Our current projects focus on temperature alone or in combination with chemical exposures and examine the impacts during embryogenesis and post-hatching. Our experiments determine the morphology and growth and a range of morphological features (eye; jaw and fin development). These assessments require the intern to learn fish development and manipulate both embryos and hatchling fish that have been fixed. Samples are imaged under light microscopy for developmental staging and to determine the morphological characters. Our experiments also determine cardio-metabolic impacts (heart rate; oxygen consumption; vascularization) and behavioural assessments of hatchlings and juvenile fish reared at different temperatures. We have assessed a range of behaviour in hatchlings such as feeding responses; light:dark responses; general activity levels; startle responses; thigmotaxis (open field test); chemoresponses and thermal preferences. Behaviours are assessed in appropriate arenas with video capture and are scored manually; or where possible; with automated behavioural software.,JoannaWilson,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-01,Students should have a strong background in biological or environmental sciences. Previous work with vertebrates or in aquatic sciences is considered an advantage. For an intern working on morphology; previous training in vertebrate development and experience with light microscopy would be an advantage. For an intern working on the behavioural assays; previous training in animal behaviour would be an advantage. Trainees will be required to take a number of health and safety and animal care courses prior to working in the lab. For all assays; we provide training sets to ensure the data collection is comparable to prior research.,
33058,Nano-Satellite Drones: Conceptual Design,This project focuses on completing the conceptual design of a nano-satellite drone for very low earth orbit flight. Using a combination of existing knowledge in literature and new out-of-the-box ideas from within our group that are tested with simulations; this project aims to develop the next generation of the conceptual design of the Nano-Sat drone. The first generation was explored last year in a separate Masters' thesis. This project is to build on the basis of the exiting UofA Satellite currently in orbit (AlbertaSat Cube Sats).,ArmanHemmati,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to have a good understanding of fluid mechanics; aeronautics and aircraft design with familiarity in SolidWorks and ANSYS. The right candidate will need to complete literature review; develop conceptual designs; and CAD models based on design principles in literature.,
33059,Using Big Data to Assess the Performance of Public Transit Systems,Sustainable transportation modes such as public transit and active transport play a major role in addressing climate change and achieving Vision Zero objectives; as well as providing equity and fairness through the provision of mobility and accessibility that could not be otherwise met for the lower-income population. There are both short-term and expected long-term travel behavioural changes given disruptions such as health pandemics; the emergence of autonomous vehicles; teleworking; and the sharing economy. This research investigates how public data can be employed to study travel behaviour and the modal; temporal; and spatial travel focusing on sustainable transportation modes. The data comes from various sources: General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS); Google Transit API; and other relevant data sources will be employed to understand service supply and demand changes during a certain period of time. Spatial and temporal data from social media (such as Twitter) and the Transit app will be also be employed for tracking passengers' travel behaviour during the same period. Combining these data sources; there is an opportunity to perform data fusion and time series analysis and investigate travel pattern changes; modal shifts; and transit demand key performance indicators (KPI) over time. Geographical Information Systems in Transportation will also be used to integrate and fuse many of these data. The finding from this analysis will be useful for decision-makers and the research community to determine the adequacy of the use of open data sources for tracking travel behaviour and modal shifts and whether some of these emerging data sources can be used as an alternative to the higher cost methods (e.g. manual surveys) or closed data.This project will be part of the large scale research program on "Urban Transport System Diagnosis; Monitoring; and Management using Mobility Sensing Data".,SaeidSaidi,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,Programming; data analysis; data visualization; and familiarity with Machine Learning are requied for this project. Education and experience in transportation engineering and public transit operations and modeling is an asset. Familiarity with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) will be also a great asset.,
33060,Manipulating Regulatory Genes to Modulate Biopolymer Production,Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are important for many biotechnological applications including synthesis of nanocellulose; consisting of an ultra-fine network of nanofibres. The unique nanomorphology of bacterial cellulose contributes to its tensile strength and highly crystalline structure. Extracellular cellulose is a crucial component of the biofilm structure of many bacteria facilitating attachment and providing protection. This project will use targeted mutational analysis to investigate regulatory control points involved in cellulose biosynthesis.,JaniceStrap,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-13,Students should have a working knowledge of aseptic technique.

33061,Unraveling neurophysiological mechanisms of somatosensory and motor interactions,Somatosensory afferents contribute to the planning and adaptation of movements and postures according to the ongoing state of the body and the environment. They play a key role in motor learning by providing information about errors in the motor command and; when altered; can have a drastic impact on motor control. Although the link between sensory and motor systems is undisputable; the underlying mechanisms by which somatosensory inputs shape motor control remain unclear. The advent of non­invasive neurostimulation opened up new opportunities to study human neurophysiology and sensorimotor control. The combined use of peripheral stimulation; causing an experimentally controlled sensory inflow; with transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex highlighted complex interactions between sensory and motor networks. The repeated application of sensory stimuli can also lead to sustained plastic changes through mechanisms similar to those observed during motor learning. However; evidence from this emerging field of research remain scarce and heterogenous. The widespread use of electrical nerve stimulation; depolarizing a mixed population of motor and sensory fibers (skin; muscle; joint; tendon); might in part account for the high variability of results across studies. Being able to isolate different sub­types of sensory afferents would lead to significant advancements in our comprehension of modality­ specific interactions between sensory and motor networks. The goal of the present research is to elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of somatosensory and motor interactions. We will verify how different somatosensory inputs activated by peripheral electrical; magnetic and vibration interact with motor cortical excitability and neural plasticity. Renown experimental paradigms (paired­-pulse; paired­associative; repeated stimulation) will be applied using technologies and procedures complying with the highest standards in the fields of human neurophysiology and sensorimotor control.,Louis-DavidBeaulieu,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-06,1.

33062,Exploring Haskap (Lonicera caerulea) traits throughout the course of pre and post-harvest stages : Insight into ethylene production, quality changes, enzymatic activities, and redox signalling,There is evidence that Haskap is a climacteric fruit; but this has not been proven physiologically; nor the possible links between the production of ethylene; respiration; and alternative oxidase (AOX) activity; which can alter the overall metabolism of the fruit. Thus; it is intended to establish the ripening profile of two Haskaps cultivars (i.e.; Aurora and Boreal Blizzard) based on their respiration rates; ethylene production; enzymatic activity; including AOX; CAT; APX; and the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). A Ph.D. student will perform the physiological profiling on both cultivars; the enzymatic activities of AOX; CAT and APX; and ROS quantification after treatments. The intendent B.Sc.1 will support him by determining the content H2O2 during the development of the fruit. Physiological measurements will be carried out during fruit development after anthesis. The total ROS determination (primarily Н2О2; but also О2•−; and ОН•) will be done by fumigating the fluorescent probe 2';7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) on plant material; and the related produced image will be acquired using a bioluminescence system. The possible modification of AOX and its retrograde modification by ROS represent a new frontline in the regulation of ripening.,ArturoDuarte Sierra,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-15,Students should preferably have a background in food science; biochemistry; biochemical engineering; chemistry; horticulture or agriculture.

33063,High throughput functional proteomics for surface proteins on stem-cell derived cells,Proteomics is a high throughput analysis of the structure and function of proteins in biological systems. Our comprehensive proteomic analyses employs liquid chromatography (LC) as a separation tool and the mass spectrometry (MS) as a detection tool to identify and quantify cell surface proteins and their posttranslational modifications; such as glycosylation. In a typical analysis; proteins will be extracted from biological samples; digested into peptides enzymatically. Peptides of interest will be chemically enriched; selectively analyzed through LC-MS. Thousands of peptide MS spectra can be acquired in a short duration and processed by bioinformatics tools to infer hundreds of proteins' structure and function simultaneously. This project will focus on improving the sensitivity of the method that we have developed previously (Adams; et al.; Int. J. Mol. Sci.; 2022). Our lab has extensive experiences with mammalian cells including mouse and human stem cells. The new knowledge gained from these high throughput analyses will help us draw novel insights into cell biology and physiology. Executing these projects will help students gain hands on experiences on all aspects of proteomics technology; including protein chemistry; liquid chromatography separation techniques; tandem mass spectrometry; and data-analysis skills. Our lab also harbors various molecular and cellular techniques; such as mammalian cell culture and assays besides LC-MS bioanalyses; which can be acquired during training.

33067,Power calculation in multivariate analysis,Sample size calculation plays a crucial role in multivariate analysis. It is a critical step in the research process; ensuring that the sample adequately represents the population of interest. Multivariate analysis involves analyzing multiple variables simultaneously; aiming to identify relationships; patterns; or differences between variables. Determining an appropriate sample size is essential to ensure the statistical power; precision; and generalizability of the findings. A sample size that is too small may result in insufficient statistical power; leading to inconclusive or unreliable results. On the other hand; an excessively large sample size may be impractical; time-consuming; and expensive. The research proposal aims to develop power calculation approaches for multivariate analysis methods. The student will collaborate in the development of method; simulation analysis as well as programming in R to be integrated into an R package.,AidaEslami,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,Required: Statistical methods and concepts Familiarity with multivariate analysis (e.g.; principal component analysis) Experience using R statistical programming language Time management skills Ability to work both independently and in a team environment Excellent communication skills in English or French (oral and written) Preferred but not necessary: Familiarity with simulation analysis in R,
33069,Additive manufacturing of shape transforming structures,Today’s reconfigurable structures are either: strong; adaptable; or lightweight. Reconfigurable aircraft structures require achieving all the three characteristics in a single material; which is the challenge we design engineers are facing for decades. Intelligent structures possessing the above characteristics mandate the use of smart materials – materials whose physical properties can be altered by external stimuli like stress; moisture; electric and magnetic fields; light; temperature; and chemical substances. As the airplanes; cars; wind turbine blades today are being manufactured from fiber reinforced polymer (FRP); integrating smart materials; for shape adaptation would result in considerable weight and space savings. Structural health monitoring with embedded sensors will result in efficient and timely repair and thus; enhanced product life cycle. Inspired from the nature’s growth and development; three-dimensional (3D) printing serves as the most pertinent fabrication tool for intelligent structures delivering organic and efficient complex geometries; which are a characteristic of an efficient bird flight; our inspiration from nature. But; the smart materials of today are inefficient and unreliable compared to their conventional mechanical rigid body alternatives and hence; do not satisfy the aircraft accreditation requirements for safety. This research project aims at developing these smart materials and improving their compatibility with the high strength materials. The know-how gained in this project can be directly applied to build intelligent planes; cars; wind turbine blades; and other structural and functional composite components; especially in customized equipment like prosthesis; rehabilitation-aid; exoskeletons; and sports equipment towards individuals.,SampadaBodkhe,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The project is looking for undergraduate or graduate interns with backgrounds in materials science; mechanical; chemical; biomedical or electrical engineering to address multiple objectives of the project described in the next section.

33070,Characterization of the innate mucosal immunity of the upper airways in wild mammals,Respiratory infections are a main cause of morbidity and mortality in many wild mammals including ungulates and carnivores. The innate immune response of the nasal cavity and other airways is crucial for the early control of respiratory pathogens in most animal species. However; the proteins and cells involved in this response are poorly characterized in wild animals; preventing further assessment of the role of innate mucosal immunity on the transmission of respiratory pathogens in these species. This project aims to characterize the leukocyte populations and innate immunity proteins in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa of South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). For this project; nasal and nasopharyngeal biopsies were collected in 2022 from healthy wild African buffalo and South American fur seals. These biopsies will be processed for histological assessment and through immunohistochemistry the populations of T and B lymphocytes; macrophages; dendritic cells; plasma cells; neutrophils and eosinophils will be characterized. Additionally; we will identify the location and relative abundance of proteins involved in the control of respiratory pathogens such as immunoglobulin A (IgA); type I interferons (alpha and beta); cathelicidins and defensins using immunohistochemistry and proteomics. We expect to identify a significant number of T-lymphocytes associated to the respiratory mucosa as well as few neutrophils and macrophages. We expect to identify IgA producing plasma cells in the lamina propria and secretory IgA in the respiratory epithelium and cathelicidins and defensins in neutrophils; macrophages and epithelial cells. This project will be critical to characterize the innate immunity landscape of healthy long-living wild mammals; a critical step to later understand how this landscape changes in response to respiratory pathogens.,MauricioSeguel,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-06-03,The most important motivation for students working in this program should be the pursuing of a career in science and a genuine interest in animal immunology and pathology.

33073,Regulation of HUMANIN in response to maternal obesity,Exposure to maternal obesity during prenatal and postnatal periods is a powerful early-life stress that can shape developmental and behavioral outcomes in offspring. In particular; exposure to maternal obesity lead to metabolic diseases (type II diabetes; high blood pressure); increase in body weight and adiposity; and altered neurodevelopmental outcomes (lower IQ and autism spectrum disorders) in children. The discovery of humanin (HN/MTRNR2) 20 years ago blazed a trail to characterizing small peptides with biological function; that originate solely from the mitochondria; the powerhouse of the cell. Humanin is associated with pro-survival; anti-inflammatory; and anti-oxidative properties and may play a role in reducing neurodegenerative and metabolic disease progression. This specific peptide was given the name “humanin” because of its ability to reverse and/or reduce the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Humanin is present not only in humans but in several other mammals; amphibians; and reptiles and increase in expression and activity soon after an acute cellular insult and/or stress. However; the regulation of humanin in the offspring brain in response to maternal obesity exposure (a chronic stress) is yet to be investigated. The students will use a maternal obesity-centric rodent model to study the functional dynamics of humanin; in the brain (hippocampus; hypothalamus; and the frontal cortex); heart; liver; and kidneys during critical periods of early postnatal development. Students will obtain hands on experience in animal handling; diet regiments; animal dissections; animal behavior testing; and molecular biology techniques; including but not limited to DNA/RNA/Protein extractions; qPCR; protein immunoblotting; ELISAs; and bioinformatics tools for protein folding and identification methods.

33075,Feasibility of alternative low carbon retrofit solutions for existing buildings.,Buildings are a leading source of emissions contributing to over 40% of the total energy use globally and resulting in about 39% of the total direct and indirect CO2 emissions. With commitments made by several nations to reach net zero emissions by 2050; efforts are needed to decarbonize building energy use. Canada's buildings currently account for about 12% of the total CO2 emissions. Constructing new net-zero buildings will not help us reach net-zero by 2050 if nothing is done to ensure that the existing buildings are retrofitted with low carbon energy systems. Working with local property developers and property managers; this project aims to identify; evaluate and analyze the feasibility of low carbon energy systems for space heating and cooling in Canada's cold climate. The project will identify all the possible alternatives to natural gas for space heating and evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of each. Working with building owners; building energy load profiles will be obtained; analyzed; and used in the proper design and sizing of any proposed retrofit solutions.

33084,Population Determinants of a Satisfying Life,Subjective well-being refers to the cognitive evaluation and affective feelings towards the quality of one’s life. It has gained significant attention as a policy indicator of population well-being (i.e.; subjective well-being measured at a population level). For instance; governments in the United Kingdom and France now track citizens’ subjective well-being; and annually; a World Happiness Report is published documenting key findings on well-being across the Globe. Therefore; more policymakers recognize that a flourishing society should cultivate a satisfying life among citizens. The overarching goal of the research project is to examine how major population events and societal changes are linked to citizens' well-being.,FelixCheung,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-20,Students with background in psychology; public health; economics; statistics; or a related quantitative social science disciplines are encouraged to apply.

33085,Population Consequences of Subjective Well-being,Subjective well-being refers to the cognitive evaluation and affective feelings towards the quality of one’s life. It has gained significant attention as a policy indicator of population well-being (i.e.; subjective well-being measured at a population level). For instance; governments in the United Kingdom and France now track citizens’ subjective well-being; and annually; a World Happiness Report is published documenting key findings on well-being across the Globe. Therefore; more policymakers recognize that a flourishing society should cultivate a satisfying life among citizens. While subjective well-being has been linked to many desirable individual-level outcomes; how well-being is linked to population-level outcomes is less clear. Through this research project; we will extends this research area by focusing on population-level outcomes; such as election outcomes; collective actions; and population health. Understanding the consequences of population well-being will further motivate communities and stakeholder to invest in citizens' quality of life.,FelixCheung,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-20,Students with background in psychology; public health; economics; statistics; or a related quantitative social science disciplines are encouraged to apply.

33086,The Policy Relevance of Happiness,Subjective well-being refers to the cognitive evaluation and affective feelings towards the quality of one’s life. It has gained significant attention as a policy indicator of population well-being (i.e.; subjective well-being measured at a population level). For instance; governments in the United Kingdom and France now track citizens’ subjective well-being; and annually; a World Happiness Report is published documenting key findings on well-being across the Globe. Therefore; more policymakers recognize that a flourishing society should cultivate a satisfying life among citizens. The research project aims to examine the public opinion on subjective well-being as a policy indicator. Do citizens think happiness is a good social indicator? How does this opinion vary across age; gender; social groups; and political affiliations? What are the perceived promises and challenges in using happiness as a policy indicator?,FelixCheung,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-20,Students with background in psychology; public policy; survey method; or a related quantitative social science disciplines are encouraged to apply.

33087,The Long but Dissatisfying Life in Hong Kong,Subjective well-being refers to the cognitive evaluation and affective feelings towards the quality of one’s life. It has gained significant attention as a policy indicator of population well-being (i.e.; subjective well-being measured at a population level). For instance; governments in the United Kingdom and France now track citizens’ subjective well-being; and annually; a World Happiness Report is published documenting key findings on well-being across the Globe. Therefore; more policymakers recognize that a flourishing society should cultivate a satisfying life among citizens. Hong Kong presents an interesting case study where objective and subjective indicators of societal progress diverge. Despite Hong Kong's high GDP and world-leading longevity; subjective well-being in Hong Kong is among the worst among similarly developed societies. Explicating why this is the case will advance our understanding of how public policies can be better aligned to promote citizen well-being.,FelixCheung,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-20,Students with background in psychology; economics; public policy; survey method; or a related quantitative social science disciplines are encouraged to apply.

33088,Effects of environmental pollutants in the Arctic using in vitro assays,The Arctic is traditionally considered a pristine environment; but toxicological research over the past decades has revealed that environmental pollutants used and released in industrialized regions of the world reach the Arctic through long-range transportation processes. Once there; these chemicals accumulate in Arctic food webs and biomagnify to alarming levels in apex predators like polar bears; toothed whales; and seals. These species are exposed to hundreds of legacy chemicals as well as potentially hundreds of new chemicals; termed chemicals of emerging Arctic concern (CEACs). For many of these chemicals we have very little data or understanding of their bioaccumulation (uptake by organisms) and even less regarding their adverse effects (toxicity). Given the large and growing list of environmental chemicals; it is practically impossible to test them all using traditional animal exposure models. As such; we are turning to animal-free cell-based approaches to tackle the issues of chemical testing. In vitro laboratory assays can make use of various cell types; experimental designs; and analytical techniques to characterize the bioaccumulation and toxicity of priority chemicals. The focus of this project will be to develop; test; and apply in vitro assays to characterize the toxicology of CEACs. The student will design and carry-out cell culture experiments with difference cell lines and CEACs and measure bioaccumulation potential and several toxicity endpoints including cell viability; cell-specific function (e.g. immune function for immune cells); receptor binding; and gene expression.,Jean-PierreDesforges,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic laboratory skills and be comfortable in a molecular biology lab setting. Experience with cell culture and cellular assays is a major asset. Background in toxicology is useful; but not necessary.,
33089,Respirateur liquidien,Malgré des efforts constants pour optimiser les techniques de ventilation mécanique conventionnelle; la prise en charge respiratoire des nouveau-nés les plus prématurés; qui sont de plus en plus fréquents dans les unités de soins intensifs néonataux; demeure laborieuse et très dommageable pour le système respiratoire. Pour répondre à ce défi médical; le néonatologiste Étienne Fortin-Pellerin; veut offrir à ces prématurés un support ventilatoire prophylactique grâce au ventilateur liquidien Inolivent développé par le professeur Philippe Micheau. Cette technologie expérimentale; unique au monde et jamais déployée sur l’humain; permet une ventilation liquidienne totale en remplissant les poumons avec un liquide respirable et en assurant son renouvellement pour maintenir les échanges gazeux. L’objectif est de repousser les frontières de la technologie Inolivent afin de faciliter la transition vers la recherche clinique sur des prématurés extrêmes humains (500 -700 g). La réduction d’échelle d’un facteur 3; le changement d’espèces et l’allongement à plusieurs jours de la VLT constituent les défis majeurs de ce projet. Le stagiaire viendra en support de l'équipe de recherche en mécatronique qui porte sur la conception du respirateur (pousse-seringues; valves; chauffage; unité de traitement du PFOB; Arduino; Pi).

33090,Customer Service Trends in Canada: A Social Network Analysis,The research project aims to utilize Twitter data to study customer service trends in Canada through the application of social network analysis. Twitter has become a significant platform for individuals to express their opinions and experiences regarding customer service interactions with various businesses. By analyzing the vast amount of data available on Twitter; this research project seeks to uncover valuable insights into the customer service landscape in Canada. The project will collect and analyze tweets about customer service experiences in different industries; such as telecommunications; banking; e-commerce; and more. The data will be obtained using relevant keywords and hashtags associated with customer service interactions. By examining the content of the tweets; sentiment analysis techniques can be applied to determine the overall sentiment of customers towards specific businesses or industries. Social network analysis will be employed to explore the relationships and interactions between customers; businesses; and customer service representatives on Twitter. This analysis will identify key influencers; communities; and patterns of communication within the customer service network. By mapping out the network; researchers can gain insights into the dynamics of customer service interactions; including information flow; customer satisfaction levels; and potential issues faced by customers. The findings of this research project can have significant implications for businesses in Canada. By understanding customer service trends and identifying areas for improvement; companies can enhance their customer service strategies; address customer concerns proactively; and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally; the research outcomes can provide valuable insights to policymakers and regulatory bodies; helping them make informed decisions to protect consumer interests and promote better customer service practices across industries. It is important to note that all data collected and analyzed in this research project will be anonymized and handled in compliance with ethical considerations and privacy regulations.,SidneyShapiro,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,The student involved in this research project should possess strong skills in Python programming; as it will be the primary language used for data collection; analysis; and visualization. Proficiency in working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is also beneficial; as it will enable the student to access and retrieve data from the Twitter platform.

This knowledge will aid in understanding and applying appropriate methods to analyze the relationships and interactions within the customer service network on Twitter.,
33092,Design and development of tools to build in vitro 3D cancer models,Precision medicine for oncology aims to predict the response of a cancer patient to a therapy. Currently; this is performed by screening the tumor for biomarkers that suggests a patient will respond positively to a therapy. However; there are relatively few treatments that target specific biomarkers. In addition; the tumor microenvironment (TME) can greatly influence how a patient responds to a specific treatment regiment. A method that shows promise to fill this gap is the use of 3D tumor models. We develop methods to build more complex 3D models that contain tumor stromal cells; immune cells; and patient-derived tumor cells to better replicate the TME than previous 3D tumor models and in turn; improve the ability to predict a patient response to a treatment. This would allow clinicians to provide more effective treatments and limit the toxicity to the patient of drugs that will not work. This project is to design and build new hardware to make these 3D tumor models. There are two parts to this project. The first is to improve the design of our current method of using guides to cut tubing containing the cells and hydrogel mix to form cylindrical constructs. The second part is to design a new high-throughput method of making the tumor models based on a plug flow method similar to what is used for microencapsulation.,DeanChamberlain,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,The student needs both the theoretical and applied skills to design; model and build various pieces of unique hardware used to make the 3D tumor models used by the laboratory.

33093,3D geometric inspection and predictive monitoring of non-rigid parts,Product and structure quality significantly affect manufacturing companies' sustainability by deploying non-destructive evaluation (NDE). NDE provides tools to inspect for flaws; imperfections; malfunctions; and anomalies without damaging parts. The 3D geometric inspection aims to verify the manufactured products' conformity and monitor structures' geometric condition. Computer-aided inspection (CAI) applies 3D optical and laser scanners to digitize the geometric surface of parts and compare it with reference models to detect defects and geometric anomalies. Geometric inspection of non-rigid parts/large-scale structures (N-RP/L-SS); e.g.; parts made of sheet metals in aircraft and vehicle fabrication and metallic infrastructures; is largely performed in the industrial context. Due to the flexibility of N-RP/L-SS; the inspection is typically performed on physical fixtures to immobilize and constrain components in the required inspection position. As a result; fixtures are robust and require low qualification; but they are dedicated to a single product inspection requiring modification and reconstruction for each change that imposes high costs. This project aims to reduce the use of inspection fixtures by developing smart real-time fixtureless CAI of N-RP/L-SS under large deformation. Using advanced nonlinear modeling/simulation; robotized 3D scanners; optimization; and artificial intelligence tools; the geometric state of equipment/structures is monitored in real-time to detect defects of products in each manufacturing process to avoid processing a faulty part and eliminate poor quality assemblies. Meanwhile; it enables predicting undesired deformation and geometric anomalies of infrastructures to associate geometric changes with potential failures or breakdowns and raise the alarm before they occur. The performance and robustness of CAI methods will also be evaluated and analyzed concerning the impact of measurement noise generated by 3D scanners. The project comprises fixtureless CAI of N-RP/L-SS under large deformation using robotized 3D scanners for geometric data; validation and verification of developed methods; smart and automatic defect detection in real-time; and geometric anomalies prediction.,SasanSattarpanah Karganroudi,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The subjects require a knowledge of 3D geometric metrology and computer-aided inspection; finite element analysis (FEA); and strong interest; knowledge and skills in computer programming; numerical and data analysis.,

33096,Design, Development and Evaluation of a Portable Microwave Breast Cancer Detection Device,Access to early breast cancer screening is limited in rural populations and developing countries; resulting in increased mortality rates for women in these disadvantaged communities. Microwave based breast cancer detection has shown promise as a safer and less costly approach to early breast cancer detection. The goal of this research project is to build on our decade long experience in bed-based microwave radar-based breast imaging research to develop and test a portable microwave breast cancer detection device suitable for use in these communities. The system will incorporate an array of patch antennas; and a source of microwave radiation (generated by a collection of nano-VNA’s) operating in the 0.8-3.5 GHz range that can be swept across the breast to create a tomographic data set. The battery-powered system will be controlled using an advanced NVIDIA Jetson supercomputer and is designed to be operated by the patient herself; using an easy to understand graphical user interface; and will use Machine Learning to enable an immediate response as to the presence (or absence) of a significant breast abnormality. Previous simulations have shown that such approaches can achieve similar sensitivity and specificity to x-ray mammography. The machine learning approach will compare data from both breasts to enable reliable results for a range of breast sizes and densities and will be validated using an array of 3D printed breast phantoms of varied size and breast densities derived from MRI data. A robust breast microwave imaging system will provide a safe; comfortable; and affordable breast cancer screening; increasing access and reducing mortality for women in remote and low-income communities.,StephenPistorius,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-06,The student is required to be an independent learner with strong communication skills and a background in; Applied Physics; Electrical or Computer Engineering; or Computer Science.

33097,NUTRITION & CANCER,Le cancer du sein est le type de cancer le plus fréquemment diagnostiqué chez la femme et le deuxième plus meurtrier chez les Canadiennes. Si l'incidence de ce cancer continue d’augmenter; la mortalité qui lui est attribuable diminue; ce qui souligne l'importance du dépistage et des traitements. L’identification des facteurs de risque modifiables demeure donc grandement pertinente; non seulement pour la prévention de nouveaux cas; mais également pour augmenter les chances de survie. Jusqu'à présent; les études ont principalement porté sur l'évaluation de la contribution des facteurs individuels au risque de cancer du sein et tiennent rarement compte de l'alimentation dans sa globalité et de sa contribution à la capacité antioxydante totale. Plusieurs preuves épidémiologiques et expérimentales indiquent qu’une consommation excessive (mal équilibrée) de lipides alimentaires est un facteur de risque important dans l'étiologie du cancer du sein; probablement par le biais de l’augmentation du niveau de stress oxydatif. Mais les études prospectives réalisées n'ont pas toutes démontré une association entre les graisses alimentaires et le risque de cancer du sein. Ces résultats en apparence contradictoires peuvent être dus à plusieurs facteurs; dont certaines imprécisions dans les questionnaires de fréquence alimentaire et la possibilité que les effets observés dépendent du type d’acides gras contribuant à l'apport total en lipides et aussi aux apports en substances antioxydantes. Notre projet permettra la détermination des substrats à l’origine de la synthèse des radicaux libres et des molécules capables de s’opposer à ces effets lors du processus de la carcinogenèse mammaire.,SLIMANEBELBRAOUET,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,French,2024-05-01,Connaissances minimales au sujet de la relation entre le statut oxydants/antioxydants et les maladies chroniques,
33098,Text Summarization and Question Generation,Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web searches; news; advertisements; emails; customer services; language translations; radiology reports; social media; virtual assistants; conversational systems (chatbots); blogs; product comments; etc. I am interested in developing techniques for delivering information that is appropriate and relevant to the user; avoiding information overload and assisting informed decision making. This will lead to build up systems that on the one hand gist; synthesize and abstract information content from documents; and on the other hand capture user needs; intents; and preferences and generate customized; personalized documents. Text summarization and question generation are research directions for solving the information overload and the information fatigue problem. This will result in theories; technologies; and tools to help users obtain the information they need in a clear and useful way; leading to rich information use and efficient decision-making. Text summarization is a process of analyzing one or more documents; extracting the important information; compressing and condensing it; and presenting it in a concise; coherent and readable short text; according to the users' requests and needs. Users can grasp necessary information by reading the short summary generated; hence saving the reading time. Text summarization can be extractive or abstractive. The former is to select important sentences without changing the components of the original sentences; while the latter is to generate new sentences based on understanding; synthesizing; and abstracting the content of the documents. Question generation is a process of generating valid and fluent questions from a given text or passage. Question generation can be used in several scenarios; including reading comprehension; tutoring systems; search engine query suggestions; virtual assistants;,YlliasChali,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,Natural Language Processing (NLP) is concerned with concepts; models and algorithms to interpret; generate and learn natural languages; as well as applications of NLP.

33107,Quantum control of molecular qutrits,The novel field of Quantum Sensing exploits both the quantum mechanical behavior of atoms; molecules; and nanostructures ; and their exquisite sensitivity to external influences (such as external electric and magnetic fields). There are recent proposals for using high-spin magnetic molecules as candidates for quantum information processing because of the possibility of qutrit or qudit quantum computing. While qubits are based on two quantum states (or spin-1/2); qutrits are based on three quantum states (or spin-1). As opposed to N-qubits which allow for 2^N numbers; N-qutrits will allow 3^N numbers. In this project; the intern will be able to explore the differences between qubit and qutrit quantum control. Are there a set of universal quantum gates for qutrit quantum computing? How are qutrit computing protocols different from qubit protocols? What are the initialization requirements?

33112,Improving Personalized Learning with Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence,Recent advances in automation and machine learning would significantly reduce demand for many professions. As a result; most professions in the future would require constant learning and improving skills. With the tsunami of information that we have difficulties to process; understand and analyze; interactive courses that can automatically adapt to each person learning patterns and can deliver personalized content would be in high demand.

33113,Soft Wearable Haptic Devices using Magnetic Actuation,Advances in materials science; chemistry; mechanical engineering; and robotics engineering have brought soft actuators to interactive devices. A wide range of working principles have been used for developing soft actuators: pneumatics; hydraulics; electroactive polymers; acoustofluidics; electrorheological and magnetorheological fluids. However; current soft actuators possess several limitations which include: slow response; low/no force output; difficulty in precisely controlling them; or require high operating voltages with bulky control setups. Pneumatic actuators are commonly used in soft robotics because of their ability to generate large forces but they need high pressure; have low efficiency; are slow in response; and need noisy actuation valves. On the other hand; electrostatic actuators (e.g. dielectric elastomers) provide a high-frequency response but require thousands of volts with bulky control setups. This prohibits the use of these actuation principles in soft wearable settings. Recently electromagnetic actuation has been receiving a lot of attention because of its fast response; lower actuation voltage; and highly programmable and well-controlled movements. However; their deployment in interactive applications is not fully explored. Current state-of-the-art soft magnetic actuators in HCI are limited to low-resolution and enable only subtle vibration feedback. This project aims to develop high-resolution soft magnetic actuators that can deliver high force output and a variety of haptic sensations. By studying; simulating; and investigating novel device architectures; we aim to develop soft actuators that can be precisely controlled and programmed to open up new possibilities in AR/VR; Accessible computing; sports; and rehabilitation.,AdityaNittala,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,This project requires 1-2 students with a background in any one of the disciplines: Computer Science; Electronics and Electrical Engineering; Chemistry; Materials Engineering; or Mechatronics.

33114,Study of the physical and mechanical properties of black spruce and sugar maple wood treated with co-products of the dairy industry.,Wood is an abundant material on earth and has the ability to sequester carbon. In addition; wood is a biodegradable material. These properties make wood a material to be favoured over fossil fuels in the face of global warming. One of the major problems limiting the use of wood as a substitute for fossil-based materials is its ability to absorb and desorb moisture in relation to the relative humidity of the air around it. The absorption and desorption of moisture by wood causes variations in its dimensions; which can lead to cracks; and the presence of moisture in wood provides a living and reproduction environment for the micro-organisms that degrade it. To overcome this problem; reduce wood's capacity to absorb and desorb moisture in order to increase its dimensional stability and strengthen its resistance to micro-organisms; we have developed a new biobased technology that involves impregnating wood with a solution containing a biobased acid and whey ultrafiltration permeate and then heating the mixture to form polyesters (macromolecules) in the wood. These macromolecules formed in the wood will block the main moisture absorption sites in the wood. Measurements of dimensional stability; density; mechanical properties (hardness; modulus of elasticity; bending strength) and resistance to micro-organisms will be carried out to validate this new technology. We are interested in black spruce; sugar maple; trembling aspen and white pine; which are among the species that are abundant in Quebec; chosen for their economic importance; for outdoor and indoor uses; in order to extrapolate this new technology to all other species.,VéronicLandry,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The student must have a scientific background; such as chemistry; materials engineering; chemical engineering; or any other related field.

33115,Design and Fabrication of Multi-Modal Wearable Health Sensing Devices,Physiological sensors are recently receiving increasing attention in the broad field of computing. While long used in areas related to health and rehabilitation; we are now witnessing an impressive array of new applications in interactive computing. For instance; continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals informs athletes about their performance; monitoring of electrodermal activity (EDA) enhances computer-mediated emotional communication; and surface electromyography (sEMG) allows for gestural input. Despite these advances; designers seeking to develop new applications are confronted with serious restrictions at the level of the computer-body interface: commercial gel-based electrodes are non-conformal; problematic at body locations that deform; and neither ergonomic nor aesthetic to wear during everyday activities. Secondly; the current state-of-the-art physiological sensing devices can capture only a limited set of signals; typically restricted to electrophysiological signals (e.g. EMG; ECG; or other electrical signals). However; monitoring the electrolyte and metabolite concentration by measuring electrochemical activities in the body will present us with a higher level of granularity in determining the state of health. Sensing electrochemical signals can help in determining various vital signals such as blood glucose levels; blood-oxygen levels; characterization of sweat; etc. In this project; we will be developing novel wearable multi-modal health sensing devices that can not only capture the electrophysiological signals but also electrochemical signals. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and optimization techniques; this project aims to create highly optimized wearable health sensing devices. Another anticipated scientific contribution is the development of novel; widely-accessible; and low-cost fabrication techniques for creating these devices.

33118,Designing Open Educational Resources for Students to Engage as Biodiversity Scientists,Advancing knowledge and generating solutions to our current biodiversity crisis requires widespread participation. Efforts to engage students and community/citizen-scientists have led to increasing species observations and growing numbers of high quality publicly-available data. When scientists explore this data; new species have been discovered; changes in biodiversity have been identified; and the community has been mobilized to conserve local biodiversity. In our own courses; students have contributed observations of local plants and insects; and their work has identified rare and endangered species that require protection in Calgary. To effectively collaborate and utilize these increasing data to conserve biodiversity; it is especially important for students to now develop skills in finding; critically evaluating; visualizing; and sharing biodiversity information to multiple audiences.

33124,Detection of damage in concrete members and steel pipes using ultrasonics,Public agencies and society at-large face ongoing structural collapses of aging civil infrastructure because of lack of reliable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and non-intrusive techniques for condition assessment. NDE methods are faster and more practical and economical than traditional destructive methods; they are essential for the effective condition assessment of infrastructure.

33125,New regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome,Excessive or dysregulated inflammation contributes to the development and progression of numerous diseases including cancer; arthritis and atherosclerosis. If we can understand the fundamental signalling processes driving inflammation it may be possible to design new therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing inflammation and limiting disease progression. Recent work has indicated IRE1; a key mediator of the UPR; may also contribute to the formation of a protein complex called the NLRP3 inflammmasome. NLPR3 inflammasome assembly is a key pro-inflammatory event as it enables casaspe-1 activation; which in turn facilitates processing of pro-IL1b converting it from an inert pro-form to a highly potent bio-active cytokine. Active IL1b has been implicated in the progression of numerous diseases characterised by excessive inflammation. Therapeutic treatments; currently used; are targeted at blocking the effects of already activated IL1b however a better approach could be to limit caspase-1 activation by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. To determine the feasibility of such an approach we need to understand the signalling processes contributing to NLPR3 assembly and pro-caspase-1 processing. Recently; we have demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum anchored transmembrane receptor IRE1 contributes to structural assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome formation. We found that reducing IRE1 protein expression; via siRNA; or blocking IRE1 RNase activity; through the use of a small molecule inhibitor; reduced inflammasome assembly; caspase-1 activation and processing of pro-IL1b. As yet we do not understand exactly how IRE1 signalling contributes to assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this project we will dissect the signalling mechanisms downstream of IRE1 RNase activity and assess how they contribute to NLRP3 inflammasome formation. This project while contributing to our fundamental knowledge of IRE1 signalling will also test whether targeting IRE1 could be a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammation.,SusanLogue,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Preferably the student will have a background in cell or molecular biology.

33137,Coastal roads vulnerability, resilience, and recoverability in disasters - Vulnérabilité, résilience et capacité de récupération des routes côtières en cas de catastrophe,The St. Lawrence River; which links the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean; and its main tributaries form the basin around which most of Quebec's population is concentrated. The Quebec’s coastline is highly populated. About 80% of Quebec's population currently lives on the banks of the St. Lawrence and its tributaries. More than a third of the population of Québec maritime alone lives within 500 m of the shores of the St. Lawrence and more than 90% within 5 km. The St. Lawrence riverbanks are eroding; and the rate of erosion is expected to increase as climate change raises the sea level and more extreme climate conditions (e.g.; flooding). These threats the national roads along the Quebec`s coastline. Coastal developments must therefore take hazards into account and promote an approach based on understanding; mitigating and protecting against these risks.

33139,Investigating the impact of the unfolded protein response in triple negative breast cancer,In healthy cells the UPR provides a mechanism by which to restore cellular balance and return to normal functioning. If this is not possible the UPR triggers cell removal by instigating cell death. However; recent research has shown that cancer cells are different. Cancer cells permanently activate the UPR and harness its power as a way to ensure their survival and progression. How cancer cells rewire to sustain chronic UPR activation is not understood nor do we fully understand the broader impact of sustained UPR activation in cancer cells. This project will explore the impact of UPR signaling on the ability of cells to communicate with their surrounding environment. In other words; this project will investigate how the UPR helps stressed cells to “talk”. Using cell biology techniques; such as siRNA; the student will interfere with various components of UPR signaling in cancer cells and assess the impact of this on the production of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and chemokines. This project will help us understand how UPR activation impacts on the ability of a breast cancer cells to interact with and shape their surrounding environment. Techniques used will include tissue culture; siRNA and ELISA’s.,SusanLogue,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Preferably the student will have a background in cell or molecular biology.

33142,Smart Habit Tracker System to Decrease Stroke Risk,The project aim is to build a Smart Habit Tracker System / Health Coaching System that can track healthy habits and guide users (elders or users) by providing recommendations for habit changes on a continuous lifestyle basis to reduce stroke risk. Furthermore; early warning and response an imminent need for stroke risk management so there is a need to develop a Health-Coach system to track patients' habits; monitor stroke risk and alert clinicians if unhealthy habit can cause stroke risk levels to get high; thus decreasing first response time in stroke diagnosis. Methodology: stroke risk level is predicted by machine learning techniques; and then the XAI strategy is employed to get detailed insights into the factors that cause stroke in a patient. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) health coach component of the system recommends the users' habits that they can endeavor in order to reduce their stroke risk levels. The users would then use the habit tracker system to track these habits on a continuous basis for a period. They would then get a detailed report on how their stroke risk has changed over a period; resultantly decreasing stroke risk levels in an individual. Lastly; the system would enable Remote Health Coaching (RHC) feature wherein patients can use Smartwatch with integrated medical sensors to continuously monitor their vitals in real-time and the machine learning model would simultaneously predict the stroke risk; if the stroke risk reaches concerning levels; the users and clinicians would be alerted to take the necessary course of action. Significance: This health-coaching framework can help patients in decreasing the risk for stroke and hence act as a stroke prevention approach for users. It can help guide users to inform them about their health condition and help them manage their stroke risk by tracking their habits and stroke,YASHENG (Yasin)MAIMAITIJIANG (Mamatjan),British Columbia,Thompson Rivers University,English,2024-05-20,Basic background in Explainable AI.
