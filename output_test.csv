31835,Machine learning for functional genomics and protein engineering applications,Such tools can be useful for the assignment of improved functions for orphan genes and sequences for orphan enzymes and for investigating enzyme promiscuity. Hence; there is the potential for the use of new protein language modeling representations using embeddings from natural language. Such improved protein language modeling methods can be valuable for multiple applications including optimizing protein solubility; stability; along with other functional properties of the enzymes such as catalytic activity and affinity. Finally; such protein language modeling methods will be valuable to engineer novel enzymes by combining it with existing experimental techniques such as directed evolution.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology; biochemistry and machine learning. The undergraduate program can be in computer science of engineering and the student will have experience with bioinformatics and genome sequence analysis. The student must be willing to learning techniques and work with senior researchers in order to execute new ideas and algorithms into code and test them out. Finally; the student should be comfortable programming in Python and familiarity with Pytorch and developing code for GPUs.,Preferred student academic background
