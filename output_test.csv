31835,Machine learning for functional genomics and protein engineering applications,Such tools can be useful for the assignment of improved functions for orphan genes and sequences for orphan enzymes and for investigating enzyme promiscuity. Hence; there is the potential for the use of new protein language modeling representations using embeddings from natural language. Such improved protein language modeling methods can be valuable for multiple applications including optimizing protein solubility; stability; along with other functional properties of the enzymes such as catalytic activity and affinity. Finally; such protein language modeling methods will be valuable to engineer novel enzymes by combining it with existing experimental techniques such as directed evolution.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31836,Synthetic Biology for Metabolic Engineering of Chemicals from Biomass-based Feedstocks,Further; increased volatility in the petrochemical feedstocks has necessitated a paradigm shift towards the use of biomass based feedstocks for the synthesis of transportation fuels. Consequently; there have been intense academic and corporate research efforts for the design of microbial strains for the production of ethanol; butanol; fatty acid methyl esters and isoprenoids as biofuels. In contrast; there have been very few instances of microbial strain engineering for large-scale commodity chemicals with the exception of 1;3 propanediol (DuPont); lactic acid (Cargill); and 1;4 butanediol (Genomatica). A common feature among all of these chemicals is that they are derived primarily from central metabolism. The success of these efforts clearly motivates the microbial strain engineering efforts for other chemicals which are further removed from central metabolism. Recently; the U.S. Department of Energy identified a dozen chemicals with large market demands globally and in North America that could be potentially synthesized from biomass-based feedstocks. These include dicarboxylic acids such as succinic; malic; fumaric; itaconic and adipic acids as well as levulinic acid. In the case of chemicals that are derived from central metabolism such as succinic acid; malic and fumaric acid; metabolic pathways and enzymes for their synthesis are found in typical industrially used hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However; there still remains the challenge of engineering the metabolism of the microbial host so that volumetric productivity; titer; and product yield can be improved for economic viability. In contrast; for chemicals such as adipic acid; the synthesis pathways are not present in typical industrial hosts resulting in an additional challenge for strain engineering. One of the challenges to developing bioconversion technologies for the production of biochemicals is attaining high conversion efficiency from variable sugar streams. A primary goal is to use systems biology methods to design strains.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31837,Modulating immune response in tumors via nanoparticle drug delivery,Tumor cells secret growth factors; cytokines and chemokines to drive the immune response in the tumor microenvironment towards pro-inflammatory; promoting tumor invasion and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Immuno-modulation of the tumor microenvironment is an attractive strategy for antitumor therapy; but systemic delivery of immunomodulating agents often results in severe side effects. The Li lab plans to develop a nanoparticle system to target an immunomodulating agent to the tumor to re-educate the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that this strategy will reduce the side effects; while exert enhanced anti-tumor immunity.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31838,Genome editing using non-viral nanoparticle delivery,Gene editing provides an alternative treatment for diseases that cannot be cured by conventional therapies. Those challenging diseases include cancer; genetic disorders; and viral infection. The limiting step for gene editing is efficient delivery of genome editing components into the target cells. The delivery system needs to overcome various barriers and release the biological payloads in the target site. The major delivery barriers include rapid enzymatic degradation; renal elimination; efficient uptake by the target cells and release in the desirable subcellular compartment for optimal effect. The Li lab focuses on developing innovative nanoparticle delivery systems that provide stable and efficient encapsulation of gene editing components and target them to specific cells. Ultimately; these nanoparticles will be used to treat genetic disorders in both in vitro and in vivo models.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31839,Anti-cancer drug design,This project would involve working on one of our cancer drug design and synthesis campaigns. With our partners; we have identified promising new proteins that could be targeted to treat cancer. We have designed new molecules using structural biology and computational chemistry techniques; and are making many new drugs based on this screen. These often have new ring systems and scaffolds that are not found in the literature and we must invent new chemistry to effectively make them. These drugs are then evaluated by our research team in the lab; and we iteratively redesign; and make new generations of the molecules. The project here is for the organic synthesis. If you have wanted to do synthesis for medicinal chemistry; this is the perfect project for you. Unlike most traditional medicinal chemistry; we are not making a lot of similar analogues; we are generating a few more complex scaffolds which we may then derivatize for standard lead exploration.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31840,Computational-guided drug design,We are driven by using chemistry to solve questions that arise in biomedicine. This often takes the form of medicinal chemistry where we are looking to make drugs to target specific diseases. As making molecules is expensive; we are using a target-oriented design strategy where we use a combination of structural biology and computational chemistry to study how known molecules interact with a protein target. We are currently using this approach on 7 different targets ranging from new cancer drugs; to autoimmune peptides; to treatments to neutralize antibiotic-resistant bacteria; COVID-19 reasearch; to studying cannabis-protein interactions to better understand the effects of the disease.We then design new molecules based on this information and do computational high-throughput screening to examine which ones we should make in the lab. Computationally; we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations; docking studies; quantum mechanical modelling; and advanced DFT-derived techniques and measurements to understand how molecules interact one with another. We use Gaussian; Amber; Gromacs; Schrodinger; Materials Studio; Rosetta; Autodock Vina and other tools to carry out these analyses. We have extensive supercomputing infrastructure to run these calculations (3600 computer cores); and access to many of the fastest graphics cards for the molecular modelling. The student will be working with the team on one of these projects; all of which have the potential of transforming how we treat disease.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31841,Macrocyclic Single Molecule Sensors as Diagnostic Tools,We have become very involved in supramolecular chemistry; the chemistry involved when non-covalent bonds provide well-defined structures. We are primarily interested in adapting synthetic chemistry to make previously inaccessible structures with novel activity. This is part of an extensive collaboration with teams in the US; Finland and Switzerland. The project combines developing and using new synthetic organic chemistry with the potential for biophysical and analytical chemistry; or computational and/or materials science training depending on the interests of the applicant. The work will primarily involve the functionalization of aryl groups; post-macrocylization functionalization and elaboration of pillararenes and resorcinarenes. We are then using these for a variety of really neat applications including detecting disease specific molecules (Chemical Science; 2018; 9; 1358-1367); looking to create tools to prevent bacterial growth; and making fundamental discoveries in how molecules form bonds to make large supramoleuclar networks either as crystals (Crystal Growth and Design; 2018; 18; 513-520) or in solution. We are moving into using these systems in live animal models; and in lab-on-a-chip set-ups. The project is a perfect example of our program's philosophy of using synthetic organic chemistry to do more than only total synthesis.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31842,Functional Polymers: Towards highly targeted traceless drug delivery,Self-immolative polymers are degradable polymers whose decomposition needs to be triggered-they are perfectly stable plastics until a specific stimulus is applied. They are different from traditional biodegradable polymers in that degradation takes place in hours rather than months. Our research team is developing a biocompatible scaffold with a high degree of functionalizability that gives our polymers a unique practical flexibility for use in a wide variety of biomedical applications with our partners including drug delivery; diagnostics; medical device preparation; early cancer detection; and for the development of highly innovative "animal-free" assays. This particular project is focused on novel chemistries that will allow for our biocompatible scaffolds to be used in novel drug-delivery applications. We are working towards producing "unbreachable" nano-particles that are completely stable to all conditions except a single target enzyme that is upregulated in certain cancers. The project involves a combination of synthetic chemistry; materials science; bioimaging; and potentially mammalian tissue culture for a highly interdisciplinary experience. This project is advancing very rapidly in our group; and is a highly innovative and competitive research space; and so the exact project will only be decided upon when the student arrives and we agree upon a subject of mutual interest and relevance.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31843,3D bioprinting tissues from stem cells,3D printing uses the specifications provided in a digital file to construct 3 dimensional objects and this process can be applied as a method to engineer tissues. The goal of this project is to use biomaterial-based bioinks to print functional 3D neural tissue from stem cells using 3D bioprinting. In particular; we wish to print tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hiPSCs are pluripotent stem cells produced by reprogramming adult cells back into a state where they can form any type of tissue. hiPSC lines derived from a patient could be printed into tissues used for screening potential treatments for their disease. Proper conditions must be met to ensure the printed hiPSCs form the desired type of tissue. During the printing process; cells are contained in "bioink"; the material that surrounds the cells and enables them to be delivered in continuous streams. This project will bioprint tissues from hiPSCs and evaluate their properties. Such engineered tissues could serve as a tool for drug screening.,Stephanie Willerth,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-06,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31844,Analytical chemistry in whisky and/or cannabis science,The Trant group has multiple active collaborations with industrial partners in the wine; whisky; and cannabis fields. The research involves the analysis of components in ingredients; products; and mid-process materials to assist our industrial partners in providing the best possible product with the lowest amount of waste. This research project will involve working directly with our internal analytical chemistry team; and using both internal Trant Team instrumentation and instrumentation located in the Windsor Wine lab (Founding Director: Dr. John Trant) to develop new methodologies to study the levels of cannabinoids; oak-derived flavour compounds in whisky; and wine-flavour compounds and markers of oxidation using HPLC; GC-MS; LC-MS-MS and MS as well as by IR; turbidity; density; and through analysis by refractometry. The research also involves the compiling of reports; discussions with industrial partners; and learning about sample management. The project also could extend; depending on the interests of the candidate; into natural products chemistry; including the development of new non-chromatographic purification methodologies; and some semi-synthesis of standards; or of analogues of known compounds.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engg-Chemical, Engg-Biomedical, Engg-Biological, Engg-Industrial
31845,Acetal-free carbohydrates,Carbohydrates are everywhere. Biology uses them as intermediate duration signals; and their half lives vary from a few hours to almost a day. However; this can often be too short for therapeutics like vaccines. Certain carbohydrates are expressed almost uniquely on the surface of cancer cells. If the immune system could be engaged to target these carbohydrates; it could be used to selectively attack cancer. Unfortunately; natural carbohydrates have failed to elicit such a response. The Trant Team is making unnatural versions of these carbohydrates that lack the acetal linkage and thus have a much longer lifetime in the body. These molecules may be able to succeed where the natural versions have failed. This project is focused on the complicated synthesis of these molecules; the development of new chemistry to attach these non-carbohydrates together; the development of novel display scaffolds to maximize their visibility to the immune system; and the evaluation of these materials for immunologic activity.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,Chemistry
31846,Transforming the Field Education Landscape: Intersections of Research and Practice in Canadian Social Work Field Education,The goal of this talent Project is to integrate research and practice in the preparation of the next generation of social workers by developing partnered research training initiatives; both within academia and across the public and not-for-profit sectors; that enhance student and trainee research practice knowledge and applied skill development. The objectives of the Project are: 1) To transform social work field education by bridging the gap between research and practice through joint training initiatives; projects and other forms of multi-stakeholder engagement and integration; 2) To strengthen the recognition of the importance of social work practice research by enhancing knowledge and skills among students; postdoctoral fellows; and current and future practitioners; 3) To train and mentor students and postdoctoral fellows through new partnered research training initiatives that build the research capacity of the current and future generation of social work scholars; practitioners and policymakers; 4) To support the development of sustainable models of field education through engaging students and postdoctoral fellows in research on promising practices in social work field education across Canada; 5) To engage students and postdoctoral fellows in partnered knowledge mobilization and the multi-directional exchange of knowledge in Canada and internationally on promising practices for sustainable field education and practice research.,JulieDrolet,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,,Chemistry
31847,Soft robot modeling and design,Design a soft robot of interest (hand; dog; etc.) to mimic real anatomy using compliance mechanisms; 3D print it with elastomers; test and improve the design.,Tsz HoKwok,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,,Chemistry
31848,Environment modelling and path planning for industrial AGVs,Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are intensively used in many industrial sectors and for numerous and diverse applications. In this context; automated and optimized path planning of AGV has been a very important subject of research for the last years. Automated path planning for AGV starts with modelling the static environment in which the vehicle is likely to move and operate. Various 2D and 3D representations may be applied for modelling such environments; among which point clouds; classical CAD representations; grids; quadtrees; octrees; classical structured and unstructured discretizations; etc. In a second step; the static model of the environment needs to be transformed and adapted for applying classical path planning algorithms. Moreover; modelling the environment needs to be adapted and updated to take into account different types of dynamic obstacles (humans; other automated or human operated vehicles; etc.). The types of models used for representing static and dynamic environments are strongly dependent on the application context (type of environment; type of vehicle; applications and tasks targeted; speed; accuracy required; security issues; etc.). In this context; the research work of our team is focused on developing optimal strategies and methods; in a specific application context; aimed at modelling static and dynamic environments for AGV path planning.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,,Chemistry
31849,Integration of Optimization with Computer Aided Design,The development of Topology Optimization Methods (TOM) in 3D has been a very important subject of research for the last years. These methods are aimed at automating the process of design optimization and thus; they are based on applying analysis iterations on 3D geometries that are automatically modified throughout these iterations. The next step in the development of TOM is its integration within CAD platforms. Ideally the process should start from an initial CAD model along with boundary conditions (BCs) and optimization objectives; and automatically end with an optimized CAD model that fulfills these objectives; all of this without any other user interaction. This integration faces many challenges among which discriminating non-design material (material that should not be affected by the optimization process) and design material (material that is to be affected by the optimization process). We have developed our own TOM research platform and the integration of TOM within CAD uses the FEM for analysis and the SIMP method as the optimization method. Input of the overall optimization process is composed with an initial part; represented as a STEP file (along with BCs) and a second STEP file is used to represent non-design material. From this input data; the optimization process is fully automated and it results in an optimized shape. The SIMP method is used as the optimization method in itself; which is a classical scheme that has been adapted for the context of 3D optimization. It basically updates a density field throughout the initial design domain along FEA iterations in order to generate an optimal material distribution. It is worth noting that this project has a connection with a second project proposed by our team. Indeed; this project is focused on input of the optimization process while the other one is focused on output.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,,Chemistry
31850,Modelling the microstructures of heterogeneous materials,With recent progress about CAD and numerical simulation; studying mechanical and thermal properties of heterogeneous materials can be performed virtually. Numerical simulation of heterogeneous materials is indeed of great interest to the scientific community since it is an attractive and economical solution to the problem of characterizing the thermomechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials. This requires setting up and automating the generation of detailed models of materials microtructures. Our team (équipe de recherche en intégration CAO-Calcul or ERICCA) at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières has developped a platform for that; which is maily based on using solid modelling techniques along with finite element analysis. This platform is originally oriented towards studying heterogeneous particulate materials; but can be applied to all types of microstructures.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,,Chemistry
31851,High-performance practical blockchain systems,This is a multi-faceted project on improving core blockchain components in order to improve its performance. Students will be in charge of investigating one or more aspects of blockchains; formulating novel problems; designing; implementing; and evaluating their solution. The objectives of this project include the following. Note that students are expected to choose a subset of goals to fulfill: 1- Investigate relevant blockchain use cases in the public and private sectors; identify suitable blockchain platforms; and develop Proof-of-Concept applications. This includes: cryptocurrencies; NFTs; supply chain traceability; etc. 2- Develop and improve upon existing consensus algorithms; such as Proof-of-Work; PBFT; to support more peers; provide a higher transaction throughput; and deliver predictable commit times. 3- Improve the blockchain data structure (e.g.; Merkle tree) for fast insertion; querying; and compressibility. Propose new blockchain structures (e.g.; tree) with increased transaction parallelism. 4- Propose a data structure for storing off-chain information; with on-chain verification mechanisms; and a dynamic algorithm for offloading data. 5- Study the effect of networking on blockchain commit time; resilience to attacks; and fork rate. Develop networking protocols for enhanced performance. 6- Create blockchain middleware; delivering reusable services in a reliable and safe manner; such as messaging; identity management; replication; etc.,KaiwenZhang,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-01,,Chemistry
31853,Structured Derivative-free Optimization,This project will explore method to approximate derivatives; gradient; Hessians; and other variational analysis objects in the framework of derivative-free optimization. Further steps will consider methods to apply such approximations in algorithm design and solving simulation-based problems from real-world applications.,WarrenHare,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,,Chemistry
31854,Anti-aging properties and anti-diabetic properties of cannabis and magic mushroom extracts,The research project focuses on the effect of single cannabinoids; psilocybin; cannabis extracts and extracts of magic mushrooms on aging and metabolic syndrome/diabetes. We are using single cell (skin epithelial cells; fibroblasts; beta-cells); 3D tissue (full sickness skin tissues) and animal (mice) models to analyze the effect of aforementioned treatments. We will induce aging with the exposure to hydrogen peroxide; UVC or high glucose/high lipid addition. We will induce metabolic pre-diabetic effects by exposing cells/tissues/animals to high fat/high sugar diet. We will then test the induction of conditions by analyzing the cell survival; cell morphology; RT-PCR and Western blots and then treat with various formulations of aforementioned drugs. We will evaluate the results and select specific formulations for animal studies.,IgorKovalchuk,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-20,,Chemistry
31855,Investigating the structure and function of regulators of the human autophagy degradation pathway,Autophagy is a multi-step degradation process that involves sequestration of cytoplasmic material into a transport vesicle called the autophagosome and the subsequent fusion of this autophagosome to the lysosome where the contents would be degraded by digestive enzymes inside this cellular "incinerator". The different steps of autophagy are mediated by a specialized suite of autophagy regulatory proteins and protein complexes. The proposed research project focuses on a human autophagy factor known as EPG5. EPG5 has been proposed to mediate the specific fusion between the autophagosome and the lysosome but the mechanism of action of EPG5 is not fully understood. Clinical genetics studies revealed that mutations to the gene encoding EPG5 causes a severe multi system disorder known as Vici syndrome. Although many of these mutations have now been mapped; how these genetic alterations affect the function of EPG5 is not known. The Yip laboratory recently developed a high-yield method to isolate pure EPG5 and this has enabled more comprehensive biochemical and molecular characterization of this very large-sized (~290kDa) protein. The proposed project will harness this powerful experimental platform and will specifically focus on examining the effects of various Vici syndrome disease mutations on the biochemical property and function of EPG5 using protein biochemistry; biophysical; and cell biology approaches.,CalvinYip,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,,Chemistry
