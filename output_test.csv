31835,Machine learning for functional genomics and protein engineering applications,Such tools can be useful for the assignment of improved functions for orphan genes and sequences for orphan enzymes and for investigating enzyme promiscuity. Hence; there is the potential for the use of new protein language modeling representations using embeddings from natural language. Such improved protein language modeling methods can be valuable for multiple applications including optimizing protein solubility; stability; along with other functional properties of the enzymes such as catalytic activity and affinity. Finally; such protein language modeling methods will be valuable to engineer novel enzymes by combining it with existing experimental techniques such as directed evolution.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology; biochemistry and machine learning. The undergraduate program can be in computer science of engineering and the student will have experience with bioinformatics and genome sequence analysis. The student must be willing to learning techniques and work with senior researchers in order to execute new ideas and algorithms into code and test them out. Finally; the student should be comfortable programming in Python and familiarity with Pytorch and developing code for GPUs.,None
31836,Synthetic Biology for Metabolic Engineering of Chemicals from Biomass-based Feedstocks,Further; increased volatility in the petrochemical feedstocks has necessitated a paradigm shift towards the use of biomass based feedstocks for the synthesis of transportation fuels. Consequently; there have been intense academic and corporate research efforts for the design of microbial strains for the production of ethanol; butanol; fatty acid methyl esters and isoprenoids as biofuels. In contrast; there have been very few instances of microbial strain engineering for large-scale commodity chemicals with the exception of 1;3 propanediol (DuPont); lactic acid (Cargill); and 1;4 butanediol (Genomatica). A common feature among all of these chemicals is that they are derived primarily from central metabolism. The success of these efforts clearly motivates the microbial strain engineering efforts for other chemicals which are further removed from central metabolism. Recently; the U.S. Department of Energy identified a dozen chemicals with large market demands globally and in North America that could be potentially synthesized from biomass-based feedstocks. These include dicarboxylic acids such as succinic; malic; fumaric; itaconic and adipic acids as well as levulinic acid. In the case of chemicals that are derived from central metabolism such as succinic acid; malic and fumaric acid; metabolic pathways and enzymes for their synthesis are found in typical industrially used hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However; there still remains the challenge of engineering the metabolism of the microbial host so that volumetric productivity; titer; and product yield can be improved for economic viability. In contrast; for chemicals such as adipic acid; the synthesis pathways are not present in typical industrial hosts resulting in an additional challenge for strain engineering. One of the challenges to developing bioconversion technologies for the production of biochemicals is attaining high conversion efficiency from variable sugar streams. A primary goal is to use systems biology methods to design strains.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Student should be trained in engineering (e.g.; chemical or biochemical engineering) with basic knowledge of biochemistry. He should also know the basics of mathematical modeling and being able to program in MATLAB or Fortran is a plus. Knowledge of bioinformatics is a major plus. Basic experimental skills and interest in learning molecular biology and analytical chemistry tools and other advanced synthetic biology techniques will be a plus.,None
31837,Modulating immune response in tumors via nanoparticle drug delivery,Tumor cells secret growth factors; cytokines and chemokines to drive the immune response in the tumor microenvironment towards pro-inflammatory; promoting tumor invasion and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Immuno-modulation of the tumor microenvironment is an attractive strategy for antitumor therapy; but systemic delivery of immunomodulating agents often results in severe side effects. The Li lab plans to develop a nanoparticle system to target an immunomodulating agent to the tumor to re-educate the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that this strategy will reduce the side effects; while exert enhanced anti-tumor immunity.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,1.

Microsoft Office (Powerpoint; Excel; Word),None
31838,Genome editing using non-viral nanoparticle delivery,Gene editing provides an alternative treatment for diseases that cannot be cured by conventional therapies. Those challenging diseases include cancer; genetic disorders; and viral infection. The limiting step for gene editing is efficient delivery of genome editing components into the target cells. The delivery system needs to overcome various barriers and release the biological payloads in the target site. The major delivery barriers include rapid enzymatic degradation; renal elimination; efficient uptake by the target cells and release in the desirable subcellular compartment for optimal effect. The Li lab focuses on developing innovative nanoparticle delivery systems that provide stable and efficient encapsulation of gene editing components and target them to specific cells. Ultimately; these nanoparticles will be used to treat genetic disorders in both in vitro and in vivo models.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,1. Background in drug delivery; pharmaceutics or chemical engineering (e.g. courses or summer project) 2. Cell culture 3. Molecular biology assays; such as qPCR; Western blot 4. English proficiency 5. Microsoft Office (Powerpoint; Excel; Word),None
31839,Anti-cancer drug design,This project would involve working on one of our cancer drug design and synthesis campaigns. With our partners; we have identified promising new proteins that could be targeted to treat cancer. We have designed new molecules using structural biology and computational chemistry techniques; and are making many new drugs based on this screen. These often have new ring systems and scaffolds that are not found in the literature and we must invent new chemistry to effectively make them. These drugs are then evaluated by our research team in the lab; and we iteratively redesign; and make new generations of the molecules. The project here is for the organic synthesis. If you have wanted to do synthesis for medicinal chemistry; this is the perfect project for you. Unlike most traditional medicinal chemistry; we are not making a lot of similar analogues; we are generating a few more complex scaffolds which we may then derivatize for standard lead exploration.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,None
31840,Computational-guided drug design,We are driven by using chemistry to solve questions that arise in biomedicine. This often takes the form of medicinal chemistry where we are looking to make drugs to target specific diseases. As making molecules is expensive; we are using a target-oriented design strategy where we use a combination of structural biology and computational chemistry to study how known molecules interact with a protein target. We are currently using this approach on 7 different targets ranging from new cancer drugs; to autoimmune peptides; to treatments to neutralize antibiotic-resistant bacteria; COVID-19 reasearch; to studying cannabis-protein interactions to better understand the effects of the disease.We then design new molecules based on this information and do computational high-throughput screening to examine which ones we should make in the lab. Computationally; we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations; docking studies; quantum mechanical modelling; and advanced DFT-derived techniques and measurements to understand how molecules interact one with another. We use Gaussian; Amber; Gromacs; Schrodinger; Materials Studio; Rosetta; Autodock Vina and other tools to carry out these analyses. We have extensive supercomputing infrastructure to run these calculations (3600 computer cores); and access to many of the fastest graphics cards for the molecular modelling. The student will be working with the team on one of these projects; all of which have the potential of transforming how we treat disease.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a computational chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The student should have some familiarity with computational chemistry before arriving; but can be taught any of the software they will need. The specific project to be undertaken will be selected both based on the interests and capabilities of the student. Unlike any other MITACS project; the student can continue to collaborate on the science after returning to their home country if they wish. The student will also; ideally; be interested in continuing their studies in graduate school in computational chemistry.,None
31841,Macrocyclic Single Molecule Sensors as Diagnostic Tools,We have become very involved in supramolecular chemistry; the chemistry involved when non-covalent bonds provide well-defined structures. We are primarily interested in adapting synthetic chemistry to make previously inaccessible structures with novel activity. This is part of an extensive collaboration with teams in the US; Finland and Switzerland. The project combines developing and using new synthetic organic chemistry with the potential for biophysical and analytical chemistry; or computational and/or materials science training depending on the interests of the applicant. The work will primarily involve the functionalization of aryl groups; post-macrocylization functionalization and elaboration of pillararenes and resorcinarenes. We are then using these for a variety of really neat applications including detecting disease specific molecules (Chemical Science; 2018; 9; 1358-1367); looking to create tools to prevent bacterial growth; and making fundamental discoveries in how molecules form bonds to make large supramoleuclar networks either as crystals (Crystal Growth and Design; 2018; 18; 513-520) or in solution. We are moving into using these systems in live animal models; and in lab-on-a-chip set-ups. The project is a perfect example of our program's philosophy of using synthetic organic chemistry to do more than only total synthesis.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,None
31842,Functional Polymers: Towards highly targeted traceless drug delivery,Self-immolative polymers are degradable polymers whose decomposition needs to be triggered-they are perfectly stable plastics until a specific stimulus is applied. They are different from traditional biodegradable polymers in that degradation takes place in hours rather than months. Our research team is developing a biocompatible scaffold with a high degree of functionalizability that gives our polymers a unique practical flexibility for use in a wide variety of biomedical applications with our partners including drug delivery; diagnostics; medical device preparation; early cancer detection; and for the development of highly innovative "animal-free" assays. This particular project is focused on novel chemistries that will allow for our biocompatible scaffolds to be used in novel drug-delivery applications. We are working towards producing "unbreachable" nano-particles that are completely stable to all conditions except a single target enzyme that is upregulated in certain cancers. The project involves a combination of synthetic chemistry; materials science; bioimaging; and potentially mammalian tissue culture for a highly interdisciplinary experience. This project is advancing very rapidly in our group; and is a highly innovative and competitive research space; and so the exact project will only be decided upon when the student arrives and we agree upon a subject of mutual interest and relevance.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science.

31843,3D bioprinting tissues from stem cells,3D printing uses the specifications provided in a digital file to construct 3 dimensional objects and this process can be applied as a method to engineer tissues. The goal of this project is to use biomaterial-based bioinks to print functional 3D neural tissue from stem cells using 3D bioprinting. In particular; we wish to print tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hiPSCs are pluripotent stem cells produced by reprogramming adult cells back into a state where they can form any type of tissue. hiPSC lines derived from a patient could be printed into tissues used for screening potential treatments for their disease. Proper conditions must be met to ensure the printed hiPSCs form the desired type of tissue. During the printing process; cells are contained in "bioink"; the material that surrounds the cells and enables them to be delivered in continuous streams. This project will bioprint tissues from hiPSCs and evaluate their properties. Such engineered tissues could serve as a tool for drug screening.,Stephanie Willerth,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-06,Stem cell culture experience is preferred. Experience working with chemicals and biohazards along with experience immunohistochemistry; real time PCR; and flow cytometry would also be desirable.,None
31844,Analytical chemistry in whisky and/or cannabis science,The Trant group has multiple active collaborations with industrial partners in the wine; whisky; and cannabis fields. The research involves the analysis of components in ingredients; products; and mid-process materials to assist our industrial partners in providing the best possible product with the lowest amount of waste. This research project will involve working directly with our internal analytical chemistry team; and using both internal Trant Team instrumentation and instrumentation located in the Windsor Wine lab (Founding Director: Dr. John Trant) to develop new methodologies to study the levels of cannabinoids; oak-derived flavour compounds in whisky; and wine-flavour compounds and markers of oxidation using HPLC; GC-MS; LC-MS-MS and MS as well as by IR; turbidity; density; and through analysis by refractometry. The research also involves the compiling of reports; discussions with industrial partners; and learning about sample management. The project also could extend; depending on the interests of the candidate; into natural products chemistry; including the development of new non-chromatographic purification methodologies; and some semi-synthesis of standards; or of analogues of known compounds.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,,None
31845,Acetal-free carbohydrates,Carbohydrates are everywhere. Biology uses them as intermediate duration signals; and their half lives vary from a few hours to almost a day. However; this can often be too short for therapeutics like vaccines. Certain carbohydrates are expressed almost uniquely on the surface of cancer cells. If the immune system could be engaged to target these carbohydrates; it could be used to selectively attack cancer. Unfortunately; natural carbohydrates have failed to elicit such a response. The Trant Team is making unnatural versions of these carbohydrates that lack the acetal linkage and thus have a much longer lifetime in the body. These molecules may be able to succeed where the natural versions have failed. This project is focused on the complicated synthesis of these molecules; the development of new chemistry to attach these non-carbohydrates together; the development of novel display scaffolds to maximize their visibility to the immune system; and the evaluation of these materials for immunologic activity.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,None
31846,Transforming the Field Education Landscape: Intersections of Research and Practice in Canadian Social Work Field Education,The goal of this talent Project is to integrate research and practice in the preparation of the next generation of social workers by developing partnered research training initiatives; both within academia and across the public and not-for-profit sectors; that enhance student and trainee research practice knowledge and applied skill development. The objectives of the Project are: 1) To transform social work field education by bridging the gap between research and practice through joint training initiatives; projects and other forms of multi-stakeholder engagement and integration; 2) To strengthen the recognition of the importance of social work practice research by enhancing knowledge and skills among students; postdoctoral fellows; and current and future practitioners; 3) To train and mentor students and postdoctoral fellows through new partnered research training initiatives that build the research capacity of the current and future generation of social work scholars; practitioners and policymakers; 4) To support the development of sustainable models of field education through engaging students and postdoctoral fellows in research on promising practices in social work field education across Canada; 5) To engage students and postdoctoral fellows in partnered knowledge mobilization and the multi-directional exchange of knowledge in Canada and internationally on promising practices for sustainable field education and practice research.,JulieDrolet,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,The students are required to have excellent writing and communication skills; an interest in qualitative; mixed methods research; skills in reviewing; compiling and analyzing relevant literature; the ability to work independently or with others; and strong computer skills (Microsoft Word; PowerPoint; Excel; online communication tools).

31848,Environment modelling and path planning for industrial AGVs,Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are intensively used in many industrial sectors and for numerous and diverse applications. In this context; automated and optimized path planning of AGV has been a very important subject of research for the last years. Automated path planning for AGV starts with modelling the static environment in which the vehicle is likely to move and operate. Various 2D and 3D representations may be applied for modelling such environments; among which point clouds; classical CAD representations; grids; quadtrees; octrees; classical structured and unstructured discretizations; etc. In a second step; the static model of the environment needs to be transformed and adapted for applying classical path planning algorithms. Moreover; modelling the environment needs to be adapted and updated to take into account different types of dynamic obstacles (humans; other automated or human operated vehicles; etc.). The types of models used for representing static and dynamic environments are strongly dependent on the application context (type of environment; type of vehicle; applications and tasks targeted; speed; accuracy required; security issues; etc.). In this context; the research work of our team is focused on developing optimal strategies and methods; in a specific application context; aimed at modelling static and dynamic environments for AGV path planning.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,Background in engineering and computer science.

31849,Integration of Optimization with Computer Aided Design,The development of Topology Optimization Methods (TOM) in 3D has been a very important subject of research for the last years. These methods are aimed at automating the process of design optimization and thus; they are based on applying analysis iterations on 3D geometries that are automatically modified throughout these iterations. The next step in the development of TOM is its integration within CAD platforms. Ideally the process should start from an initial CAD model along with boundary conditions (BCs) and optimization objectives; and automatically end with an optimized CAD model that fulfills these objectives; all of this without any other user interaction. This integration faces many challenges among which discriminating non-design material (material that should not be affected by the optimization process) and design material (material that is to be affected by the optimization process). We have developed our own TOM research platform and the integration of TOM within CAD uses the FEM for analysis and the SIMP method as the optimization method. Input of the overall optimization process is composed with an initial part; represented as a STEP file (along with BCs) and a second STEP file is used to represent non-design material. From this input data; the optimization process is fully automated and it results in an optimized shape. The SIMP method is used as the optimization method in itself; which is a classical scheme that has been adapted for the context of 3D optimization. It basically updates a density field throughout the initial design domain along FEA iterations in order to generate an optimal material distribution. It is worth noting that this project has a connection with a second project proposed by our team. Indeed; this project is focused on input of the optimization process while the other one is focused on output.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,Background in engineering or computer science. Interest and knowledge in computer programming; 3D geometric modeling and computer aided design. Knowledge of Linux OS and would be considered as a plus.,None
31850,Modelling the microstructures of heterogeneous materials,With recent progress about CAD and numerical simulation; studying mechanical and thermal properties of heterogeneous materials can be performed virtually. Numerical simulation of heterogeneous materials is indeed of great interest to the scientific community since it is an attractive and economical solution to the problem of characterizing the thermomechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials. This requires setting up and automating the generation of detailed models of materials microtructures. Our team (équipe de recherche en intégration CAO-Calcul or ERICCA) at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières has developped a platform for that; which is maily based on using solid modelling techniques along with finite element analysis. This platform is originally oriented towards studying heterogeneous particulate materials; but can be applied to all types of microstructures.,Jean-ChristopheCuillière,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,English,2024-05-06,Background in engineering or computer science. Interest and knowledge in computer programming; 3D geometric modeling and computer aided design. Knowledge of Linux OS and would be considered as a plus.,None

31854,Anti-aging properties and anti-diabetic properties of cannabis and magic mushroom extracts,The research project focuses on the effect of single cannabinoids; psilocybin; cannabis extracts and extracts of magic mushrooms on aging and metabolic syndrome/diabetes. We are using single cell (skin epithelial cells; fibroblasts; beta-cells); 3D tissue (full sickness skin tissues) and animal (mice) models to analyze the effect of aforementioned treatments. We will induce aging with the exposure to hydrogen peroxide; UVC or high glucose/high lipid addition. We will induce metabolic pre-diabetic effects by exposing cells/tissues/animals to high fat/high sugar diet. We will then test the induction of conditions by analyzing the cell survival; cell morphology; RT-PCR and Western blots and then treat with various formulations of aforementioned drugs. We will evaluate the results and select specific formulations for animal studies.,IgorKovalchuk,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-20,The student should have completed at least 2; preferably 3 years of studies in molecular biology; biochemistry or pharmacology. It is preferred that the student has worked in the lab before and has general lab skills; but this is not an absolute requirement.,None
31855,Investigating the structure and function of regulators of the human autophagy degradation pathway,Autophagy is a multi-step degradation process that involves sequestration of cytoplasmic material into a transport vesicle called the autophagosome and the subsequent fusion of this autophagosome to the lysosome where the contents would be degraded by digestive enzymes inside this cellular "incinerator". The different steps of autophagy are mediated by a specialized suite of autophagy regulatory proteins and protein complexes. The proposed research project focuses on a human autophagy factor known as EPG5. EPG5 has been proposed to mediate the specific fusion between the autophagosome and the lysosome but the mechanism of action of EPG5 is not fully understood. Clinical genetics studies revealed that mutations to the gene encoding EPG5 causes a severe multi system disorder known as Vici syndrome. Although many of these mutations have now been mapped; how these genetic alterations affect the function of EPG5 is not known. The Yip laboratory recently developed a high-yield method to isolate pure EPG5 and this has enabled more comprehensive biochemical and molecular characterization of this very large-sized (~290kDa) protein. The proposed project will harness this powerful experimental platform and will specifically focus on examining the effects of various Vici syndrome disease mutations on the biochemical property and function of EPG5 using protein biochemistry; biophysical; and cell biology approaches.,CalvinYip,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The candidate must be enrolled in a Bachelor’s of Science program in biochemistry; and other related life sciences or biological sciences disciplines with solid academic standings.

31857,Improving Quantum Efficiencies in Plasmonic Photocatalysts,Surface plasmons are quantum quasiparticles describing the coherent and collective oscillations of conduction band electrons at a metal-dielectric interface. Surface plasmons can be stimulated by light to either form propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) or localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) depending on the material geometry employed. The coherent oscillations constituting plasmons are "damped" in femtoseconds by various processes to generate electron hole pairs with a non-equilibrium distribution of kinetic energies (i.e. hot carriers). The hot carriers relax to equilibrium in picoseconds through a variety of scattering and collision processes. The goal of this project is to get the plasmonic hot carriers to perform useful work with their excess energy before they relax to equilibrium. One form of useful work involves the plasmons driving a chemical reaction; which is more formally known as plasmonic catalysis. Another form of useful work involves applying plasmons to perform ultrafast photodetection in specific spectral range. The following published articles provide a flavor of the type of work this project involves: (i) https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ab814c (ii) https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/ab4554 (iii) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118644 (iv) https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c21067 The project is highly interdisciplinary and involves application of concepts from electromagnetics; semiconductor physics; laser physics; catalysis; chemical reaction engineering; heat transfer; materials science; mechanical design and spectroscopy. The best plasmonic catalysts are nanostructured heterojunctions consisting of semiconductors in contact with plasmonic materials. The typical plasmonic materials used in this project are gold; silver and transition metal nitrides such as TiN; HfN; ZrN; etc. The semiconductors used by the Shankar Lab are chalcogenides (CdS; CdSe; Cu2S; etc); 2D materials (nitrogen-doped graphene; carbon nitrides) and wide bandgap metal oxides (TiO2; ZnO; Nb2O5; Ta2O5; etc).,KarthikShankar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-06,The ideal student has a strong background in solid-state physics; electromagnetics and materials science.

The student needs to be able to communicate in English and needs to be comfortable with the idea of handling rats. Some background with coding and/or handling large data sets would be an asset. A strong interest in performing research is essential.,None
31859,Bioconversion of crude glycerol into valuable biohydrogen _Clone,In February 2011; the federal government announced that all diesel sold in Canada must be made up of two per cent biodiesel. With the new standards in place; 600 million liters of biodiesel per year would be needed in Canada. Taking into account the stoichiometric amounts of glycerol generated (about 10% by weight) during transesterification; about 60 million liters of glycerol would be produced. Despite innumerable pharmaceutical; food and other uses known for glycerol; a large (and increasing) fraction is incinerated or stored as excess in an already saturated market. A typical glycerol stream contains a mixture of glycerol with methanol; water; inorganic salts (catalyst residues); free fatty acids; unreacted mono-; di-; and triglycerides; methyl esters; and a variety of other “matter organic nonglycerol” (MONG) in varying amounts (Behr et al.; 2008). In the coming years; there will be a net increase in the biodiesel production contributing to large volumes of glycerol being produced. High volumes of glycerol-byproduct present a challenge and urgent need to develop new methods for sustainable glycerol management. Developing new industrial uses for glycerol in its turn will greatly increase the net energy and sustainability of biodiesel. In fact; glycerol is moving from the position of “additive” to that of starting material (platform). Possibilities such as combustion; co-burning; composting; animal feeding; thermochemical conversions and biological conversion have been applied for crude glycerol processing (Feng et al; 2010; Valliyappan et al; 2008; Freitas et al; 2010; Yoon et al; 2010; Hájek and Skopal; 2010; Zamzow et al; 2007; Bodík et al; 2009). Another interesting application is utilization of glycerol as substrate for microbial growth resulting in new bio-products.Value addition of biodiesel industry derived crude glycerol is the primary objective of the proposed study. The specific objectives comprise:1) Bioconversion of crude glycerol to biohydrogen; 2) bioconversion of crude,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have a general chemical/biochemical engineering/biotechnology background as the research project involves bioproduction of biohydrogen using glycerol. In addition; the student must be good in statistical analysis to verify the reproducibility of concentrations of biohydrogen. Basics in process control will be an asset. The project requires basic microbiology understanding for inoculation; petri plating etc.,None
31860,Oleaginous Yeast-Based Advanced Platform for Drop-in Fuel Feedstock Production from Forest Residues,Canada has the third richest forest resource in the world; which contributes to its major gross domestic product (GDP). This also opens an opportunity to strengthen Canada's bio-based economy; as there are still unexploited routes for forest residue utilization in the bioenergy sector. In the past decade; Canada has witnessed prominent growth in the renewable fuel sector. In addition; there is also a growing interest in the production of advanced biofuels; such as drop-in fuel; which can act as an alternative to petroleum based fuel without having a blending barrier as needed for bioethanol and biodiesel. The present project aims to develop a metabolically engineered oleaginous yeast based platform through a multidisciplinary approach for efficient production of advanced biofuel; alkane (called drop-in biofuel) from wood based lignocellulosic feedstock. The project will address several bottlenecks in the use of wood based feedstock for biofuel production; such as efficient utilization of lignocellulosic sugars; inhibitor management; and optimized process development; for efficient production of drop-in fuels. In 10 years; the technology developed in the project will serve as model for the production of various other biofuels through oleaginous yeast based platform. Through innovative research methodology and close collaboration with the industry; the project will develop a robust technology and train HQP in the field of biochemistry; molecular biology; biotechnology; biochemical engineering; for the benefit of the Canadian bioenergy and renewable forest biomass sector. From a socio-environmental perspective; the work will also contribute to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting biofuel usage in Canada and worldwide.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-06,,None
31861,Fate and removal of emerging contaminants from wastewaters and sludges in wastewater treatment plants,The wastewater treatment plants have undergone a sea change in the last three decades in terms of new add-ons for further removal of toxic pollutants to ensure a clean effluent. Despite the advanced modifications and improved appurtenances; there have been reports of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-furans (PCDFs); endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs) pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) residuals in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Meanwhile; the existing wastewater treatment processes are not designed to handle these toxic compounds especially at the levels (µg/l; ng/l or pg/l) in which they reach the WWTPs. Thus; even after treatment; the trace levels of the precursor compound remain or may get transformed into other innocuous metabolites; especially in wastewater sludge where they can get accumulated due to adsorption or locking in the sludge flocs and end up in landfills and incinerators. The specific objectives of the research proposal are as follows: (1) occurrence; transformation; and distribution of selected toxic organic compounds; namely; PPCPs (ibuprofen; sulfamethoxazole; carbamazepine; diclofenac; naproxen; ketoprofen; gemfibrozil; benzafibrate; fluoxetine; trimethoprim) and metabolites in different WWTPs of Quebec will be carried out ; (2) if the selected compounds are not present in significant concentration; other potential EDCs and PPCPs will also be screened. Subsequently; samples with higher potential will be subjected to rigorous analysis for individual target compounds; (3) In parallel to the objective 1 and 2; a comprehensive method for analytical analysis especially; pre-concentration and sample clean-up will be developed on the extraction of different toxic organic compounds from a complex matrix such as; wastewater sludge.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-06,The student will be required to have a general chemistry background as the research project involves environmental samples analysis and sampling.

31862,Novel enzyme based biosystems for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated sites,Given the recent accidents in Canada; it is clear that developing new tools for treatment of oil spills becomes necessary to develop new treatment tools that provide fast results preventing further economical consequences and destruction of soil and water. One promising approach to overcome this challenge is the use of enzymatic systems able to react with these molecules. Among the possible enzymes; oxidative enzymes are attractive and receiving increasing attention because of their versatility; the possibility to produce them on large scale; and to modify their properties. In the last decades; many efforts were focused on developing different microbial cultures that could be used to mitigate or remediate the effects of such accidents. The present project proposes to deal with this environmental issue by using enzymes optimizedunder conditions of solid state fermentation. Recovery of the desired enzymes; study their efficiency under different environmental conditions; such as soil pH and temperature will be important. Later; a chitosan nano-coating will be developed to enhance enzymes efficiency under unfavorable conditions. This research project will provide a new technology with a broad spectrum of action based on eco-friendly molecules which will produce less toxic secondary compounds than the existing treatments helping to improve the environmental quality for Canadians at a lower cost. As an estimation; the treatment of the 11 km2 of Lac Megantic accident with 200ml per m2 and $157 /L would have a final cost of around $345M with a final cost; which is much lower than the actual price estimated running in several billion dollars. Likewise; the development of advanced environmental technologies for the treatment of oil spills will offer potential growth opportunities to the existing nanotechnology based industries placing Canada as an avant-garde nation for protection of environment.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have a general chemistry background as the research project involves environmental samples analysis and sampling and designing enzymatic methods.

31863,An integrated solid state fermentation approach for production of enzymes from agro-wastes,One third of the total apple production in Canada (447;035 ton/year) is processed to produce juices; flavours and concentrates and Quebec has 32 % share (2007 statistics) in it. The end result is a solid residue containing high moisture content (70%–75%) and biodegradable organic load (high BOD and COD values). These wastes have low nutritional value and their high biodegradability causes environmental problems. A typical apple processing industry generates 25%–30% apple pomace and 5%–11% sludge (liquid waste obtained after clarification). Apple pomace consists mainly of apple skin/flesh (95%); seeds (2%–4%) and stems (1%). Apple pomace; including seeds; contains polyphenolics. These natural anti-oxidants are high in demand owing to their role as a free radical scavenger; in a number of degenerative diseases; such as cancer and atherosclerosis. The recovered antioxidants from apple pomace could be used as a nutraceutical and a food supplement. In this context; the proposed project investigates the use of apple pomace as a raw material for production of high value added products such as; polyphenols along with other products; namely lignolytic enzymes (principally laccases) and left over fermented residue as animal feed in aquaculture farms. Phanerochaete chrysosporium; a white rot fungus; will be utilized for the solid state fermentation of apple pomace. The principal objective is as follows: * Solid state fermentation of apple pomace to produce lignolytic enzymes; namely laccases: this will involve optimization of moisture content; fermentation time; pH and temperature for the growth of lignolytic enzymes using statistical techniques. The produced enzymes will be extracted by using buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration and later transformed into liquid or solid formulations for use in pulp and paper industry and also for degradation of toxic organic compounds; so finding use in seafood processing wastewater treatment; municipal wastewater treatment and bioremediation of soils.,Satinder KaurBrar,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have a general chemical/biochemical engineering/biotechnology background as the research project involves bioproduction of enzymes using agro-wastes by solid state and liquid fermentation.

31864,Learning in virtual reality: humans vs artificial neural networks,The aim of this project is to create a Virtual Reality (VR) environment for comparing learning dynamics in humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can create a naturalistic three-dimensional experience for humans; while allowing researchers to control every aspect of the visual and motor experience. This makes it an ideal platform for examining learning capabilities and dynamics in humans; as well as comparing them with learning algorithms used in today's AI models. The project will involve developing a VR experimental platform and implementing a visuomotor task; such as visually guided self-movement control; for human participants. Participants will be trained and tested on the task over multiple days; and their performance and improvement will be monitored and recorded. The same environment will be used for training and testing deep ANNs; and their performance metrics will be measured and compared with those of the human participants. The project will investigate whether humans and ANNs go through the same learning dynamics by observing and comparing their behavioral metrics and movement trajectories through the environment. The effect of unexpected events on the learning dynamics of humans and ANNs will also be measured.

31866,Excitonic processes in organic and hybrid solar cells,Organic solar cells remain an intriguing technology for flexible photovoltaic panels on curved surfaces such as vehicle roofs and building facades. This project aims to advance the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE of organic photovoltaics by better understanding excitonic processes in organic and hybrid solar cells. Due to the low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors; the Coulombic interaction between electrons and holes is poorly screened resulting in a bound quasiparticle called an exciton (specifically a Frenkel exciton). At a donor-acceptor heterojunction with the right energetics; the Frenkel exciton typically transforms to a less tightly bound charge transfer exciton (also known as an exciplex). The exciplex is still different from the Mott-Wannier excitons encountered in inorganic semiconductors. This project seeks to use clever device design; creative optoelectronic characterization and advanced spectroscopy to better understand excitonic quasiparticles and their dynamics in new semiconductor heterojunctions involving 2D semiconductors; plasmons; quantum dots; carbon nitrides; etc. The following published journal articles will provide a flavor of the type of research pursued: (i) https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b18197 (ii) https://doi.org/10.3390/polym9020035 (iii) https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b00144 (iv) https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TC05054F,KarthikShankar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-06,This project requires a strong foundation in BASIC SEMICONDUCTOR PHYSICS; and some knowledge of microfabrication processes such as vacuum deposition; photolithography; physical and chemical etching; etc. The single most important attribute is the ability to "Figure Things Out For Oneself" - including a practical bent of mind; critical thinking and a curiosity toward advanced optical & electronic toys.Prior experience in materials characterization and/or solar cell fabrication & testing is highly desirable but not essential.

31867,Supportive Neighbourhoods for People with Dementia,Persons living with dementia (PLWD) often report that they experience a shrinking world; both physically and socially; with the onset of their disease. Providing a supportive neighbourhood environment for those living with dementia in a community context is often recognised as a cost-efficient strategy to support independence; as well as the preferred choice for older adults living with dementia. There is a growing interest in examining the neighbourhood environment for its role in influencing levels of social participation (i.e.; involvement in a life situation (World Health Organization; 2001; p. 127)) and activities in later life (Chaudhury et al.; 2016; Richard et al.; 2009; Rosso et al.; 2011; World Health Organization; 2015). The neighbourhood also acts as a source of emotional and practical support for persons living with dementia with opportunities for building social networks; maintaining independence; and fostering a sense of attachment (Keady et al.; 2012; Odzakovic et al.; 2018). Availability of destinations and amenities in the community can facilitate healthy aging by supporting older adults’ functional abilities and enabling their participation in society; especially for those experiencing declining cognitive; mental; social and physical capacities (World Health Organization; 2015). However; there is scarce empirical evidence on the built environmental features that constitute supportive neighbourhood environments for persons with dementia. The Project Objectives are: 1) identify neighbourhood destinations that PLWD visit and changes in the patterns of visits over time; 2) identify neighbourhood built environmental features that affect mobility; engagement and social participation among PLWD; 3) develop an easy-to-use environmental audit and advocacy tool to conduct descriptive and evaluative assessment of the neighbourhood environment supportive of PLWD; 4) develop planning and design guidelines to inform decision-makers; such as municipal policymakers; city planners; urban designers and engineers in the creation of a dementia-inclusive neighbourhood environment;,HabibChaudhury,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,Excellent written and verbal skills Experience in writing academic papers Skills in qualitative research methods Background in social sciences/health sciences/planning and design Ability to work effectively with team,None
31868,Physical Environmental Assessment in Long-Term Care Facilities,The physical environment is a critical component of a supportive long-term care facility for people with dementia. There is substantial evidence that has identified the effect of unsupportive physical environments that contribute to common challenging behaviours in people with dementia; e.g.; spatial disorientation; anxiety; agitation; social withdrawal; etc. Unsupportive environmental features in residential care settings contribute to spatial disorientation; anxiety and agitation among residents with dementia (Chaudhury et al.; 2018; Chaudhury & Cooke; 2014; Chaudhury et al.; 2016; Chaudhury et al.; 2013). These environments include features such as long hallways; large dining rooms; shared bedrooms; high noise levels; institutional lighting; etc. Conversely; a well-designed supportive physical environment has been shown to foster positive behaviours; such as reduced agitation; increase in social contact; less dependence in conducting activities of daily living; etc. (Chaudhury et al.; 2018; Chaudhury & Cooke; 2014; Chaudhury et al.; 2016; Chaudhury et al.; 2013). Supportive environmental features include small household; homelike kitchen; cluster design with no hallways; positively designed outdoor spaces; etc. There is a need for developing assessment tools to systematically measure the physical environmental features supporting the quality of life for people with dementia in long-term care facilities.The goal of this project is to pilot test a physical environmental assessment instrument; named Person Oriented Environment Tool (POET) in dementia care units of 8-10 residential care facilities within Metro Vancouver. The research instrument assesses the quality of physical environmental features in the care setting that are supportive/unsupportive of residents’ behaviours and social interactions.,HabibChaudhury,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,,None

31870,Model Predictive Control of Batch Processes,Batch processes constitute a class of processes that play an important role in the production and processing of a wide range of value-added products (i.e.; chemical; pharmaceuticals; bio-chemicals; etc.). They are finite duration processes with unique characteristics; such as the absence of equilibrium points and nonlinear and time-varying dynamics over a wide range of operating conditions; that preclude the direct application of control strategies designed for continuous systems. Unlike continuous systems; which are characterized by control at an equilibrium point; the primary control objective in batch processes is to reach a specified product quality by batch termination. The economic benefits from batch processing are realized from the consistent production of on-spec product. Direct control to the specified quality; however; is impractical in most cases because quality measurements are unavailable online and only made offline after batch completion. Motivated by the above considerations; in this thesis we will develop a within-batch quality control strategy for batch processes. The method will be tested on several processes.

31880,Environmental impacts of dam breaks,The main risk commonly associated with a dam is its failure and rapid flooding of the downstream land; with the associated risk of life and property loss; including damage to infrastructure and environmental aspects; as debris; mud; and other substances contained in the reservoir; such as in the case of mining tailings; are released downstream and may cause severe environmental impacts. The research program aims to develop a comprehensive analysis framework for the environmental impacts of dam breaks; creating a comprehensive indicator set that will greatly enhance the reliability of the assessment results. Special attention will be given to mining tailings; given the large number of mining operations in Canada; and the usually hazardous nature of the wastes stored within tailings. Environmental impact indicators associated with the spill of wastes from tailings will be included in the analysis framework. Environmental impacts will be quantified by considering the economic value associated with the damages; such as loss of ecosystem services. Hydraulic analysis software will be combined with Geographical Information Systems to create a tool that will synthesize the analysis framework developed. First Nations communities have suffered extensive impacts associated with the construction of dams; usually due to the communities being relocated from their original lands. When their relocation sites are in the valleys potentially affected by a dam break; they are likely to suffer yet more impacts. Therefore; special attention will be given to the effects of dam breaks on these communities; which usually rely on the environment to survive. A Virtual Reality environment for dam breaks will be developed.

31887,Understanding Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,Concussions are a form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); often called the “unseen injury”; because of the lack of obvious damage. As a result; many individuals suffer repeated concussions; often in short time spans. In some sports; like hockey and football; awareness is growing that repeated sub-concussive blows to the head are routinely incurred in practices and games. Although many of these impacts do not result in a diagnosis of concussion; there is a growing appreciation that both concussions and sub-concussive impacts can negatively impact cognitive function in the developing brain; and that repeated concussions (r-mTBI) can have long-term detrimental effects for cognition in elderly populations. Despite these concerns; few laboratories have systematically studied r-mTBI in a preclinical model that properly mimics the human condition. We have recently developed a model that enables us to accurately examine r-mTBI and understand how the brain responds to repeated mTBI. Because significant structural damage does not occur in mTBI; our focus is on whether there is damage to small blood vessels in the brain. These vessels are below the threshold of resolution for magnetic resonance imaging; but can be resolved using high resolution microscopy. When damaged; these vessels can release a compound in the blood called fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is normally important for clotting; but can also initiate an inflammatory process involving brain microglia that negatively impacts neurons; and impairs learning and memory processes. The results of the proposed work will help us to better understand the mechanisms involved in mTBI; how they directly impact brain function; and increase our understanding of how r-mTBI early in life could negatively impact individuals as they age. More importantly; this work will enable us to determine the therapeutic value of modulating fibrinogen’s effects in the brain to help reduce the negative impact of r-mTBI on cognition.,BrianChristie,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,Basic biochemistry/biology/histology skills are preferred.

31888,Control of American foulbrood and spread of antimicrobial resistance in beekeeping industry,American foulbrood (AFB) caused by Paenibacillus larvae is a devastating brood disease of honey bees. In addition to various integrated pest management practices; antibiotics are often used to control this diseases in North American commercial beekeeping operations. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of P. larvae has been documented in honey bee colonies in Saskatchewan; however; little is known about the prevalence; distribution and potential spread of AMR P. larvae strains in Saskatchewan. This multifaceted research program employs a combination of investigation of clinical outbreaks; surveillance and molecular epidemiology of AFB as well as various bacteriology and molecular biology approaches to enhance antimicrobial stewardship in the Canadian beekeeping industry by judicious and evidence-based antibiotic therapy applied in apiculture based on scientific risk assessment.,ElemirSimko,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-20,Student must not be allergic to bee stings.

31889,Identification of novel ectonucleotidase inhibitors,Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) and other ectonucleotidases are enzymes that hydrolyze nucleotides at the cell surface. These nucleotides affect various biological functions via the activation of nucleotide (P2) receptors. To state a few examples; we observed that inflammatory processes; cancer; thrombosis and bone formation (in bone diseases) are all affected by the activity of these enzymes. In collaboration with chemists specialized in nucleotide research from Israel; Pakistan; USA and Germany we have developed several inhibitors of these enzymes. These inhibitors are synthetized with the medium term goal to regulate the above biological functions (each being specific for a single ectonucleotidase). Before testing these novel molecules on ectonucleotidase activity we will express the recombinant form of each of these enzymes in a mammalian expression system (such as COS-7) and partially purify these enzymes. The expression level and activity of these prepared proteins will be confirmed and evaluated by Western blot and activity assays. The novel potential inhibitors will be tested for potency and specificity on each of these ectonucleotidases for the identification of both general inhibitors and specific inhibitors. It is also possible that some of the best inhibitors will be tested in the relevant biological assays with mice; and/or human or mice primary cells. This project is designed for both: develop tools for basic research and develop/test molecules for a potential clinical application.,JeanSévigny,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,Background in biochemistry; cell culture and enzymology in both theory and practice would help.,None
31890,Development of a new treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, Colitis),According to the trainee's interest; up to 3 trainees can work on some of the 4 aspects below. 1) Determine if and how the blockade of the P2Y receptors in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) prevents inflammation in 2 mouse models of mucosal inflammation that most resemble human IBD; i.e.; the adoptive T cell transfer model of colitis and the Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) models. We will intra-rectally administer different types of blockers of the P2 receptors expressed at the surface of IECs; such as a scavenger of general P2 receptor ligands (apyrase) or specific antagonists of P2Y1; P2Y2 and P2Y6; and determine their impact on the inflammatory responses in these 2 IBD models. In the DSS model we will also use deficient mice for these receptors and use bone marrow transplantation experiments to discriminate a role of the receptors expressed on both leukocytes and IECs. Preliminary results with the DSS model show that engagement of both P2Y2 and P2Y6 receptors in IECs lead to the inflammation. 2) Define molecular mechanisms by which P2Y receptors control intestinal inflammation using primary IECs from WT mice as well as from P2Y2 and P2Y6 KO mice. We will focus on examining the synthesis and release of cytokines as well as cell permeability. These experiments will also be performed with IECs purified from healthy sections of the colon from human patients. 3) Engineer a soluble form of NTPDase8 as a potential treatment for IBD; and test it in the IBD mouse models detailed above. 4) Test new P2Y receptor antagonists developed for application in humans; as a potential treatment for IBD; using the IBD mouse models detailed above.,JeanSévigny,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,Background in pharmacology; biochemistry; cell culture; mouse models; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); in both theory and practice would help but are not mandatory.,None

31894,Mobile Application Analysis,This project focuses on developing better defense mechanisms for identifying such malware using application analysis and ML-based techniques. The student working on this project will join the team of graduate and undergraduate students working on malware testing and analysis; and ML reliability approaches. One current direction of this work is identifying applications that exhibit malicious behavior only under a set of complicated and specific conditions; e.g.; at a certain time or at a certain location. Such malicious behaviors; typically referred to as logic and time bombs; are difficult to detect in practice: testing-based approaches often fail to efficiently identify inputs that trigger these behaviors. To continue our existing work; we focus on developing a novel application analysis framework for identifying logic and time bombs in an efficient manner. We are also exploring approaches for identifying malware that downloads and executes it malicious content on a command obtained from a third-party command-and-control server. Finally; this project focuses on efficient mobile application testing techniques that enable dynamic-analysis-based approaches.,JuliaRubin,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,,None

31896,Software Fault Detection,Trace-based program analysis techniques; such as dynamic slicing and trace differencing; can ease debugging by computing an accurate subset of program statements that are relevant to a particular faulty behaviour. In our prior work; we developed automated dynamic slicing tools and trace differencing tools. While these tools are efficient and effective; they are not integrated into modern development environments (IDE); such as IntelliJ and are rather launched from the command line. This hinders their adoption in practice as developers rather need the support to be integrated into their workflow effectively; to help them debug their code “natively” and consistently with their existing working practices. The goal of this project is thus to integrate the program analysis tools developed in our prior work into the IntelliJ debugger and evaluate the effectiveness of the produced solution.,JuliaRubin,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,,None
31897,Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy of Biomaterials,Apatite; A5(XO4)3Z; is an important class of phosphate minerals due to its unique ability to accept varied ion substitutions at the A; X and Z positions. Materials researchers have used the A and X positions to produce apatite with applications that include ionic conduction and long-term nuclear waste storage. Earth scientists have utilized Z substitutions for petrology indicators within igneous and metamorphic rocks; including lunar research.1 Z-site substitutions (Z = OH; F or Cl) of hydroxyapatite (HA; Ca5(PO4)3OHX) is essential for calcification within living hard tissues including human dentin and bone; and hypermineralization within crustaceans.2 While OH- to F- substitution (Z-site) along the C-column of the crystal is known to increase strength and acid erosion resistance within apatite materials; the exact location(s); phases (e.g.; CaF2) and medium-range environment (e.g.; CO3-F vs PO4-F) has remained elusive. Diffraction techniques have been unsuccessful due to the lack of long-range periodicity and similar electron density of the F and OH anions. However; solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can probe locally at the F and OH sites; extracting and characterizing the short- and medium-range order caused by Z-site substitutions. 19F and 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy will be essential to study F/OH positions within synthetic and natural apatite. Careful selection will allow us to develop a chemical shift fingerprint tools that can impact and assist researchers in these fields. Multi-resonance techniques will address medium-range structure including X site defects (e.g.; CO3).,VladimirMichaelis,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,,None
31898,Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy Investigation of Energy Materials,The unprecedented rise in the efficiency of organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells has captured the attention of the scientific community; with rapid advancement in efficiency over the past five years. The ease in which perovskite based solar cells can be manufactured at low temperatures and using a solution-based approach makes them extremely attractive when compared to convention solar cells. The most effective perovskite is the methyl ammonium (MA) lead iodide (MAPbI3) which has been shown to deliver an efficient ~20% conversion; unfortunately the stability of such a species in the natural environment is of concern for the conventional lifetime solar cells are in use (i.e.; 20 to 30 Years). This is due to its propensity to breakdown under routine conditions including the high temperature phase change which occurs at (>60 oC;) and its hydroscopic nature; namely absorbing water eventually forming PbI2; a highly water solution lead salt. This has lead to great concerns regarding the leaching of Pb based salts into the environment; leading to severe socioeconomic issues if not contained. MASnI3 is far less toxic; although more reactive and less efficient at transfer. Efficiency should be tunable over time to improve this aspect; although the reactivity remains to be tackled.,VladimirMichaelis,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Students should have some type of physical science or engineering background.

31900,Blockchains for Data Storage and Mining in Learning Analytics,The central technology being explored as a platform for this learning trace process is the blockchain algorithm; popularized in cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain algorithms use a hash algorithm; nonce and block code; along with the message packet; to generate a hash code. These can be arranged into a chain by embedding the hash of a previous block into the packet of the next. The nonce key is chosen such that the generated hash is signed; with a static header. Cryptocurrency blockchains use the hash header “0000” as its signature. Unsigned hashes can be fixed by changing all following messages in the chain. Therefore; to ensure tampering security; multiple trace stores will have to be installed for error detection and correction. By following this procedure; tampering in the chain can be detected by the fact that any tampered block in the chain will have an unsigned hash; or by the fact that a particular blockchain does not agree with its comparable chains stored in other servers. This will make the learning trace immutable. In addition to this feature; this project will explore the ability for a student to extend and retract read permissions to this blockchain; or segments thereof; through the use of RSA encryption algorithms. This will make the learning trace under the control of the owner. Additional features of this format to be explored include the ability of evaluating institutions to independently and verifiably add assessments to a learning trace chain; the use of chain attributes as indicators for learning performance; and the use of learning trace chains as a resource for employers evaluating potential and current employees. Architectural features of this project will involve a learning event chain server and data store; a learning event ingestion system; a learning event inferencing system; and a learning event chain browser.,VivekanandanKumar,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,The candidates should have strong coding skills; preferably in Java or Python.,None

31902,Higher Education and the Fourth Industrial Revolution,With the ability of AI algorithms to learn information; knowledge and insights exclusively from raw data without specific instructions about information; knowledge and insights is evidence that the inflection point has been reached as cognification evolves. The ability to mimic human intelligence; vision; hearing; physical movements; managing resources; diagnosis; nursing; emotion and social interactions impacts every possible domain; except for domains where data does not matter. Students; across these domains; will learn and use such AI algorithms as core skills. As computers mimic and; when needed; exceed human capabilities; jobs traditionally held by humans will be lost; from programmer to truck driver to lawyer to financial analyst to non-specialist physicians to soldiers to factory workers to non-specialist teachers. During these near-inflection years; students will be forced to learn new cognification skills that supplement traditional domain-specific job skills. Near-inflection will also bring in ‘gig jobs’ that are transient in nature and can only be stop-gap. During the later post-inflection years; students will exclusively study cognification skills. Post-inflection years will see massive retraining to help students attain systems thinking; entrepreneurship; cultural agility and critical thinking. AI algorithms and associated technologies will force students to addressing global issues such as poverty; human existence; environmental engineering; genetic editing; hunger; disease; compassion; resource sharing; weather engineer and global planning. Topics such as computing; physics; mathematics will mesh into courses that target global issues because of the changes in career models necessitated by the disappearance of traditional jobs associated with traditional career models. students will no longer code for a computer application; they simply design solutions for the problem; select appropriate pieces of preexisting code; mash them together; inject cognification algorithms; point to the variety of data that already exist and data that can be supplied in the future; and move on to the next application.,VivekanandanKumar,Alberta,Athabasca University,English,2024-05-01,Students will be asked to explore a range of contemporary skills that higher education students graduate with; across multiple domains; and analyse whether a) these skills will be impacted by cognification; and b) if so; how to up-skill students to complement their skills to aling with cognification.

31904,Biochar and Bees,The berry industry is critically important to Atlantic Canada; producing 28% of Canada's Fruit and Berry production; well above Ontario's 15%. However; the region's berry growers face significant challenges due to climate change. Wild pollinators; which are essential for crop production; are moving away from crops to seek refuge from climate extremes; and poor growing conditions in many areas exacerbate the situation. To address these challenges; we propose utilizing crab biochar; a carbon zero product made from the waste of the crab industry; to enhance the cropping conditions of berry crops; promote nesting of wild pollinators; and initiate natural pollination. The Provincial government has mandated that waste from the crab industry no longer be discarded in compost or landfill; requiring this industry to come up with solutions for utilizing this important waste stream. Louisbourg Seafoods Inc. catches nearly 125;000 pounds of snow crab yearly; with approximately 70% of each crab harvested being disposed of in landfills. This waste represents a significant loss of a natural calcium source that can be charred and used for fruit production. MacQuarrie's group has demonstrated that converting this waste into crab biochar generates a material with the properties of biochar and contains natural lime (CaCO3); which is important not only for plant growth but also for ground-nesting wild bees' preferred nesting conditions. Pindar's group has shown that over half of wild bee species that pollinate berry crops are nesting in the ground. By providing pollinators with a soil amendment that increases their nesting sites within the crop; we can directly increase pollination of the crop. Our proposal aims to leverage the benefits of crab biochar to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly berry production in Atlantic Canada.,StephanieMacquarrie,Nova Scotia,Cape Breton University,English,2024-06-03,The students should have an aptitude for safe work practices and the ability to multi-task in a busy work environment; and be able to work productively as part of a team while responding to feedback.

31905,Mental illness in the workplace: A meta-analysis,The world is experiencing a mental health crisis. Mental health problems include a general decline in psychological well-being and an increase in mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Mental illnesses are a particular concern in the workplace because they are highly common (i.e.; one in every four employees report experiencing mental health issues); burdensome (i.e.; mental health-related disability claims make up most of the workers' compensation claims); and lengthy (i.e.; 100 days of disability leave in general). Among different types of mental illnesses; depression; anxiety disorders; and substance abuse constitute the most significant portion of mental disorders in the workforce. In this study; we will conduct a meta-analytical investigation (i.e.; analyze and synthesize published and non-published studies) on mental illness in the workplace. We will identify the work-related causes of these three types of mental illnesses as well as their work-related outcomes. Although there is great interest among researchers as well as practitioners on the topic of mental health in the workplace; so far; no systematic efforts have been made to combine the findings of past research to develop a unified model on the topic.

31908,Hyper-operations,Hyperoperators are an infinite sequence of recursively defined operations that logically extend the following sequence of elementary arithmetic operations: addition; multiplication (an iterated addition); exponentiation (an iterated multiplication). Historically; one of the first discussions about hyperoperators was the work of Albert Bennet in 1914. But it was not until 1947 and the detailed work of Reuben Goodstein that the modern terminology and notation was established.

31910,Gas flow through porous media: landfill, natural gas and sparging wells,The students will review existing analytical; semi-analytical and/or full numerical solutions to gas flow through porous media. There has been recent progress in two directions: flow subject to azimuthally varying permeability in the porous matrix; and turbulence in the vicinity of the ingress into the well. Both were shown to explain some of the control issues experienced in the field. The region close to the well was identified as almost a separate flow field with abrupt changes in pressure and velocity of the gas.

31912,Decoupling motion and deformation in ultasound measurements in carotid artery,This project is in collaboration with Prof. Mark Rakobowchuk from the Department of Biological Sciences at Thompson Rivers University. Prof. Rakobowchuk's lab collects ultrasound recordings of the motion of the carotid artery during regular breathing. The tissue of the artery wall is elastic and undergoes stresses that; on one hand; are synchorinised with the heart cycle; and on the other; are coordinated with the pulsatile blood flow and pressure change in the vessel. The contraction force of the heart and the pulsatility of the arterial flow induces longitudinal motion as well as deformation; whilst the periodicity of the blood pressure change causes radial distention and contraction; perforce coupled to the longitudinal deformation. The CAROLAB software processes the ultrasound imagery and is capable of tracking a predefined region of the artery wall. The challenge of this project is to decompose the tracking data into correct components of the stress tensor and velocity vector. This is a good training opportunity for students; who envision their ultimate position in inter-disciplinary scientific research. The intern will gain valuable skills in working with biological signals; image processing; visco-elastic theory; reconstruction of conservation laws in continuum mechanics based on real measurements and uncertainty analysis.

31915,Using AI to Improve Chatbots,Software systems play an important role in our daily lives; making the quality of software systems of paramount importance. To ensure the quality of software systems; my research aims to develop analytics and tools that can be used to identify potentially defective code and improve the maintenance and evolution of the software. One such tool is askgit.io; a virtual assistant (chatbot) that helps developers navigate and understand their project repository’s data. The project involves the proposal of a virtual assistant (aka chatbot) to help practitioners in various software development tasks. In particular; we plan to use cutting-edge AI and NLP techniques to answer questions related to the software projects. Moreover; the assistant will analyze different software artifacts and activities to highlight possible issues that might occur and suggest solutions to overcome those issues. The assistant should be able to reason the proposed solutions in natural language. To evaluate the assistant; we will employ a number of quantitative (e.g.; precision and recall) and qualitative (e.g.; grounded theory) methods. The project will be performed on a number of large and recent open-source software systems such as Google Chrome and Android. The project will play an important role and contribute to our chatbot project: askgit.io. The successful completion of this project will enable software researchers and practitioners to better understand the key development activities that impact software quality. Moreover; the project will contribute to a virtual assistant that is integrated into the development environment and can be used to help in software project development and successfully manage the development team. Moreover; the assistant helps to decrease the time-to-market by increasing the development velocity and highlighting critical issues ahead of time so their risk can be mitigated before the software is released.,EmadShihab,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-01,,None
31916,Analysis of Case–Control Studies Data with Errors,The epidemiological studies; diagnostic tests; and comparative therapeutic trials often results in count data presented in r × c contingency tables or cross tables. These must be interpreted relative risk; odds ratio; length of the confidence interval correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two quantities; for example; exposure expressed at three levels none; low and; high and disease expressed as yes or no. For example; the British Medical Journal published a case control study in which the association between tea consumption and esophageal carcinoma was examined. Of the 300 patients with esophageal carcinoma (“cases”); 249 reported that they never; or very rarely; drank green tea; 17 (6.4%) frequently drank green tea. Of the 571 study participants without esophageal carcinoma (“controls”); 356 reported that they rarely drank green tea; in comparison with 30 subjects with regular consumption. However; the effects of inaccurate sample size and or measuring error on the relative risk; odds ratio; length of the confidence interval and the p-value may have serious implications in making informed decisions. The main objective of the proposed project is to study the relative risk; odds ratio; confidence interval and test of hypothesis in case- control studies when data is imprecise and may have sampling or non-sampling errors. The intern will develop neutrosophic statistics methods which are suitable for ambiguous; vague; imprecise; incomplete; or even unknown data values.,PraneshKumar,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Knowledge of Basic Statistics; Calculus; and any Computer software/programming.,None
31917,Nanofiber formation by centrifugal spinning,The demand to address the world’s energy and environmental issues creates a pressing need to develop technology and devices; based on high-performance materials; for clean energy (e.g.; energy conversion; storage and conservation); and clean environment (e.g.; water and air pollution abatement). Particularly interesting and useful types of high-performance materials are advanced functional nanosized materials that can enhance charge transport; as building blocks in energy and electronic devices. In this context; nanofibers are being increasingly studied thanks to their unique characteristics such as high surface-area- to-volume ratio; improved thermal and mechanical properties; electrical properties; and confinement effects. Our research on nanofiber production by a new method called centrifugal spinning delivers the fundamental; concrete knowledge to produce nanofibers more easily and at lower cost. Nanofiber production through the Centrifugal Spinning Method (CSM); in which a nozzle or orifice rotates at high speed around its axis of symmetry; can produce high volumes of polymeric fibers with average diameters around 300 nm. To apply CSM; a polymer solution or melt is loaded into a specially designed spinneret capable of rotating the fluid. As a result of the centrifugal force applied; the fluid is forced through the orifices of the spinneret producing continuous polymer jets. The trajectory of the polymer jet is curved due to the rotational forces as they are stretched into nanofibers; which are collected as a fine web on the collectors positioned away from the center of rotation. We propose to study CSM nanofiber formation through a frame- work of integrated theoretical and experimental program; our aim is to provide understanding of the physical mechanisms of the nanofiber formation; characterize the regimes of production; and predict/model nanofiber final radius and its morphology.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,,None
31918,Fluid flows of non-Newtonian fluids in narrow channels,Viscous fingering (VF) instability occurs when a less-viscous fluid displaces a more-viscous one; and refers to the appearance of finger-like interfacial patterns. Complex densely branched and dendritic-like patterns may be eventually formed as a consequence of a repetitive finger-tip-splitting. There has been a continuing interest in studying VF as an archetype of interfacial pattern forming and front propagation systems since it appears in Enhanced Oil Recovery and Carbon Sequestration. VF may occur in various geometries; while the occurrence of this phenomenon in the Hele-Shaw cells; made of two flat plates; has received much attention as a convenient framework to analyze interfacial instabilities in narrow confined passages; e.g.; in porous media. Most of the Hele-Shaw cell displacement research has revolved around immiscible displacements; focusing on the prediction of morphological features and periodic structures; while extensions to miscible displacements have been limited even for Newtonian fluids. Knowing about this gap in the literature; our research focusing on miscible displacement of non-Newtonian fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell. Literature of the research on viscous fingering in non-Newtonian fluid is very limited. Our novel research will effectively fill this gap for miscible displacements and provide guidelines for oil and gas industry processes that deal with the fingering phenomena.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,,None
31919,Multiphase flows of complex fluids,The subject of this project is studying displacement flows of viscoplastic fluids in geometry that is in motion. Viscoplastic fluids are non-Newtonian fluids. The main feature of a viscoplastic fluid is that the fluid does not really deform until a critical shear stress is exceeded locally. Therefore; these gelled or soft-solid materials are seen to be hard-to-remove especially when they are in restricted geometry with a lot of boundaries. However; there are many industrial processes where we do need to deal with the removal of viscoplastic materials. One of the main of these applications is in the petroleum industry; e.g.; in the primary cementing process (PCP) in which viscoplastic drilling mud must be completely removed by cement to provide zonal isolation. Certain geometrical movements (e.g.; pipe reciprocation) are being used to enhance this process; without proper justification or guidance from laboratory research. The proposed research involves studying particular geometrical motions that facilitate the removal of viscoplastic fluids by another fluid; which is highly relevant to PCP; and has high impact in the field of energy and environment. The goal in this new research direction is to employ certain slow movements of flow geometry to remove a viscoplastic fluid by another fluid. The research conducted by the student will deliver how this removal may become possible. In particular; she will investigate the effects of two movements of the geometry on the fluid flow during the displacement flow process: • Slow reciprocation of a pipe geometry along the direction of the flow. • Slow oscillation of a pipe geometry around its longitudinal axis.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,None
31920,Interactions of cell signaling pathways in spinal cord patterning,Zebrafish; a small tropical fish; has emerged as a powerful experimental system to study human development and diseases. Approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. We use zebrafish as a model system; because molecular and genetic analyses can be combined with high resolution in vivo imaging and large-scale small molecule screens. The developing spinal cord is a highly structured organ that consists of different subtypes of proliferative neural progenitors and their post-mitotic progeny. Our previous work demonstrates that the Notch signaling pathway functions to control Hedgehog responsiveness of neural progenitor cells in the spinal cord. In this project; the student will test whether Notch signaling also controls the competence of neural progenitor cells to respond to other cell signaling molecules; such as BMP and Wnt. The student will utilize gain-of-function and loss-of-function tools; including small molecule inhibitors and transgenic lines; to determine if manipulation of Notch signaling affects BMP and Wnt signaling responses in the patterning of the dorsal spinal cord. Using transgenic reporters; the student will visualize the cell signaling dynamics during spinal cord patterning in live embryos. This project will provide novel insights on cell signaling cross-talk and cell fate specification; two important issues in the field of developmental biology.,PengHuang,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a strong background in molecular biology and genetics; and have a strong interest in developmental biology.

31921,Regulation of muscle regeneration in zebrafish,Zebrafish; a small tropical fish; has emerged as a powerful experimental system to study human development and diseases. Approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. We use zebrafish as a model system; because molecular and genetic analyses can be combined with high resolution in vivo imaging and large-scale small molecule screens. Using zebrafish muscle regeneration as a model; my lab studies how crosstalk between muscles and non-muscle cells maintains muscle homeostasis. Through an expression screen; we recently found that ctgfa and ctgfb (connective tissue growth factor); well-known direct target genes of the Hippo signaling pathway; are robustly induced at the site of muscle injury; suggesting that activation of Hippo signaling regulates muscle regeneration. Hippo signaling was first identified for its function in organ size control; but its role in regulating tissue regeneration is largely unclear. In this summer project; the student will determine how Hippo signaling contributes to muscle injury repair. First; using a needle injury assay; he/she will perform in situ RNA hybridization to examine the expression pattern of core effectors of the Hippo pathway; such as yap; taz; and tead; in a detailed time-course during muscle injury repair. As a complementary approach; he/she will carry out immunohistochemistry to determine the subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ as readouts for pathway activation. Next; the student will carry out double staining to determine the identity of cells that show up-regulated ctgf expression during muscle regeneration. Finally; using a transgenic line ctgf:GFP that we previously developed; he/she will perform time-lapse imaging to determine the dynamics of ctgf+ cells during the process of muscle regeneration. This project will help elucidate the role of Hippo signaling in muscle injury repair and provide the foundation for understanding complex cell-cell interactions during tissue regeneration.,PengHuang,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,No skills available,None

31925,Advanced Terahertz Spectroscopy,Terahertz (THz) radiation science is expected to have an extremely significant impact on a wide variety of disciplines that are bound to shape the lives of people in the 21st century. In particular; THz waves (or T-Rays); with frequency ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz; (i) can penetrate and image inside plastics; semiconductor wafers; fabrics; and most dielectric materials that may be opaque to visible light; (ii) have low photon energies that do not cause harmful photoionization in biological tissue; and (iii) exhibit strong dispersion as well as absorption for numerous molecules. Therefore; T-ray imaging and diagnostics have tremendous potential for applications in non-destructive testing and imaging; medical diagnosis; health monitoring; and chemical and biological identification. However; applications in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum are only now reaching maturity. The full potential of the spectral region is held back by the limited control that we have over the way this form of light interacts with materials. In this project; we will explore a new technique to use THz radiation to detect and monitor the concentration of various targets. Examples of such targets include algal toxins; which could contaminate drinking water; and viruses; such as those that cause pandemics. The viruses (bacteriophages) that we will use in this project are absolutely safe for humans.

31926,Supporting the Health of Victims of Gender-based Violence through Community Programs: Applying an Ethical Lens,Sexual violence is rampant worldwide and particularly pervasive in India; where it has reached and all time high rate during the last decade. The social construction of gender in India remains associated with sustained systematic discrimination against women. Present in spheres of everyday life; it is an issue when seeking health care and justice. One of the consequences is that victims of sexual violence are confronted to inadequate response from health care services and medico-legal systems in regards to quality of response. Quality of health care response creates a safe environment and allows gathering of medical and legal evidence needed for a valid case for medico-legal response and justice. A closer and systematic look at a series of crucial points is needed: 1. the psychosocial support provided to victims; the practices and services surrounding healthcare provision in the context of rape and sexual violence; 2. the process of collection of forensic evidence and practice associated with the clinical exam post event; the reliability of applying protocols and guidelines when and if available; 3. the sensitivity by health care providers to social determinants of health and contextual experiences affecting the ‘victims’. These factors highlight the current situation in India where forensic evidence collection is the main focus to the detriment of care and psychosocial support of victims of sexual violence. Actions are required to take into consideration the victims’ voices in the forensic evidence collection process and establish empathetic medical and legal services for better provision of care and justice. While guidelines and standard protocols for interventions post rape do exist; and standard protocols for the collection of forensic evidence are being improved; what is needed is a better understanding of the premises for an increased quality response within an integrated health system and medico-legal practices sensitive to living contexts.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

31927,The Changing Landscape of Women’s Health: Challenges and Opportunities of Global Health: At the Intersections of Gender and Migration,The first week of the 58th Commission on the Status of Women ended in March 2014. Information ranging from the most effective strategies to economically empower women to learning more about the initiative; which focuses on the voices of men by encouraging them to speak out against the discrimination and inequalities experienced by women and girls globally. Empowerment beyond numbers: this is one of the messages that we need to continue and work on as we think of the challenges that women are still facing beyond geographical frontiers. Significant work has been accomplished and provided a substantive conceptualization of female-male relations; both inside and outside of the public domain; challenging the social determinants and risks contributing to poverty; and designing routes of women’s empowerment with concrete health achievements. By applying a gender lens with sensitivity to the socio-political context of poverty alleviation strategies; research and interventions in public health increasingly provide a positive outlook characterized by an empowerment approach. Recognizing the intricate and complex nature of development processes which lead to the undeniable conclusion that women must become actively engaged as socio-political actors in the fight against poverty; one of the objectives of this internship is to contribute to discussions on the knowledge base which requires an accounting of the conditions and circumstances of women’s lives; both at home and in their communities. The activities will draw upon the fact that social determinants are central to programs and policies regarding prevention and control of diseases such as HIV/AIDS; malaria and tuberculosis. While there is ample literature demonstrating that social factors promote and/or undermine the health of women; men; families and populations; there is limited knowledge about the social processes underlying the unequal distribution of health among specific populations which in turn; is at the root of persistent social disparities.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

It focuses on improved care and prevention for migrants from female genital circumcision or mutilation (FGC/M) performing countries. Provision of optimal; equitable and gender-sensitive health care to women and girls with FGC/M; and to those who may be at risk of being exposed to this practice is challenging; as dissatisfaction and unsease experienced both by women and health care providers regarding the quality of care available has been increasingly reported. It is proposed to gather knowledge; attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals towards FGC/M; to identify the extent to wich current healthcare provider training packages incorporate the voices of women who have been subject to FGC/M; to compare and contrast predictive models of risk estimates across the partner countries; to gain better understanding of the best practices regarding policy implementations and legal frameworks with regards to the prevention of FGC/M. Quality of health care response creates a safe environment and allows gathering of medical and legal evidence needed for a valid case for medico-legal response and justice.

31929,End-of-Life and Palliative Care: Cultural and Gender Diversity as Determinants of Access and Equity,Abstract: Drawing on feminist ethics and an intersectional analysis; the objective of the project is to discuss how relational autonomy is related to equity and human rights. We argue the need to uphold ethical commitments in clinical health care encounters that are personalized; informed by human relationships; recognition of social specificities; sensitive to context and human interdependencies. Given the increasing exposure of health care professionals to moral issues related to equity and rights in the context of gender sensitivity and cultural diversity; there is a greater need to mitigate intersecting structural vulnerabilities related to both micro (individual) and macro (health policy and practice) level that shape health outcomes differentially for women; men; boys and girls. In our analysis; we intend to examine how relational autonomy and intersectionality can advance the virtues of principle of respect for autonomy by addressing intersecting vulnerabilities that can occur when language; gender; health literacy and other categories of social difference; impact informed consent in health and research contexts. Overall; the project focuses on the complexity of relational alternatives that promote equity and rights of those involved in clinical relationships.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

31931,Improving Health Equity: The Promising Role of Community Health Workers in Canada: Unravelling Gender based Challenges,While there is ample literature demonstrating that social factors promote and/or undermine the health of women; men; families and populations; there is limited knowledge about the social processes underlying the unequal distribution of health among specific populations which in turn; is at the root of persistent social disparities. Social determinants draw attention to a number of social factors such as women and men’s social and economic circumstances; which contribute directly to their health The objectives of this internship are anchored in the knowledge that one of the most powerful ways to advance development and health is to increase the most vulnerable section of the population; largely women; to adequate health care services; which in turn allows for improvement of quality of their life and that of their families. While epidemiological evidence indicates that in low or middle-income countries; selected infectious diseases such as Hepatitis A and E are more prevalent among men than women; this may be explained by gender differences in the social pattern of interactions. In addition to differences in exposure and risk of infection; there is a difference between men and women in the progression from infection to disease; in turn leading to a differential in the notification rates and treatment among women and men. Such results support the importance to derive and implement initiatives in collaboration with community members; health care providers; designers and decision-makers aimed at redressing persistent inequities. In an effort to increase our understanding of challenges and opportunities experienced by various stakeholders involved with access and use of safe water in communities; the proposed work will attempt to address both the lack of resources and barriers (basic needs approach) as well as the opportunity to attain some level of personal outcomes (including health) known as capabilities approach with a gender sensitive approach.,BilkisVissandjée,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-27,1.

31938,Intelligence-driven Cyber Attribution System,To determine the actor or actors responsible for a cyberattack; experts often conduct extensive forensic investigations; including analyzing digital forensic evidence and historical data; establishing intent or motives; and taking into account the overarching situation. Meanwhile; push for stronger online defenses comes as their doctrine to the growing role of cyber operations in modern warfare. Cyber attribution; based on analysis of network forensics; host forensics; and malware analysis is one of the best techniques to identify the actor of a cyber activity. By long-term collection of cyber activities with known actors and targets; it is natural to create a dataset for these massive data and use AI approaches to predict the attacking team. The objectives are as follows: Extracting most effective features to create cyber attribution profile Proposing a new model for cyber attribution,ArashHabibi Lashkari,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,,None
31940,Supporting Canadian Apprentices in the Construction and Industrial Sectors: Genetic and Epigenetic Analyses of Mental Health,We are proposing a novel gender-inclusive approach with a focus on understanding barriers faced by women; youth; and other underrepresented groups to increase recruitment; improve retention; expand and stabilize the construction and industrial workforces across Canada; and support employers. This study aims to parse the contributions of genetic and epigenetic variations in individuals at workplace to increase our understanding of the genesis of burnout and other occupational stressors as well as behavioral compatibility with jobs in the trade and additional traits such as tenacity. We will perform whole-genome analysis of genetic markers of the participants (apprentices) at the study entry. Furthermore; analysis of genome-wide methylation (epigenetics mechanisms) status and stress level of employers and apprentices at the study entry (Arm A - cross-sectional) and analysis of genome-wide methylation changes and stress levels in the employers and employees over one years (Arm B - longitudinal) will be performed. Arm A will be the preliminary step and Arm B will further investigate the temporal relationship among stress exposure and epigenetic changes. We hypothesize that different genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in burnout and other occupational stressors. The sample will consist of 100 participants (employers and apprentices in the Construction and Industrial Sectors). The participants will be recruited by the Ontario Electrical League (OEL). The burnout score will be measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be extracted from white blood cells. The genome-wide methylation levels will be measured using bisulfite conversion and the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit (Illumina Inc.; San Diego; US). Furthermore; whole-genome genotyping will be performed using the Illumina Omni 2.5-8 array at the Centre for Applied Genomics in Toronto (TCAG).,BehdinNowrouzi-Kia,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,-Strong data collection and analysis skills -Descriptive and inferential statistics A candidate with background in health professions and/or biological science or related with an understanding of the fundamentals of molecular genetics is highly desired,None
31941,Creating a functional profile of spasticity in the upper limb post stroke: Rehabilitation interventions following upper motor neuron syndrome,Spasticity is a common consequence of stroke; with a prevalence of 38% within the first year. One of the main features of spasticity is increased excitability of the stretch reflex (Lance; 1980); but it has also been characterized as altered sensorimotor control; featuring involuntary activation of muscles (Childers et al.; 2004). Occupational therapists play an important role in the treatment of spastic upper limb hemiparesis (Albany; 1997; Hoare & Imms; 2004). These treatments including splinting; casting; stretching; functional electrical stimulation; neuro developmental therapy; modified constraint-induced movement therapy; repetitive task training; strengthening exercises; and pain and swelling management (Dromerick; Edwards; & Hahn; 2000; Eftekhar; 2017; Gracies; 2001; Horgan et al.; 2017; Paci; 2003). Upper limb spasticity can interfere with function and cause pain and contractures. Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNTA) has been effectively used to reduce spasticity; however; the impact of BoNTA combined with rehabilitation on upper limb function is not clear. The study will have two phases. In phase 2; the learner will analyze data from a series of questionnaires that collected medical records of persons receiving BoNTA to reduce spasticity in upper and lower limbs. The information collected includes demographic (e.g.; age; gender; marital status; affected side; type of stroke; time since stroke ( first or second stroke; diagnosis; employment status and clinical characteristics (e.g.; time since stroke in years; affected side of body; type of stroke; targeted muscle groups; type of treatment receives; frequency of treatment; Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment hand or arm score; type of botulinum toxin; dosage (units). In phase II; learners will collect the abovementioned information using the questionnaire. Individuals with joint deformities and contractures; cognitive impairments; or an inability to follow instructions will be excluded from the study.,BehdinNowrouzi-Kia,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,-Strong data collection and analysis skills -Descriptive and inferential statistics,None
31942,Examining work disability and function in systematic lupus erythematosus,The project entitled Work disability and function in systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE): a national mixed-methods sequential explanatory study uses a multidisciplinary patient-centred collaborative practice to offer a practical solution that permits the delivery of complex care that can also be individualized. SLE is a multisystemic disease in which the body’s immune system attacks its organs resulting in disability and mortality; requiring a multidisciplinary approach for its management. Studies report that multidisciplinary teamwork in healthcare is associated with improved patient engagement and participation in their care processes in work rehabilitation3. Moreover; our national team and the participation of different centres across Canada is essential to provide insight into the breadth and depth of work disability and function in SLE and to enhance the external validity (generalizability) of this project findings. The multidisciplinary approach is aimed at improving patient care and avoiding miscommunication between various patients as much as possible1. Using a multidisciplinary team approach has shown successful outcomes in the management of chronic kidney disease; diabetes; and rheumatoid arthritis. The examination of work disability and function in SLE necessitates the recognition of the complexity; multidimensionality; temporal dimensions of SLE and its relationship to work and warrants a multidisciplinary perspective. Nevertheless; there is a dearth of evidence regarding the use of a multidisciplinary team approach in improving work disability and functional outcomes in patients with SLE. This project proposes a collaborative team approach to create a functional profile of work disability. Furthermore; it will benefit from a stellar multidisciplinary research team that includes expertise in epidemiology; patient education; medicine; knowledge mobilization; quantitative; and qualitative methods. The research team members have clinical backgrounds in nursing; occupational therapy; psychology; psychiatry; rheumatology and social work.,BehdinNowrouzi-Kia,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Interest and academic background in occupational public health; descriptive and inferential statistics.

31943,Characterization of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in plant oil biosynthesis,Triacylglycerols (TAGs; also known as vegetable oils) are the major form of carbon and energy storage in most oleaginous plants and have been widely used as food; feed; and sustainable feedstock for fuel and green chemical production. In plants; the terminal steps of TAG biosynthesis are catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT). These enzymes are important in determining the flux of carbon into TAG and thus have been the targets of numerous studies to bioengineer oil production. Recently; we found DGAT and PDAT may interact with some lipid enzymes and form spatially distinct interactomes for efficient substrate channeling to TAG. This project will further identify protein interactors of DGAT/PDAT; characterize the nature of the possible interactomes and investigate whether/how they affect lipid biosynthesis; with the long-term goal of improving our understanding of oil biosynthesis and eventually developing tailor-made photosynthetic organisms for oil production targeting food; biofuel and green chemicals.,YangXu,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-06,Students with molecular biology and/or biochemistry background are preferred.,None
31944,A phenomenological study of the lived experiences of intimate partner violence among disabled women in Newfoundland,The aim of this research project is to explore the lived experiences of intimate partner violence among self-identified disabled women in Newfoundland. In this study; disability is defined as any long-term physical; intellectual; or sensory impairment that may hinder individuals’ full participation in society. This research is inspired by the findings of a qualitative meta-synthesis that revealed a significant gap in the empirical literature related to the experiences of intimate partner violence among disabled women in Atlantic Canada. This qualitative study is informed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA); a methodological approach for exploring how participants make sense of their world and their experiences. A service user advisory group will provide consultation on various aspects of the research project; including the conceptual and design phases of the study. Following an ethics review and approval; approximately twenty disabled women in Newfoundland who are survivors of intimate partner violence will be recruited for an in-depth; semi-structured interview. Interviews will be conducted in person and virtually. Participants will be asked to share experiences related to their understanding and experience of intimate partner violence; the impact on themselves and their children (if applicable); their coping strategies; decision-making related to seeking help; and life after the relationship. The interviews will be transcribed and coded thematically using data analysis and management software guided by the analysis principles of IPA. The study findings will be disseminated in academic spaces; local community organizations; and service user groups. One manuscript will be authored and submitted to an academic journal for consideration. In addition; a knowledge synthesis report and infographic will be designed and shared with local community organizations and service user groups. A presentation of best practices for service providers will be presented at the local women’s centre.,AmiGoulden,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-01,,None
31945,Smart Self-Cleaning Antimicrobial Coatings,I propose to create a new class of hybrid antimicrobial materials that will effectively repulse or kill and repel a variety of pathogenic bacteria; viruses; and fungi. Moreover; the chromogenic nature of these coatings will enable simple visual colorimetric assessment of the level of the contamination; relative cleanness of the surface and indicate the need for the replacement and cleaning the material. We will use a molecularly defined approach to create surfaces based on covalently attached multifunctional organometallic monolayers on conductive supports that decrease initial adhesion; growth; and proliferation of cells. Moreover; simple and energy-efficient electrochemical stripping will allow additional cleaning of the surfaces.,OlenaZenkina,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-07-08,,None
31946,Coordination based assemblies for electrochromic (EC), electro-optic, and photonic materials. (1),Coordination based SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) will be prepared and examined as robust functional EC materials and in molecular electronics. We will prepare a series of nitrogenous ligand -Fe2+ type materials covalently anchored on an appropriate support (TiO2; WO2; FTO/on glass; or silicon). Subsequently; we will fine-tune the colour of our assemblies by rational ligand modification.Varying the number of pyridine moieties and changing the nature of the organic functionalities in one or several pyridine rings; (introducing a conjugated organic moiety or fused aromatic ring); or metal moiety will significantly affect metal to ligand (M-L) charge transfer and as a result change the colour of the metal complex. Through this approach; we will access different colours (red to blue). From preliminary results with terpyridine-Fe2+ SAM covalently immobilized on FTO/glass; electrochemical switching the oxidation state from Fe2+ to Fe3+ results in complete decolouration of the material. We will explore chemical and electrochemical switching properties; stability; conductivity and colour efficiency of these novel materials. The ultimate goal will be to create applicable EC materials with high coloration efficiency; colour homogeneity; high contrast ratios and controllable switching time. Changes in molecular design and deposition procedures (SA in solution and vacuum deposition) will be used to explore different arrangements on the surface. Structural factors such as length and bulkiness of the organic spacer; sterics and electronics; and the nature of the metal moiety; will be varied in order to investigate their influence on the packing density and properties of the SAMs. Finally; molecular wire-like highly conductive materials on activated silicon surface could be achieved using vinyl-terminated molecules.,OlenaZenkina,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-07-08,Preferably upper year chemistry student with chemical background (Organic and Inorganic; Materials; Analytical or Instrumental chemistry) and good synthetic skills.

31947,Preparation of functional materials on the surface for detection of metal ions (1),In this project; visiting exchange student will work closely with other lab members; on the synthesis of novel ligands and their deposition on surfaces. We will determine binding affinities and establish stoichiometry of the coordination of the ligand to a variety of metal ions. Self-assembled monolayers formed from these novel ligands will be further interacted with aqueous solutions of suitable metalloproteins. The exchange students who advance this research will learn organic; inorganic; analytical; physical; and surface chemistry; will get strong experience in applying their knowledge to design new materials starting from synthesis of molecular building blocks; assembly them using various binding motifs; and analyze the optical response of the developed sensor interacting with a variety of analytes. Metal binding affinities; surface coverage; porosity; stability; electrocatalytic; redox; electrochromic and spectroscopic properties will be optimized. Chemical modification of the ligand will allow for the incorporation of metals of different sizes that will define the hydration shell and as a result; the properties of the SAM. Various functional motifs could be introduced into one multidentate ligand to simultaneously detect different metals and allow real-time simultaneous detection and quantification of various analytes in multicomponent systems. Once the binding and detection of single metal ions are well understood on support; we will then prepare sensing arrays able to analyze multicomponent systems. Mixed molecular assemblies with a homogeneous distribution of key functionalities will be prepared by 1) co-deposition; when few functionalities competitively absorbed on the same solid support; or 2) stepwise deposition where large templating molecule are pre-deposited on support and then smaller molecules fill available space on the surface. Controlled ‘molecular printing” on the solid support with an appropriate mask or direct-write bottom-up deposition will be used to create sensing arrays with pre-designed patterns and properties.,OlenaZenkina,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-07-08,Preferably chemistry student with some background in chemistry (Organic and Inorganic; Analytical or Instrumental chemistry).,None
31948,Evolution and speciation in birds,Past MITACS students have worked on a variety of projects and I try to involve the student when deciding on the specific project to make it more meaningful. Most of the projects use molecular markers to look at population genetics either of a single species or closely related species/subspecies. We examine how landscapes and behaviour influence dispersal and can ultimately lead to speciation. Most of the projects are on land birds; however; some are on seabirds. Some of the project will involve field work; a great way to see the animals in their natural setting and to see a bit of the country. Some of the projects also involve genome sequencing.,TheresaBurg,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,No skills available,None
31949,How has domestication affected the brain?,The process of domestication has dramatically changed the behaviour and anatomy of many animal species that are used by humans for production purposes; lab animals or pets. Of the many widespread changes that occur in domesticated animals relative to their wild counterparts; one that has largely escaped detailed investigation is changes to the brain. Domesticated animals typically have relatively smaller brains and brain regions compared with their wild ancestors and it has long been suggested that this is due primarily to a decrease in neuron numbers. However; recent studies in my lab suggest that the anatomical changes in the brains of domesticated animals are due to more complex changes. The successful applicant will build upon this work through the neuroanatomical analysis of domesticated species and their wild counterparts. Currently; we are working primarily on variation among pigeon breeds selected for unique behavioural or anatomical traits. The results of these studies will be important for understanding how human selection for traits can affect the brain and has implications for interpreting results from lab animals; the long-term success of captive breeding programs and the effects of domesticated animals interbreeding with wild animals.

31950,Sensory abilities of birds,Determining the sensory abilities of different animal species is crucial to understanding how they navigate their environments; find food and even interact with humans. Behavioural testing can; however; be costly; time consuming and difficult for many species. An alternative approach is to examine the anatomy of the sensory pathways in the brain responsible for detecting and discriminating among environmental stimuli. Using this approach; my lab has made several major discoveries in how birds perceive their environment. For example; turkey vultures have enormous olfactory systems that enable them to find dead animals before other scavengers arrive and hummingbirds have enlarged very specific visual nuclei in the brain that process how the direction and speed at which they move. These discoveries rely on sophisticated microscopy equipment in our lab as well as access to our extensive brain collection. Currently our focus is on the visual and auditory systems of falcons and hawks. Working with wildlife rehabilitators; we have a variety of falcon and hawk species in our anatomical collection. The primary question we want to address is how vision and hearing abilities vary among falcon and hawk species in relation to behaviour by examining their anatomy in detail. This project is ideal for students interested in learning about brain anatomy and the skills are transferable to medicine; veterinary medicine; biomedical sciences and scientific research.,AndrewIwaniuk,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-13,The successful applicant should be undertaking a degree in biology; psychology or medicine and have some basic wet lab skills; such as using pipettes and electronic balances.

31952,History of Science in Science Education: exploring new frontiers through the study of elementary students' identities,Addressing Nature of Science (NOS) and History of Science (HOS) in science education has been recognized as beneficial for developing students' decision-making abilities and their comprehension of scientific processes. However; recent research noted that going beyond knowledge acquisition and considering the power dynamics and subjectivities at play is essential. This project seeks to bridge this gap by applying an identity lens to NOS research. By exploring the intersection of students' identities and NOS/HOS approaches in a grade 8 science class; this research aims to deepen our understanding of how historical approaches can shape students' perspectives on science. The ultimate goal is; clinging to the socio-political turn in science education; to enhance science education by empowering students to critically engage with science; recognize their own subjectivities; and participate in social transformation. The primary objective of this study is to explore how a historical approach in a grade 8 science class can mobilize students' identities when addressing NOS-related discussions and to develop a pilot research tool to characterize the relationship between students' identities and NOS themes. The second objective includes a comprehensive evaluation of how this project could be done in the future in BC schools. Main data will be collected in Brazilian schools; through interviews; observations; class material and recordings; which will be analyzed using qualitative research techniques. As for the second objective; steps will include: mapping the new BC science curriculum in its potential connections to the HOS/NOS; analysis of the structure of schools in Burnaby district; analysis of teacher education programs in BC with regard to its engagement with and common teacher materials in BC schools in regard to the inclusion of History of Science.,CristianoBarbosa de Moura,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-07-01,Candidates for this position should: - Have completed at least 2/5 of the course credits of a science teacher education program by the time of the internship; - Have an interest in the History of Science and/or have completed an informal or formal course in the History of Science; - Be proactive; curious; and independent and has to have an interest in pursuing research in science education. - Have a good command of English and Portuguese languages.,None

The goal of the project is to monitor small molecules like; chemotherapeutics; antibiotics; drug of abuse or neurotransmitters using aptamer-based biosensors. This sensing platform uses a surface-attached aptamer (a DNA sequence specific for a molecular target) receptor modified with a redox reporter; which; following target recognition can undergo a binding-induced change in electrochemical signal measured using a potentiostat. To test the usefulness of the sensors; sensors are miniaturized and immersed directly in the relevant matrix (i.e.; saliva; urine; blood; cerebral spinal fluid; etc.).,PhilippeDauphin Ducharme,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Good laboratory practice are required from the student.

31954,Understanding biotrophic plant pathogens,Clubroot is a devastating disease infecting roots of plants of the Brassicaceae family and responsible for 10–15% yield reduction on a global scale. The clubroot pathogen; Plasmodiophora brassicae; is an obligate intracellular biotroph that belongs to the class Phytomyxea. The life cycle of P. brassicae starts in the soil; where resting spores; which can remain viable for up to 20 years; germinate in response to the presence of plant hosts and initiate primary infection. During secondary infection; susceptible plants develop galls that disrupt water and nutrient uptake; leading to wilting; stunting; and; in some instances; death of the infected plant. The mechanisms by which the clubroot pathogen can escape plant immunity in the susceptible host and induce the root galls characteristics of the disease is still unknown. Based on what we know about biotrophic pathogens from other evolutionary groups; effector proteins might play a key role in mediating P. brassicae pathogenicity. Prediction of effectors based on conserved motifs has been very challenging for this pathogen; mainly because of unique features inherent to P. brassicae; including its inability to grow in axenic cultures. This scarcity of information about P. brassicae effectors stresses the need to find other ways to assess more effector candidates to better understand the etiology of the clubroot pathogen. That is precisely one of the projects being developed in our lab; the characterization of P. brassicae effector candidates to study their function during the infection. For that we use biochemistry; molecular biology and microbiology methodologies. We will also generate Arabidopsis plants expressing the effectors in order to investigate if these proteins can affect plant immunity and response to pathogens.,EdelPerez Lopez,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The main skill required from the student is curiosity; critical thinking and love for science.

31956,Transparent and flexible "plastic" solar cells for portable applications,Solar cells commercialized to date can be divided in two categories: i) high-cost high-efficiency devices from crystalline inorganic materials and ii) low-cost low-efficiency ones from cheap; disordered materials. Increasing the market for solar energy by developing lightwight and portable devices at high-efficency and low-cost is vital to enhance competitiveness with respect of non-renewable energy sources. Organic mixtures of fullerenes (spheroidal molecules entirely formed by carbon atoms) and electrically semiconducting polymers (a discovery awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize for Chemistry) are extremely promising as low-cost materials for flexible "plastic" solar-cells. When mixed together; conducting polymers and fullerenes are intense light absorbers; with record efficencies over 10% in solar-cell prototypes. Additionally; they are low-density; soft; and easily bendable; which is essential to fabricate flexible; lightweight and portable photovoltaics on inexpensive plastic substrates. In order to further increase their performance; it is essential for us to understand how particles carrying opposite electrical charges; which are generated in extraordinary amounts by illuminating these materials; can be even more efficiently dissociated at the interface between organic semiconducting polymers and fullerenes; and therefore transformed into electrical currents. The process is known as profoundly different from its counterpart in "standard" inorganic and cystalline solar-cell materials; such as; for example; p-type and n-type silicon--the most popular commercial solar-cell material to date; which; however; is neither cheap; nor lightweight; nor flexible. In this project; the student(s) will fabricate organic photovoltaics with active layers of polymer-fullerene and characterize them; both with standard techniques (a solar simulator and a photoconversion efficency estimator) and unique superresolution tools (scanning near-field optical microscopy available in Fanchini's lab) where polymer aggregates and fullerene clusters of few hundred nm's can be independently illuminated and probed. The objective is to shed light on the photodissociation mechanisms at the nanoscale; and optimize them towards more efficient organic photovoltaics.,GiovanniFanchini,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,The student(s) expected for this project will have a solid background in Physics; and/or Electrical Engineering and/or Engineering Physics or Materials Science and/or Chemistry.

31958,Computational platform for materials screening and engineering,The utilisation of computer modelling in exploration of novel materials is much less common. The material modelling is often limited to interpretation of experimental observations; rather than facilitating the discovery of materials with properties tailored to specific applications. The success of a computer-aided material design approach relies on the ability of a model to relate the atomic structure of novel compounds to their properties and eventually to device characteristics from first principles. This project will contribute to the advancement of quantum mechanical approaches for the simulation and invention of novel functional materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications (including solar cells; light emitting diodes; and lasers); energy materials (batteries; supercapacitors); quantum materials. The goal is to develop and test accuracy of a high-throughput computational platform that takes an atomic structure of a material as an input and predicts its relevant functional properties as the output in an automated manner. For instance; this can be a charge potential for the battery; of a band gap and effective mass for a transparent conductive oxide. This development will improve cost effectiveness of the materials design by reducing the number of trial and error experimental realisations thereby accelerating technological advances through analysis and simulation of novel materials; which allows the assessment of their potential at an early stage.,OlegRubel,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-13,Knowledge of electronic materials; solid-state physics; computer modelling and programming; Lunix operating system,None

31960,The role of the R2TP complex in protein homeostasis (1),RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 helicases are two related and highly conserved members of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA+) superfamily. They were recently identified independently by multiple groups and have been shown to be essential for viability and development of several model organisms including S. cerevisiae; D. melanogaster; and X. laevis. They are coexpressed and are thought to mainly function together in a large number of cellular processes. The importance of these helicases is that they have been found to be critical components of several key multiprotein complexes including the chromatin remodeling complexes INO80 and SWR-C; the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex; and the telomerase complex. RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 were also found to be involved in snoRNA maturation and pre-rRNA processing. Significantly; the helicases have recently been implicated in carcinogenesis. The transcription of genes of both proteins were found to be dysregulated in several cancers such as liver; bladder; and melanoma. Importantly; it has been shown that decreased expression of RUVBL1 or RUVBL2 results in reduced tumor cell growth and increased apoptosis in vitro. These observations strongly indicate that RUVBL1/RUVBL2 could be therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Nevertheless; the biological activity and the molecular mechanism of their function remains poorly understood. Based on a large-scale proteomics effort; WAH’s group identified two highly conserved novel Hsp90 interactors that were named RPAP3 and PIH1D1; which bind to the chaperone and which also associate physically and functionally with the RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 helicases to form a highly conserved complex; which we termed the R2TP complex. We demonstrated that Hsp90 and the R2TP complex function to promote the proper biogenesis of several key protein complexes. Hence; we are interested in determining the structure and mechanism of funtion of the R2TP complex.,WalidHoury,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have working knowledge of protein purification and protein biophysical characterization.,None
31961,Role of the ATP-dependent Protein Degradation System ClpXP in Mitochondrial Protein Homeostasis (1),The mitochondrion generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress and result in damage to many mitochondrial proteins. Chaperones and proteases in the mitochondrion combat this damage. One of the main proteases in the mitochondrial matrix is the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease. Both ClpX and ClpP are nuclear encoded proteins that are translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. ClpXP is well-studied in many bacterial species; but very little is known of its functions in mammalian cells. However; mitochondrial ClpXP has been found to play an important role in activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response; UPRmt. ClpXP upregulation has been implicated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and ClpXP has been suggested to play a role in Parkinson's disease. Hence; we are interested in using biochemical and biophysical approaches to determine the activity and selectivity of human ClpXP. We are also interested in determining the physiological function of human ClpXP in the cell.,WalidHoury,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The student will be required to have working knowledge of protein purification and protein biophysical characterization.,None
31962,The Development of Novel Antibiotics_Clone (1),In recent years; there has been an alarming trend of increased bacterial infections caused by strains resistant to most known drugs. As a result; diseases that were thought to be controlled by currently available antibiotics are re-emerging not only in developing countries but also in industrialized nations; especially in clinical settings such as hospitals. Therefore; there is an urgent need for the development of new types of antibiotics that can be used to effectively treat multidrug resistant bacteria. In this project; we propose to screen and develop a novel class of antibacterial drugs that can activate highly-conserved; tightly-regulated; self-compartmentalizing cylindrical proteases in bacterial cells. One such protease is ClpP. On its own; ClpP can only degrade small peptides and not folded proteins. The binding of unfoldase chaperones to ClpP is required for the degradation of native proteins. ClpP has recently been validated as a novel molecular target for antibacterial drug development. We aim to develop and identify novel compounds that allow ClpP and other such cylindrical proteases to indiscriminately degrade folded proteins eventually causing bacterial cell death. The efficacy of the compounds will be tested using model infectious bacterial systems.

31963,Modeling for increasing rate of genetic gain in pulse crops,Common bean is an important pulse crop worldwide and it is a staple for human populations across the developing world. We use computational tools to simulate the outcomes of plant breeding programs and determine the most likely scenarios that deliver on the goals of plant breeders. We hypothesize that there is room for improvement in increasing the historical rate of genetic gain in pulse crops; such as common bean. Therefore; the objective of this project is to create a framework for the simulation of every detail of multiple types of breeding programs and determine the rate of genetic gain as a result of each one across time. We are also interested in testing the if genotype x environment interactions play a role in the maximization of genetic gain and broad adaptation of individuals developed using different breeding program schemes.,ValerioHoyos-Villegas,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,,None
31964,Development of new training population sampling methods using machine learning tools,One of the main ways to make processes in plant breeding more efficient is the use of genomewide selection (GS). GS uses markers across the genome to determine the genetic merit of an individual within a large breeding population. GS depends heavily on the accuracy between two groups. One group is the training population; characterized by genotypic information (DNA markers) and phenotypic information (from the field). The second group is the inference population; comprised of only DNA marker information. Constructing a sufficiently accurate and robust training population is difficult; and as generations advance this accuracy potentially breaks down. We want to explore the use of statistical modeling and potentially machine learning tools to construct training populations that result in high accuracy with minimal breakdown. The hypothesis here is that a "guided" (either with model validation tools or machine learning) construction of a training population can be much more reliable than the current standard which is random sampling. For this purpose; we have DNA markers available and phenotypic information from common bean and chickpea cultivars. Our interest is to develop code and potentially a tool that is available to the wider plant breeding community and further improved using collaborative coding tools.,ValerioHoyos-Villegas,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,This project will require a student that is capable of coding in R or python and can use UNIX/Bash to conduct modeling and population simulation in a high-performance computing environment.

31965,Improvement of standard methods for enhancing pulse grain quality,Pulses are among the most important foods for human nutrition worldwide. They comprise the primary staple for over 2 billion people in the developing world and are highly relevant for the diets of over 100 million people in the developed world. The project will involve studying novel phenotyping methods for the assessment of quality traits in pulses. We are interested in developing a low cost method for the standardization of protein in dry bean and pea samples. The objective of this work is to calibrate an NIR model for the determination of protein in dry bean and protein and and oil in dry pea. The project may also extend into standardization of the method into canned samples of dry beans and peas. Depending on the progress; the project will also extend into genetic variation as the measurements will be undertaken on a Mesoamerican diversity panel of dry beans of approximately 300 lines which are already genotyped with single nucleotide polymorphisms. For genetic analysis; a genome-wide association study will be incorporated into the internship. The intern will learn skills in field plant breeding; experimental design; coding and statistical and genetic analysis.,ValerioHoyos-Villegas,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-04-30,Basic genetics Basic statistics Basic computer skills; basic coding skills useful but not required.

31967,Systems biology approaches to study interbacterial interactions,Projects in the lab use high-throughput approaches; including systems biology and functional genomics; to study the metabolism and physiology of bacteria in contexts that are relevant during infections. Our goal is to define novel potential targets that could help the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. In particular; we are interested in understanding interbacterial interactions; for instance between bacterial pathogens and bacteria from the microbiota. We use single-gene deletion collections to define genes that are essentials during these interactions. We believe that theses genes represent possible targets and will be useful to design novel antimicrobial strategies. Our model organisms are Escherichia coli; Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During this project; the selected intern will be in charge of confirming and characterizing some genetic interactions from our high-throughput screens.

31970,Loneliness, Privacy and Social Robots,This research project will create a dialogue between programmers (beginning with student programmers and ultimately consumer-programmers) with target user groups (e.g. caregivers of seniors; then seniors themselves) to assess levels of trust in social robots that are executing programs designed to help address loneliness through either interaction with the robot alone or as a means to connect the user to other people. Programmers will receive a two-pronged mandate: 1) Design a program for a social robot that will adapt to and engage with a user seeking companionship and/or connection to their community (or for whom a caregiver has provided the robot for these purposes); 2) Programmers will either be instructed to foreground user privacy; or to ignore it. These programs will be demonstrated to potential users participating in the study; either in person or through an informational video. In the research project; we will assess the reactions and impressions of potential users to these programs; in order to examine the effects of factors such as: pre-formed attitudes toward social robots; personalization features of the program; ability of the program to connect the user to the broader online or offline community; user assessment of the privacy risks of the program; amount and quality of information users perceive about the data collection features of the program; level of understanding of current data protection obligations in Canada; perceived needs potentially met by the program; and demographic differences; including especially cultural differences. This research project will collect data from user participants via a demographic questionnaire combined with individual interviews. The interviews will be analyzed using a mixed method qualitative approach; including inductive analysis techniques; as well as narrative analysis to unpack the way that participants situate themselves in relation to the role the robot might play in their lives.,PatrickHung,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-04-30,The students should have a background in Business; Social Science or Computer Science/Information Technology.,None
31971,Research on the Psychology of Cleanliness,Physical cleansing removes more than physical residues; it produces psychological consequences across numerous domains. For example; washing or wiping hands reduces the influence of prior immoral experience (Zhong & Liljenquist; 2006); dissonance about a prior decision (Lee & Schwarz; 2010); recent good or bad luck (Xu; Zwick; & Schwarz; 2012); pessimism from a failure (Kaspar; 2012); and so on. But what mechanism may account for such diverse effects? The theoretical challenge here is that there is little content overlap among these domains (morality; dissonance; luck; failure). Is it possible to explain them all in a unified account? We propose an integrative mechanism to account for these diverse effects: cleansing activates a mental procedure that temporarily removes psychological residues of any kind from the mind. This mechanism has a range of novel implications; two of which are tested in the present research project. Specifically; cleansing (vs. no cleansing) should make events that occur prior to it more psychologically distant and abstract (Trope & Liberman; 2003; 2010) but events that occur subsequent to it more psychologically close and concrete (Study 1; N = 80). Because construing an event in abstract rather than concrete terms tends to involve fewer affective components; cleansing (vs. no cleansing) should lower the affective intensity of prior events but heighten that of subsequent events (Study 2; N = 160). In short; cleansing may help people down-regulate their emotions associated with the past and up-regulate their experience of the present. To test both hypotheses; we will conduct two experimental studies during the 12-week internship. Participants will be recruited from the university campus to complete the studies. Results will be analyzed and evaluated for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal.,Spike W.

31972,Research on Abstract Thinking and Metaphorical Mind-Body Relations,"Dirty" thoughts; "warm" personality; "heavy" topic; "bright" future. Abstract thinking is often grounded in metaphorically associated bodily experiences with the physical world. But what psychological mechanisms underlie all of these diverse groundings? We propose an integrative framework to account for the causal effects of bodily states on people's judgments and behaviors. The framework assumes that each bodily state activates its metaphorically associated feeling; concept; goal; and procedure. This internship will investigate two predictions made by the framework; focusing on the role of physical cleansing as a bodily procedure of separating information of the past from the present task at hand. Study 1 (N = 80): Creativity. Participants will first read a story that includes words from a Remote Association Task (RAT; Mednick; 1962). Then they will either use or examine a wipe. Next; they will complete 15 RAT sets; each showing three words (e.g.; sore; shoulder; sweat) and asking for a word that logically links them (answer: cold). We predict that using (vs. examining) the wipe will increase the number of RAT sets completed. Study 2 (N = 160): Problem Solving. Participants will be told at the beginning that they have to solve 10 problems; the accuracy and efficiency at which will reflect their cognitive abilities. Right before they begin; they will either use or examine a wipe. In actuality; they will only solve one problem; the Duncker candle problem (Duncker; 1945); where the solution requires creative use of objects beyond their usual functions. We predict that using (vs. examining) the wipe will result in higher likelihood and shorter time of successfully solving the problem.,Spike W.

31973,Research on the Physical Foundations of Moral Foundations,The past 10 years have witnessed a rapidly expanding body of behavioral research that reveals a set of five innate; universal foundations; from which all cultures build their moral intuitions (Haidt & Graham; 2007). But cultures and groups differ in their relative emphases on the different foundations. For example; while both liberals and conservatives emphasize care/harm and fairness/cheating; conservatives give additional emphasis to loyalty/betrayal; authority/subversion; and sanctity/degradation (Graham; Haidt; & Nosek; 2009). Although these moral foundations have been shown to predict economic behaviors and political attitudes; it remains entirely unclear how they are represented in the human mind. Without understanding how the mind processes moral foundations; the theory has difficulty in extending its explanatory scope and predictive accuracy. Our research addresses this critical gap of knowledge. Drawing on insights from grounded cognition (Lee; 2016; Lee & Schwarz; 2014; 2016); we propose that the abstract meaning of each moral foundation (care/harm; fairness/unfairness; loyalty/betrayal; authority/subversion; sanctity/degradation) is represented; processed; and interpreted through a specifically mapped domain of physical experience. In two small-scale pilot studies and one large-scale experiment; we will test the causal influence of five bodily experiences on people’s attitudes towards the five moral foundations and on people’s monetary decisions driven by each foundation. Confirmatory results will provide the first evidence for the physical foundations of moral foundations.,Spike W.

31975,Pathways for the decarbonization of process heat in Alberta,The increasing concerns of climate change and the need to limit the global temperature increase below 1.5oC above the pre-industrial levels requires us to make a significant shift in the way we generate and use energy. Industry processes are among the significant energy users giving rise higher levels of CO2 emissions since most of the industry process heat comes from the burning of fossil fuels. A number of technologies are considered to have the potential for the decarbonization of process heat. These include high temperature heat pumps; geothermal energy; solar thermal among others. However; the applicability of these technologies for different process heat requirements has not been widely studied. Moreover; there are limited studies that have considered the performance of such technologies under realistic operating conditions in Alberta. This project seeks to identify the industry process heat needs and develop concepts for meeting these needs using clean; renewable; and sustainable energy technologies. Among the technologies that will be evaluated include the use of geothermal energy; use of electric resistance heating; use of high temperature heat pumps; concentrating solar thermal and combinations of two or more of these systems. Applying the fundamental engineering laws; the performance of the developed concepts will be evaluated; and their technical and economic feasibility established. Besides; models to determine the long-term performance of these systems will be developed and evaluated.,AggreyMwesigye,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,Completion of the fundamental courses in Thermodynamics; Heat Transfer and Fluid Mechanics is essential.

31976,Additive manufacturing of Ti-5553 alloy via wire arc deposition process,For a considerable time; titanium alloys have been the preferred materials in the aerospace industry due to their outstanding combination of physical and mechanical properties. So far; Ti-6Al-4V; an α+β alloy; has been predominantly used for aerospace applications; specifically in fuselage and engine components. However; there has been a growing interest in near-β Ti-alloys that have a two-phase microstructure comprising the hcp titanium α-phase and the bcc titanium β-phase. This is due to the various thermal and thermo-mechanical processing that can result in a wide range of mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of near-β Ti-alloys are highly influenced by their internal microstructure; which often comprises multiple phases and precipitates. The final mechanical properties can be significantly improved by forming fine and uniformly dispersed α precipitates in the parent β matrix. The presence of the ω phase in near-β Ti-alloys can significantly impact the size and distribution of the α phase. However; a high-volume fraction of the ω phase may cause embrittlement of the alloy due to the limited mobility of dislocations. As a result; a thorough understanding of the phase transformations and microstructural evolution is critical to optimizing the mechanical properties for different applications. The additive manufacturability of Ti-5553 alloy has not been studied extensively. Therefore; several samples were generated by depositing Ti-5553 wires on Ti-5553 plates from single-layer to multi-layer depositions while varying the deposition direction. The student needs to study the microstructures of the cross-sections of the different coupons via optical and electron microscope and determine the local mechanical properties; like hardness. The student also needs to perform some post-process heat treatments to modify the microstructure.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31977,Microstructural and mechanical property relationships in a near beta titanium alloy during various thermal treatments,Titanium alloys have been the material of choice for aerospace industries for a long-time due to their excellent combination of physical and mechanical properties. So far; Ti-6Al-4V; an α+β alloy has dominated the titanium use in aerospace applications; mostly in fuselage and engine components. But recently; near-β Ti-alloys have seen a lot of interest due to the possibility of a two-phase microstructure; consisting of the hcp titanium α-phase and the bcc titanium β-phase. Therefore; a wide range of mechanical properties can be achieved through various thermal and thermo-mechanical processing. The properties of near­β Ti­alloys are highly dependent on their internal microstructure; which often is composed of multiple phases and precipitates. The volume fraction; size; morphology; and distribution of these precipitates can significantly influence the final mechanical properties. Mechanical properties can be significantly improved with the formation of fine; uniformly dispersed α precipitates in the parent β matrix. The presence of the ω phase in near­β Ti­alloys may have significant influence on the size and distribution of α phase. Again; the presence of high volume fraction of ω may cause embrittlement of the alloy due to the limited mobility of dislocations. Therefore; a complete and detailed understanding on phase transformations and microstructural evolution are crucial to optimize the mechanical properties for various applications. Variations in the heat treatment parameters such as time; temperature; and cooling rate may form various volume fractions and morphologies of α-phase within the β-matrix. In this research program; various thermal processing parameters; precipitation kinetics; microstructural evolution through optical and electron microscopes will be addressed extensively. Finally; the effect of all these parameters and microstructural features on the global and local mechanical properties will be investigated.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31978,Fusion weldability of Al2024 alloy with the presence of TiC nanoparticles in the weld pool.,Aluminum Al2024 is widely used in the aircraft and automotive industries due to its excellent mechanical properties that are further improved by precipitation hardening through artificial aging. However; the presence of significant amounts of alloying elements makes this alloy vulnerable to solidification cracking during casting; fusion welding; and additive manufacturing; which limits its industrial applications. Although much research has been conducted to eliminate solidification cracks during fusion welding; it has mostly been reported to be only partially successful. Recently; the addition of nanoparticles in the melt pool during welding and additive manufacturing has been shown to be effective in completely eliminating solidification cracks in high-strength aluminum alloys such as Al7075. However; this approach has not yet been tested for Al2024 alloy; which is equally important in the aerospace and automotive industries. To address this gap in research; Al2024 sheets and TiC nanoparticles infused filler metal will be used to arc weld in the machine shop for characterization. Various weld parameters will be tested to reduce weld defects such as porosity and underfill. Coupons for metallography and tensile testing will be obtained by cutting the welds using an electrical discharge machining system. Optical and electron microscopes will be used to study the microstructures and defects; and tensile tests will be performed to determine the mechanical properties and soundness of the welds. Micro-indentation hardness testing will also be conducted to determine the local mechanical properties of the welds.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31979,Fusion weldability of Al6061 alloy with the presence of TiC nanoparticles in the weld pool.,Aluminum 6061 (Al6061) is a popular aluminum alloy known for its excellent strength and corrosion resistance; making it a common material choice for a wide range of applications. However; when it comes to fusion welding Al6061; there are specific considerations that need to be kept in mind. This is because high-strength aluminum alloys like Al6061 contain substantial amounts of alloying elements; making them prone to solidification cracking during casting; fusion welding; and additive manufacturing. This limits the use of these alloys in various industrial applications. To overcome this issue; much research has been conducted to eliminate solidification cracks during fusion welding. However; most of the reported methods have been found to only partially remove the cracks. Recently; a new technique has been introduced where nanoparticles are added to the melt pool during welding and additive manufacturing. This method has been reported to be effective in completely eliminating solidification cracks for high-strength aluminum alloys such as Al7075. The same technique has not been tested yet on Al6061; even though it holds significant importance in various industries.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

31980,Cartographie de la peur : examen des caractéristiques physiques et sociales d'une ville canadienne de taille moyenne,The project is situated at the intersection of criminology and sociology. The main objective of this research is to analyze the physical and social factors that contribute to feelings of insecurity and fear in a medium-sized Canadian city. The City of Moncton is experiencing significant demographic changes: in the last 10 years; its population has increased by 20%. These changes are affecting the social dynamics of the area. The City of Moncton is experiencing significant demographic changes: in the last 10 years; its population has increased by 20%. These changes are affecting the social dynamics of the area. An increase in property crime rates has been coupled with a sense of insecurity reported by the local media. To conduct this study; we are using data from an online survey conducted in the spring of 2022. Analysis of this data will map areas where nearly 400 respondents reported feeling uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. Data were collected at the individual level; but also at the selected area level. The survey builds a mind map of insecurity and other related issues that is very useful for this project. First; it will examine the social factors that contribute to respondents' feelings of fear: gender; age; ethno-cultural background; socioeconomic status; relationship to these spaces; experiences of victimization; etc. Second; the physical characteristics of places identified as unsafe will be examined: buildings; green spaces; streets and sidewalks to name a few. By understanding how these factors interact with perceptions of insecurity; the project can help develop more effective public policies to enhance safety in the city. This research is therefore crucial to understanding the factors that contribute to the feeling of insecurity in cities and to developing effective solutions to improve the quality of life for people who use these spaces.,VeroniqueChadillon-Farinacci,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The student must have skills in quantitative and qualitative research methodology; data analysis; and mapping.

31981,Metabolic and inflammatory outcomes of the ketogenic diet comparing saturated and unsaturated fat sources,Canola has tremendous economic importance to Canada with 20.8 million acres under cultivation in 2020; and a total value of $26 billion. The USA Food and Drug Administration allows canola oil to carry a qualified health claim for reduction of coronary heart disease when substituted for saturated fat. Very low-carbohydrate diets; also called ketogenic diets (KETO) are popular for weight loss and are gaining interest as a treatment for diabetes because they may reduce the requirement for drugs to control blood sugar. However; KETO are often high in saturated fats; which may increase cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors. Substituting heart-healthy canola oil for saturated fats may improve these outcomes. We aim to compare glucose response; cholesterol and inflammation in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes after following KETO for 6 months compared with a third group consuming a standard diet recommended by Diabetes Canada. One KETO group will receive a supply of canola oil (KETO-Can); the other group will receive a supply of saturated fats (KETO-Sat); while the control group will consume a low-fat diet focused on whole grains. We expect that the results will support the hypothesis that outcomes; particularly cholesterol and inflammatory markers; will be improved in the KETO-Can group relative to the KETO-Sat group. The important outcomes including glucose response; triglyceride (TG); total cholesterol (C); LDL-C; apolipoproteinB100 (ApoB100); inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP); (adipo)cytokines and T- and B-cell populations of the immune system will be measured at baseline; 3 and 6 months.

31982,Searching for plant cell surface receptor function,Plants use a large family of cell-surface receptors to sense environmental cues; most of which have no demonstrated biological function. One of the main aims of our lab is to assign function to these orphan receptors; using classical methods in addition to high-throughput screening and network analysis. We currently have a collection of about 200 mutant lines of the experimental plant Arabidopsis; each of which lacks a single member of this large gene family. To identify candidate functions for these receptors we will screen these mutants for abnormal responses to pathogen signals or other stresses. When a mutant shows an altered phenotype or response; we can infer that the missing receptor plays a role in the biological pathway that relates to the applied stress. The receptors that you identify will then be carefully analyzed to determine how the receptor functions as well as identifying the other plant molecules involved in that pathway.,AdamMott,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-06-03,The ideal candidate will have a background in any of the following areas: plant biology; cell and molecular biology; plant immunology; or plant stress biology.

31983,Do prophage aid in colonization of the tick vector by the Lyme disease spirochete?,Borrelia burgdorferi encodes numerous prophages that have long been known to be associated with primary skin and tick isolates. Additionally; we have identified B. burgdorferi phages in the midguts of B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. However; the importance of these prophages in the tick vector has not been explored. Therefore; we seek to determine the function of the B. burgdorferi prophages in the I. scapularis tick vector by defining their influence on the tick microbiome. Previous data has shown that I. scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi have a lower prevalence of Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas when compared to B. burgdorferi-free I. scapularis. We will investigate this observation further in the context of the B. burgdorferi prophages and determine if these prophages are lytic to Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas by in vitro plaque assays of purified B. burgdorferi prophage. We believe that the conservation of B. burgdorferi prophages in Lyme disease Borrelia and the detection of prophages in the midgut implies the necessity of B. burgdorferi prophages during the natural enzootic cycle. Therefore; our hypothesis is that B. burgdorferi prophages allow these spirochetes to establish a niche among the symbiotic microorganisms of the tick vector. We will investigate this hypothesis by determining the lytic properties of prophages on common tick symbionts. Time permitting; we would also like to explore and characterize the prophage genes responsible for bacterial lysis.,JennyWachter,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,Knowledge in performing a wide variety of complex procedures and techniques which may include; but are not limited to: microbial cell culture and basic manipulations; proper aseptic technique; phage isolation and purification; phage plaque assays; PCR amplification of gene sequences; design of synthetic genes; gene cloning; bacterial transformations; gel electrophoresis; DNA analysis; DNA isolation; DNA purification; DNA sequencing; DNA gel purification; protein purification and analysis; western blots; PAGE; knowledge in presenting and interpreting data.,None

31986,Fusion weldability of Al2024-Al7075 dissimilar alloys with the presence of TiC nanoparticles in the weld pool.,The two aluminum alloys; 2024 and 7075; are popular in the aerospace and automotive industries because of their exceptional mechanical properties. These properties can be further improved by precipitation hardening through artificial aging. However; the presence of multiple alloying elements in these alloys makes them highly prone to solidification cracking during casting; fusion welding; and additive manufacturing; which restricts their widespread industrial applications. Researchers have been exploring various methods to eliminate solidification cracks during fusion welding; but most of them have only been partially successful. One recent technique that has shown promising results is the addition of nanoparticles to the melt pool during additive manufacturing of Al7075. Although both alloys are widely used; joining them together has been limited primarily to solid-state welding methods. Techniques such as friction stir welding; explosive welding; and diffusion bonding are often used for joining dissimilar aluminum alloys; but they also have limitations in terms of the size and shape of the objects that can be welded. For instance; friction stir welding requires a relatively flat and straight welding path and is restricted to welding thin sections of aluminum alloys. Diffusion bonding is a time-consuming process that requires high temperatures and pressure and is limited to small components. The fusion weldability of these two alloys in the presence of nanoparticles has not yet been studied. This presents an opportunity for further research into the potential use of nanoparticles in overcoming the solidification cracking issue and expanding the possibilities for fusion welding these two dissimilar alloys.

31987,Robust study on Detection, Identification and Characterization of Microplastics in wastewater treatment systems,MPs reach wastewater treatment plants through domestic and industrial wastewater making plants (WWTPs) the potential sink of MPs. Improper treatment of MPs in WWTPs will release MPs again to the environment by releasing them into freshwater streams and through dewatered sludge MPs also end up in landfills. Hence; WWTPs are a significant point sources of MPs for both surface and soil. WWTPs are thus an ideal place to eliminate MPs from being an emerging contaminant. Samples from different stages in WWTPs will be collected and using different sample processing strategies MPs are extracted; isolated; and characterized from these samples. All the studies so far lacked a standard protocol for MPs analysis in wastewater samples. This research mainly focusses on the optimizing pre-techniques for efficient removal of organic matter from wastewater and wastewater sludge matrices to improve the MPs recovery and implementing advanced characterization techniques (FTIR; Raman; SEM; Microscope; DSC-TGA; py-GC/MS) to develop a sensitive; reproducible; and efficient detection and quantification methods for MPs in the WW matrix.

31988,Study of Microplastics (MPs) Weathering in wastewater treatment systems,The research project "Study of Microplastics (MPs) Weathering in wastewater treatment systems" aims to investigate the impact of weathering on microplastics in wastewater treatment systems with a specific focus on biological secondary treatment processes. Biological secondary treatment processes are widely used in wastewater treatment plants and rely on microorganisms to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. The project aims to develop a novel bioreactor design depicting suspended/hybrid systems and operational strategies for likely consequences of microplastic weathering in these systems; specifically focusing on biofilm-mediated MPs weathering. This bioreactor system will be used to investigate the impact of weathering on microplastics and the impact of MP weathering on the treatment efficiency of biological treatment processes and to develop operational strategies to optimize the treatment process and mitigate MP pollution the environment. The study will involve the collection of wastewater samples from WWTPs. These samples will be analyzed for microplastics and their characteristics; such as size; shape; and composition. The bioreactor system will then be used to simulate biological secondary treatment processes and investigate the impact of weathering on the removal efficiency of microplastics. The successful candidate will conduct experiments; analyze data; and prepare reports on their findings.

31989,Fighting superbugs: understanding microbial virulence and discovering novel antimicrobial solutions,Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has reached global disaster status; where existing antibiotics fail to treat infections. By 2050; 10 million people a year could die worldwide due to AMR; up from around 700;000 today. Infectious diseases pose a severe problem to health worldwide with a considerable social and economic burden. However; most research addressing this problem relies on testing isolated microbes under conventional lab conditions; which do not adequately represent the infection situation. These discrepancies likely lead to failure to capture the entire arsenal superbugs deploy during infection. The proposed research project addresses these knowledge gaps by uncovering the microbial weapons unleashed only during infection but not in traditional lab conditions; which will enable the discovery of novel therapeutics that disarm microbes from these weapons. The student will explore the microbial virulence phenotypes under conditions that mimic different infection situations. Virulence phenotypes include biofilm formation and response to host innate immune system and may involve testing under various in vivo infection models. The observed microbial responses will be characterized through interdisciplinary studies using microbiology; biochemistry; molecular biology; chemical biology; and advanced chemogenomics methodologies.

31991,Urban stormwater management: blue, green and grey solutions,The proportion of the global population exposed to flood risk is growing. Space is limited in urban centres; and it is challenging to meet the ambitious; but necessary; stormwater management objectives of LID (naturalized water balances; flood control and water quality management) in practice. Experience tells us that decision-makers; designers and other stakeholders are often required to combine the three types of stormwater infrastructure together: Blue (detention systems) are integrated with Green (vegetated systems) and Grey (conventional minor and major stormwater systems) stormwater infrastructure together.

31995,Chemical modifications of metallo-organic frameworks,Metallo-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recently developed by combining various metal and ligand combinations. Due to their many advantages they have found their way in application such as catalysis; energy; carbon dioxide conversion etc. However; it is still not well understood how MOFs can be chemically modified and if such modifications can be tailored without compromising the integrity of the MOF. In order to design materials for specific applications; the systematic study of MOFs nd their chemical modifications is needed. Hence; this project aims to evaluate how chemical modifications of MOFs affect their structure and properties. The MOFs of interest include those with luminescent metal cores; and pyrene-based ligands. The chemical modifications of MOFs will be carried out in four ways: a) by displacing metal center; b) by displacing ligand; c) by chemically modifying existing ligand; or d) by forming new coordination complexes within MOFs. The modification will change the metal and ligand content in MOF as well as change its morphology and optical properties. The expected outcomes of this project are to 1) determine how MOF modification affects structure and properties; and 2) identify the link between chemical modifications and structure/property/function. This project will allow us to tailor MOFs and control the materials properties. The student involved in this project will carry out MOFs synthesis; MOF chemical post modification; and MOF characterization; as well as study the properties of these materials.

31996,Electrosynthesis towards carbon-carbon bond formation and formation of new value-added chemicals,Electrosynthesis has been recently resurrected and successfully applied to several new chemical transformations. It is a greener alternative to a traditional chemical synthesis. Due to its many advantages; electrosynthesis is ideally suited for bond breaking and making. For example; this method can be used to break chemical bonds towards remediation of pollutants. In addition; this method allows for formation of new bonds; such as C-C bond formation between phenolic compounds. We have published on electrosynthesis and formation of C-C dimers from substituted phenols which are used in industrial applications. Hence; this project aims to evaluate how electrosynthesis may be used for chlorinated phenols; which have industrial implications and end up in the environment. The goal of the project is to use electrochemistry to dechlorinate such chemicals; and make new value-added chemicals. Ultimately; we aim to recycle and reuse chemicals which are already in use. The electrosynthesis will be carried and compared to traditional chemical synthesis. Specifically we aim to: a) compare reactivity of several structurally similar chlorophenols; b) evaluate effects of applied potential; electrolyte and solvent on reaction outcome and yield; and c) monitor reaction by spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The expectation is that chlorinated phenols will be dechlorinated and will form new C-C bonds to create larger dimers. Such new compounds may have enhanced properties such as fluorescence; which is of interest in material science. The expected outcomes of this project are to 1) determine how electrosynthesis compares to traditional chemical synthesis; and 2) identify the link between electrosynthesis parameters and reaction yield/ selectivity.

31999,Linear Infrastructure Impacted by Geohazards and Climate Change Effects,Climate change effects are shaping how we design; operate; and maintain linear infrastructure; such as roads; rail lines and culverts; and add an additional layer of complexity of how we manage these assets. Some of the key climate change effects include higher temperatures; change in season duration; more frequent and intense storms; and a warmer; rising ocean levels. The frequency; scale and intensity of climate change related hazards (e.g.; wildfires; flooding; geohazards) are expected to increase with more adverse outcomes. Higher temperatures may lead to reduced levels of service (e.g.; road surface rutting; rail line buckling); slope instability associated with the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires; and soil desiccation results in lower water absorption capacity and strength capacity. More intense and frequent storms exceed the existing capacity of water management systems that has resulted in catastrophic failure of embankments. Erratic variations in season duration and temperatures will; in some regions; increase the risk of frost/thaw cycling impairment of the road surface. From the Canadian perspective; due to polar amplification; the Artic regions are warmer at a much greater rate than the global average. Consequently; these northern regions have witnessed accelerated infrastructure deterioration; landscape transformations and disturbed ecosystems due to the adverse impact of climate change effects on permafrost (i.e.; ground that has been permanently frozen for more than one year) thaw. The geographic location (e.g.; urban; rural; coastal; inland) influences the nature and extent of the climate related hazards (e.g.; flooding; subsidence; slope stability) and frames the infrastructure exposure. There is a need to better understand the vulnerability of these assets to climate change effects by assessing both the infrastructure sensitivity (i.e.; degree to which infrastructure may be affected) and adaptive capacity (i.e.; ability to minimize adverse effects).,ShawnKenny,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,The student should be enrolled within a civil engineering program; where interests in climate change and geotechnical engineering are preferred.

32001,Topological Data Analysis,Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is currently a very active field of research; and much of the recent progress comes from studying so-called persistent modules. These are classical objects from topology (homology groups); which change when some of the parameters grow towards infinity. The topological features which "persist" over a longer range are considered important aspects of the data set; and this information can be used gain knowledge; also using techniques from machine learning. These methods have successfully been applied in a number of areas ranging from medicine to cybersecurity. However; the methods to compute and study persistent modules are computationally expensive; and a speed-up would be much needed: the current limit lies at around 1000 data points; which is too little for detailed image analysis. The aim of the research project is therefore to test and develop faster methods to perform these calculations involving persistent modules. For example; much of the current software relies on computing the range of large matrices; but they do not apply known methods from numerical analysis or stochastic methods to estimate this range. The first goal can be formulated in terms of linear algebra: given a sequence of matrices M_1 to M_n whose product is defined; find an efficient way to estimate the rank of the product M_1 ... M_n. More research is then needed to study similar questions for more complicated systems of matrices.,ThomasBrüstle,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-05-06,A good knowledge of linear algebra is required; as well as ability to implement and test new or existing methods on a computer.

32004,Aging in the Right Place Project,"Aging in the right place" involves supporting older adults to live as long as possible in their homes and communities; while recognizing that where an older person lives impacts their ability to age optimally and must match their unique lifestyles and vulnerabilities. "Promising practices" are innovative solutions that have not been subject to rigorous evaluation but hold the promise of supporting "aging in the right place”. Through a community-based participatory research approach; we will be using mixed-methods to evaluate promising practices across an inclusive housing continuum to determine "what works; why it works; and for whom it works." We will capture and evaluate the housing environment; staff of promising practice; support services; experience of older adults; and near-home neighbourhood environments to gauge well-being; aging in place; and housing satisfaction among a diverse group of older adults. Photovoice interviews will be conducted among the older adult participants encouraging the documentation of their perspectives through photography and storytelling. Our overall goal is to improve the shelter/housing options to meet the unique and complex health and social needs of diverse groups of older adults facing housing insecurity. To achieve this goal; our specific objectives are to: 1. Evaluate promising practices across the housing continuum that promotes aging in the right place to ultimately make recommendations for expanding a promising practice locally (scaling up) or enabling a promising practice to be adapted in other communities (scaling out). 2. Train a new generation of scholars to develop advanced research skills and lines of inquiry on housing insecurity; and aging research. 3.

32010,Speech perception and language acquisition in infancy: Behavioural and neural studies,Language is our most unique; and arguably most important; human capacity. It underlies all human achievements; from the establishment of civilization through current advances in health; education; science; and technology. At the crux of language’s utility is the link between form – in the case of spoken language; speech – and meaning. We at the Infant Studies Centre (Dr. Werker and her trainees) examine this interface as an essential entry into how language development begins in early infancy. We explore how infants’ initial speech perception sensitivities are shaped by experience to become reorganized into functional phonological categories; ultimately driving word learning. Put simply; we study the learning mechanisms and neural processes underlying language acquisition. Pertinent measurements include infants’ looking-time and/or looking-direction (e.g.; via eye-tracking) and brain activity (e.g.; via EEG or fNIRS); often collected simultaneously.

32017,Deep Convolutional Neural Network Mechanisms for Wind Prediction and Safe UAV Flights,Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is becoming prevalent and essential in a variety of indoor and outdoor applications; for instance; transportation; terrain mapping; reef monitoring; search and rescue; delivery of medical supplies; and others. As such; robust and accurate autonomous localization techniques for UAVs free from human intervention are in great demand. Unfortunately; many of the above-mentioned applications may encounter unreliable Global Positioning Systems (GPS) signal. In this case; low-cost units (e.g.; inertial measurement unit (IMU) and vision unit) might be the only source for positioning measurements. A challenge imposed by use of low-cost units is presence of significantActivities uncertainties. Therefore; smart localization systems able to provide accurate UAV motion components (i.e.; orientation; position; and linear velocity) are critically needed. This project proposes autonomous localization techniques for UAVs based on Kalman filters (e.g.; Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs)) tightly coupled with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) able to ensure accurate estimation of UAV motion components. Commonly; GPS provides position and linear velocity information of a travelling vehicle.

32018,UAVs Rendezvous and Docking using Reinforcement Learning,Rendezvous and docking are essential tasks in aerospace and robotics applications. Rendezvous and docking manoeuvres are critical for vehicle fueling and assembly. Successful completion of these two tasks requires robust algorithms able to perform three subtasks: target detection; guidance; and control. Through sustained efforts of the research community many challenges associated with the three aforementioned subtasks have been addressed. In this project; we plan to utilize existing successful detection and control techniques while contributing to the vehicle guidance subtask. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which can be employed to teach an agent toActivities perform a specific task based on experience. In this project; we will propose a model-based RL approach constructed using artificial neural network that by maximizing vehicle reward is able to successfully perform the desired action. This will be done by carefully selecting a reward which facilitates agent learning of complex tasks through experience. Since training an unmanned vehicle to successfully perform rendezvous and docking is unviable in a real-time scenario (potential destabilization); we plan to train the policy using data obtained from physical models. Next; we plan to train and test the policy on a simulated platform to emulate real-life scenarios. The simulated platform will incorporate measurement uncertainties and disturbances. This way; the developed policy will be robust against disturbances and sensor uncertainties.,HashimMohamed,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,- Good knowledge of control systems (linear control / automatic control) - Familiarity with the utilization/implementation of machine-learning/reinforcement-learning algorithms - Solid background in linear algebra and mathematical analysis - Good knowledge of simulation platforms (MATLAB Simulink) - Excellent programming skills (MATLAB; Python; etc.) - Self-motivation and ability to work independently,None

32021,UAV Perception based on Neural Networks Out-of-Distribution,Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are widely used for recognizing complex patterns and modeling nonlinear systems. ANNs have been successfully applied in various autonomous robotics applications (e.g.; autonomous cars and ground robots). However; trained ANNs may fail when faced with input data which is not well represented in the training set; commonly referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Algorithm failure can be detrimental for intolerant missions; including robotic applications. OOD data challenge is common for uninhabited aircrafts (drones) flying in low texture or foggy environments. Therefore; robust algorithms that can efficiently handle OOD data are of great importance mainly for safety reasons (e.g.; drone accidents). Majority of NNs utilize softmax normalization as a tool for confidence estimation. This approach can cause high confidence for OOD samples and consequently result in detection failure. To this end; two issues should be addressed: real-time computational cost and detection uncertainties. For computational cost reduction; this project proposes an OOD mechanism employing OOD samples Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based deep ANNs for sample identification. To address sample uncertainties; Monte Carlo (MC) dropout technique will be employed to measure uncertainties by applying dropout to ANN inference. The proposed mechanism will be validated using a publicly available real-world dataset.,HashimMohamed,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,- Basic knowledge of observer design and control systems - Good knowledge of linear algebra and mathematical analysis - Familiarity with the utilization/implementation of deep learning algorithms - Excellent programming skills (MATLAB; Python; etc.) - Self-motivation and ability to work independently,None

32025,Design and development of a lower limb exoskeleton for drop foot correction,This research project aims to develop a robotic exoskeleton for use by people with drop foot; a common symptom of neurological disease that results in weakened ankle dorsiflexion that can lead to the toe dragging on the ground during walking. Current treatment for drop foot includes the use of a passive ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) that provides support to the ankle through a rigid plastic device to hold the ankle in a neutral position during the swing phase of walking. There are several limitations to AFOs; primarily that they do not restore healthy biomechanics of the ankle but simply prevent excessive plantar flexion. In this project we aim to design a wearable robotic exoskeleton device that provides ankle dorsiflexion support through a variable stiffness mechanism. This project will be conducted in three phases: (1) literature review and prior art analysis; (2) design and development of the exoskeleton; and (3) clinical evaluation of the prototype. The Mitacs Globalink project will focus on the literature review; prior art analysis; and initial design stages. We will first review physiological behavior of the biological ankle through a literature review and research the pathological gait of drop foot. We will analyze existing passive AFOs and define the primary limitations. We will develop design requirements and corresponding technical specification for parameters such as device mass; function of actuators at ankle; required range of adjustable stiffness and damping properties; and battery life; and anthropomorphic shape and size. We will then implement parametric design models that take geometry; motor specifications; material selection; power source; maximum payload as inputs; and determine maximum stress on system; energy consumption; power output; device stiffness; and device mass as outputs.

32028,Quantum Topological Data Analysis,Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is currently a very active field of research; and much of the recent progress comes from studying so-called persistent modules. The topological features of the data which "persist" are considered important aspects of the data set; and this information can be used gain knowledge; also using techniques from machine learning. These methods have successfully been applied in a number of areas ranging from medicine to cybersecurity. However; the methods to compute and study persistent modules are computationally expensive; and a speed-up would be much needed. This is where quantum computers might provide an advantage. The first goal of the project is to study and experiment how one can use quantum computers to calculate the rank invariant of a persistent module; which constitutes one of the most important ways to measure a persistent module. There are quantum algorithms that estimate ranks of hermitian matrices; but they need to be modified in order to apply it in the TDA context.,ThomasBrüstle,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-04-30,A good knowledge of linear algebra is required; as well as ability to implement and test new or existing methods on a computer.

32029,Relativistic quantum computing,Quantum computing employs qubits instead of bits and quantum logic gates instead of Boolean logic to deliver quantum advantage to information processing. Mathematically; we can think of qubits as represented by tensor products of length-2 complex vectors and gates as even-dimensional unitary matrices acting on these vectors; and the mathematics is akin to spin-1/2 systems in the Schrödinger-Pauli equation. In contrast to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics where Pauli essentially hacked Schrödinger's equation to incorporate spin-1/2 systems; Dirac's relativistic quantum equation necessarily incorporates spin-1/2 particles and also their antimatter counterparts. The mathematics of Dirac's equation is beautiful. This project is about extending the mathematics of quantum computing from the Pauli algebra to the Dirac algebra. Specifically; we will explore generalising the Solovay-Kitaev theorem to the Dirac algebra using undergraduate linear-algebra matrix/vector methods and interpret the results as quantum circuits that would necessarily involve both qubits and anti-qubits. This investigation is totally new so we are in for some surprises. I doubt we will build quantum computers with anti-qubits but we will sure get some new insights into tractability and intractability for a new concept of quantum computing.,BarrySanders,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-04-30,Must have taken courses on quantum mechanics including solving Schrödinger's equation; linear algebra including eigenvectors and spectra; and a basic computer science course.

32030,Investigating the Consumption of Gut Metabolites by Crohn's Disease-Associated Escherichia coli,Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease driven by gut bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals. Adherent invasive strains of Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been recognized as CD risk factors due to their pro-inflammatory traits. By evolving AIEC in the host environment; we identified the pro-inflammatory adaptations acquired by these bacteria. We have shown that these strains can rapidly evolve to consume short chain fatty acids (SCFA) faster than their ancestor. Given their anti-inflammatory role in the gut; the utilization of SCFA by AIEC promotes inflammation. We have recently identified several mutations in an evolved AIEC isolate that rewired its metabolism. This led to a trade-off between the metabolism of SCFA and other carbon sources; allowing AIEC to consume these immunomodulatory molecules that are abundant in the gut. Using transcriptomics; we have identified several transporters that are upregulated in the evolved AIEC lineages; suggesting a potential role in importing SCFA. The objective of this project is to identify and characterize the SCFA transporters in AIEC. We will knockout the putative transporters and test the ability of the mutants to grow on SCFA; like acetate and propionate; as sole carbon source. We expect the AIEC mutant lacking the required transporter to display poor growth under these conditions. The putative SCFA transporter will be cloned and purified using affinity chromatography. Binding of the purified transporter to SCFA will be tested using isothermal titration calorimetry. In addition; we will measure SCFA transport activity in vitro using standard biochemical assays. These data will provide key mechanistic insights into the virulence of a CD-associated pathogen; uncovering novel targets for antimicrobial therapeutics.,WaelElhenawy,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-15,Theoretical background of bacterial genetics and general microbiology.

32035,The Sticky Defense: Exploring Spruce Oleoresin's Role in Combating Fungal Pathogens,Plants constantly face the threat of infection by pathogenic fungi; which can cause severe disease outbreaks; leading to significant mortality in agricultural crops and forest trees. Outbreaks greatly impact essential resources such as food supplies and timber commodities. However; plants can defend themselves by producing toxic chemicals that may halt infections or kill pathogens. The effectiveness of these defenses can determine whether devastating disease outbreaks occur and damage natural resources. Local and provincial economies in Western Canada are in part dependent on sustainable resources from spruce (Picea spp.) forests. However; spruce trees in this area are under attack by Leptographium abietinum; a fungal pathogen transmitted by the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis). This pathogen has affected millions of trees in the past five years. The fungus-beetle symbiosis enables the fungus to infect tree vascular tissue once the beetle has penetrated the bark of susceptible host trees. The fungus rapidly spreads in the tree phloem; resulting in severe disease and tree death within as little as two years. In response to these infections; spruce trees produce significant amounts of oleoresin—a sticky sap rich in fungitoxic chemicals. While oleoresin consists of various terpenes; diterpenes are the most common and possess antifungal properties. The effects of spruce diterpenes on L. abietinum is currently unknown. This student project will address this crucial knowledge gap in the battle to protect Canadian forest resources destructive pathogens. The student will conduct a laboratory experiment investigating how different concentrations of defense-related spruce diterpenes affect the growth and reproduction of L. abietinum. The project's findings will provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying spruce resistance to infection. Furthermore; these findings will lay the groundwork for future studies that identify biomarkers for rapidly screening L. abietinum- and spruce beetle-resistant spruce trees—helping to safeguard valuable forest resources from loss.,JonathanCale,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-06-03,The student should have completed microbiology and general chemistry courses; with proficiency in aseptic technique; culturing; basic use of a light microscope; and chemical solution preparation.

32046,Robotic Collision Management apply in virtual reality for haptic rendering,A common issue of robotic mechanisms is the possibility of collisions with human and other object. However; it is known that these collisions between humans; the environment or robot manipulator can be managed. The issue coming from a collision is the modification of workspace size and geometry of the reachable area of the manipulator. This variation within the control system can generate efforts that will no longer balanced by the force deployed in each motor axes. Indeed; the solution of an optimal force distribution in the axes that distributes the force applied to the manipulator cannot converge to a solution. Thus; this project aims to determine a solution that eliminates the constraint collisions. Our preferred solution is the control the plane described between two interfered rigid body in order to minimize the error between the predicted trajectory and the trajectory that doesn’t allow two bodies in contact to be deformed. Finally; this strategy is highlighted by a haptic application where a user moves the manipulator toward a collision; then trying to interact with a virtual surface.,MartinOtis,Québec,Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The candidate will design a new feedback loop in order to adjust the robot trajectory or the robot control law function of the collision plane.

32049,Design of Human-Robot Interaction using activities classification in the feedback loop,Human and Robot are usually not allowed to work together in the same workspace. When a human is found in the reachable workspace of the end-effector of the robot; it is usually stopped; which ends production. However; new industrial needs lead research to develop flexible and reactive chain production for enabling small quantity production or fast modification in product characteristics. Collaboration between human and robot sharing a common workspace (usually labelled as a hybrid work cell) could improve this flexibility. Nevertheless; human safety in human-robot interaction or collaboration is the main issue. This project aims to include our new sensors for human activities classification inside the motion control feedback of the robot in order to improve safety. The robot should know the current human activity in order to avoid collision (trajectory planning) or to change control parameters (such as damping) for physical interactions (pHRI).

32054,Transport phenomena in nanoporous materials,The scientific community faces several important and urgent challenges: how to mitigate the risk posed by traditional energy sector on climate change by increasing capture and storage of greenhouse gases? How to transition to new energy systems that are not carbon based? How to reduce and clean pollution fueled by population and economic growth? How to produce clean potable water that is becoming scarcer because of global warming? Materials with specifically tailored transport and reaction properties are needed to address every one of these challenges. For example; a variety of filtration systems have been developed to treat brackish water and supply freshwater to remote areas; as well as to remove oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions; enabling water recycling; environmental protection and land reclamation. Different types of polymer electrolyte membranes are synthesized to separate CO2 from post-combustion gas mixtures; for carbon capture and storage. The performance of low-temperature fuel cells and electrolysers depends on polymer electrolyte membranes to selectively conduct ions to steer the transport of ions; gas; water molecules; and promote key reactions. Despite a large variability of nanoporous structures used in these applications; they share basic requirements defining their function and operation: the transport behavior of ions and solvent; the selectivity to reject undesired species and suppress parasitic reactions; and the resistance to aging and failure. It remains a challenge for materials design and optimization to balance these requirements. To address this challenge; a holistic approach is required that targets the fundamental understanding of surface interactions; selective ion and solvent transport; and overall performance and lifetime. This project will host two students who will investigate transport phenomena in nanoporous materials using molecular dynamics simulation and mean-field (continuum) theories; respectively.,TianTang,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,Both students are expected to have completed courses in calculus; dynamics; fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.

32056,EEG markers of pain,Pain is a universal human experience and a fundamental driver of behaviour. However; its perception is subjective and highly influenced by multiple factors such as past experience; mood; and emotions. Unfortunately; the neural mechanisms giving rise to this subjective experience remain poorly understood; and our capacity to quantify pain from brain activity remains limited. This issue has led to calls for brain-based pain biomarkers; which would represent a valuable measurement tool for future research and provide crucial insights into how neural activity gives rise to the subjective pain percept. Many efforts have been dedicated to developing electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of pain since EEG systems have high relevance due to their wide availability; relatively low costs; ease of use; few contraindications; and high test-retest reliability. However; these attempts have been hindered by the use of small datasets and the use of univariate analyses ignoring the rich multivariate nature of electrical brain signals. The validity and reliability of previously published markers thus remain unclear. The overarching goal of this research project is to identify reliable; sensitive; specific; and interpretable predictive models capable of using brain activity to predict pain perception across individuals and pain experiences. During this project; the student will use a large database of EEG recordings in various states of pain and control conditions currently being collected in my lab; to develop; validate and interpret machine learning models of EEG data capable of predicting pain perception across participants and modalities. The identification of accurate predictive models will provide crucial scientific insights into how subjective pain perception is encoded in the brain and the general capacity of machine learning models to decode subjective experiences from brain activity.,Michel-PierreColl,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Students from all areas related to the project (psychology; neuroscience; machine learning; computer science; etc.) are welcome to apply.

32057,Walking into a Virtual World: A Pilot Randomized Trial using Virtual Reality and Omnidirectional Treadmill Training for People with Chronic Stroke,Cognitive function (thinking; memory; and concentration); balance; and walking problems affect the lives of many stroke survivors. Virtual reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment that can be explored in 360 degrees. VR has been introduced to the field of rehabilitation to promote improvements in cognitive function; walking ability; and balance. A new type of treadmill technology called an omnidirectional treadmill has emerged that allows for movement in all directions and is compatible with VR technology. The largest advantage of combining omnidirectional treadmill training with VR is to allow the user to challenge their walking and balance in a safe environment. Some previous research has indicated that VR may be more enjoyable and engaging for stroke survivors than traditional exercise. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether VR combined with omnidirectional treadmill training is enjoyable and feasible for stroke survivors who had a stroke more than 6 months previously and have problems with walking. Our secondary objectives are to estimate how much cognitive function; brain activation; walking ability; and balance change after 12 weeks of omnidirectional treadmill training with virtual reality in comparison with a traditional exercise program. We will recruit 30 participants from rehabilitation facilities; clinics; and stroke recovery clubs in Halifax; Nova Scotia. Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group will participate in VR on the omnidirectional treadmill 3 times per week for 45 minutes for 12 weeks total; while the control group will participate in a traditional exercise program consisting of strengthening and walking activities for the same amount of time. If successful; this affordable and accessible technology could be used to improve rehabilitation for stroke survivors and may change our understanding of how the brain works during real-world activities like walking and talking.,AdriaQuigley,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-01,Ideally this student will have a background in physiotherapy or a related field (occupational therapy; nursing; medicine) or they will have experience working with virtual reality or omnidirectional treadmill (or related) technology.

32059,Investigation of electrospun nanofibers for food packaging application,Effective distribution of fresh fruits and vegetables remains a complex challenge in many developing countries due to the lack of optimal preservation and packaging systems. One of the most pressing issues to be resolved is the proliferation of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms that can result in substantial product loss and pose health/safety concerns for the consumers; in addition to generating food waste that impacts the environment. One of the strategies to preserve fresh produce is to apply active packaging (AP) concept to enhance product stability in the distribution chain. AP systems typically consist of one or more active components capable of interacting with the product and/or ambient factors (humidity; temperature; oxygen); which in turn elicits an action beneficial to protect the product. For example; antimicrobial AP systems are capable of releasing antimicrobial volatile compounds; such as essential oils (EOs) from plants/herbs; into the package headspace and/or the food to increase the product shelf life. The efficacy of antimicrobial AP is determined by the stability of EO and its release rate; and therefore the EO must be encapsulated in an optimal polymeric carrier structure. Nonwovens prepared from electrospun fibers have large surface area and can be produced using non-thermal processes; making these materials an ideal substrate for AP applications. This project aims to explore electrospun nonwovens from naturally occurring biopolymers (proteins and polysaccharides) that are edible or biodegradable for the encapsulation of volatile antimicrobial for postharvest preservation of fresh fruits and vegetables. EO-laced antimicrobial electrospun nonwovens will be developed and characterized for their antifungal activity against typical spoilage microorganisms.

32076,Additive manufacturing of multifunctional composites and smart systems,Additive manufacturing; also known as 3D printing; has already proven its potential to manufacture small low-cost polymer composite parts; especially with the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) method. However; there is a high interest to manufacture high-performance industrial parts made of lighter; stiffer and stronger materials. One of the challenges is to 3D print components with desired geometries using a non-planar approach instead of a succession of planar layers to benefit from the anisotropic behavior of FFF. Another challenge is to 3D print large parts (~1m × ~1m) and especially using high-performance polymers and composites. The Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics (LM2) at Polytechnique Montreal has recently developed a 6-axis robotic platform with a custom-made FFF printing system with a non-planar toolpath generator. However; we have not yet mechanically characterized some 3D printed samples comparing the benefits of non-planar additive manufacturing at high volumetric flowrates for large components. The challenge is now to succeed in printing and characterizing such components. The aim of the internship(s) is to improve the mechanical performance of the FFF 3D printing process by 3D printing and characterizing non-planar geometries. The outcomes of this project will help to improve the fabrication of large 3D printed parts for aerospace applications.,DanielTherriault,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-13,Hands-on attitude; Familiar with additive manufacturing and polymer composites; Familiar with materials mechanical testing and characterization,None
32077,Lightweight structural materials for automotive and aerospace applications,The automotive and aerospace industry is facing a significant challenge in reducing the weight of vehicles to improve fuel economy and reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions without compromising safety and reliability. The reduction of vehicle weight can be best achieved via combining the use of lightweight materials with innovative manufacturing and structural design. Lightweight structural materials include magnesium alloys; aluminum alloys and titanium alloys; as well as aluminum- or titanium-containing novel high-entropy alloys. The application of these alloys inevitably involves welding; which is one of key joining techniques in manufacturing critical engineering components in the automotive and aerospace industry. Ultrasonic spot welding and friction stir welding; being promising solid-state joining techniques; have been referred to as “green” technology by some researchers due to their energy efficiency and environment friendliness. They are enabling technology for joining lightweight magnesium and aluminum alloys which were classified as unweldable by traditional fusion welding. They are thus considered by many researchers to be the most significant development in the area of materials joining. The objective of this project is to identify the relationships among the welding parameters; microstructures; and mechanical properties of ultrasonic spot welded and friction stir welded magnesium alloys; so as to promote the applications of the solid-state joining technology and lightweight alloys in Canadian manufacturing industry.,DaolunChen,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,Enthusiasm required.

32078,Design of a low-power edge computing circuit for an AI-driven fall descent algorithm,In North America; more than 330;000 seniors per year suffer a hip fracture; the most common injury in this segment of the population. In fact; one-third will suffer a fall and the impact of these falls accounts for more than 95% of fractures. Once a hip fracture occurs; 20% die within a year. In order to prevent hip fractures; we developed an intelligent wearable garment that detects a fall before impact and deploys an airbag that uses an AI driven fall descent algorithm that need to be embedded.

32079,Verticillium longisporum, a new threat to canola in Canada,Verticillium Stripe disease caused by Verticillium longisporum was firstly identified in canola field from Manitoba in 2015 and now has spread to most of the canola production area in Canada including Alberta; Saskatchewan; and Ontario. Verticillium longisporum has three lineages A1/D1; A1/D2; and A1/D3; and previous studies demonstrated that they exhibited different pathogenicity Brassica species. Unfortunately; we found all three V. longisporum lineages in canola fields across Canada; and Vl A1/D1 was the predominant strain. Canola is the most important cash crop in Canada; and it will be noteworthy to understand the pathogenicity variations on canola plant; particularly on both susceptible and resistant canola varieties. In this project; we will inoculate three Vl isolates from lineages A1/D1; A1/D2; and A1/D3 onto both Westar (a susceptible canola variety); and Quinta (a resistance canola variety). Root-dipping method will be used for disease inoculation. Briefly; 4 week old seedlings will be pulled out from the soil; and washed under tap water. Then we will cut the root tips and dip roots into prepared V. longisporum inoculum. The three V. longisporum isolates were recovered from filed collection and cultured in PDA plate. At maturity stage; the disease severity will be assessed through a widely used rating system from score 0-4 by infection size; presence of microsclerotia; and other disease symptoms. Infected plant tissues will be sampled for DNA and RNA extraction for gene expression analysis. We will investigate the expression of plant defense related genes by quantification real-time PCR; such as PR1; PDF1.2; PR2; PR5; PR4; MYC2; etc; participated salicylic and jasmonic acid signal pathways. The main objectives of this study are 1) the pathogenicity difference between three different V. longisporum lineages on susceptible and resistant canola; 2) how canola plant defense related genes respond to V. longisporum infection.,ZhongweiZou,Ontario,Wilfrid Laurier University,English,2024-05-01,Students from agricultural science; plant science; crop science; and biological science are a good fit for the project.

32080,Development of an intelligent conversational agent to support patients living with HIV: MARVIN,After 40 years of the HIV pandemic; there is still no cure or vaccine; but effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV). However; to this day; PLHIVs still require lifelong monitoring; self-management; and adherence to treatment to maintain an undetectable HIV viral load and thus avoid complications and transmission of the virus. Self-management is essential for longevity and health-related quality of life. Mobile health (mHealth); the use of mobile devices (e.g.; smartphones) for health practices and self-care; offers promising solutions for empowering users and giving patients greater control over their health management. One of the most promising avenues for mHealth is the emergence of Chatbots; which have proven to be an acceptable medium for the general public. Chatbots in general act as virtual assistants that talk to users; using advanced artificial intelligence methods to understand their requests and respond appropriately. In 2020; my research team at Polytechnique Montreal; in collaboration with the McGill University Health Centre; developed a first version of a Chatbot called MARVIN that supports PLHIVs by answering basic ART-related questions to help PLHIVs improve treatment adherence. Because PLHIVs have limited contact with caregivers; much of the time and effort required for HIV management and associated behavior change is borne daily by patients and their informal caregivers. By talking to an on-call Chatbot; PLHIVs can obtain the information they need for self-management.,SofianeAchiche,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Experience in computer programming and artificial intelligence.

32081,Machine-Learning Accelerated Structural Optimization,Topology Optimization (TO) of mechanical structure is a numerical tool used by structural conception engineering teams in numerous industries; notably in the aerospace and automobile industries. This tool aims to optimize the material distribution inside a given volume with the objective to maximize the mechanical performance of the structure while minimizing the mass. Although showing enormous potential in sustainable design and manufacturing; current topological optimization methods are very expensive in terms of computational and engineering validation; which limits their widespread use in industry.

32082,Development of an artificial intelligence informed E-health behaviour change platform,It has been shown that poor health behaviours; e.g.; physical inactivity; poor diet; smoking; account for approximately 80% of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). Achieving and maintaining longterm health behaviour change is a complex process; but at its core is knowledge of what behaviours to engage in; greater intrinsic motivation to engage in them; and increased self-efficacy in one’s ability to maintain change. Motivational communication (MC) is an evidence-based; patient-centred communication style designed to be used as an adjunct to established behaviour change interventions. For MC to be effective in face-to-face interventions; it is important to use non-verbal cues; e.g.; facial expressions and tone of response; to evaluate the discordance between an individual’s desire vs. barriers to change a behaviour. Recent advances in the processing of multimodal emotion data using complex nonlinear interactions; e.g.; deep learning architectures; convolutional neural networks; adaptive multiple classifier systems; and partially supervised learning; provides a potential opportunity to translate MC into an eHealth solution. However; the majority of the work on multimodal emotion recognition has been developed using contrived scenarios with actors and not using real-world populations. As such; the integration of these kinds of algorithms into a service-oriented architecture that may also be commercially viable; and that also provides an effective behaviour change solution; is a notable challenge. In the current application; we will capture video and voice responses to specific questions around an individual’s progress with achieving their behaviour change goals from individuals participating in a previously developed eHealth behaviour change platform. Data will be captured through handheld device videos and will occur throughout the program. This will allow us the capacity to adapt and enhance the inter- and intra-person algorithms using multimodal data.,SimonBacon,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-20,Students with either an engineering/computer science or behaviour change background are required for this project.

32083,Quantum Raychaudhuri Equation, Singularities and the Quantum Origin of Lambda,Classical gravity (general relativity) suffers from spacetime singularities; as predicted by the Raychaudhuri equation and the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems. The quantum Raychaudhuri equation (QRE) provides one way to remove the singularities by replacing classical geodesics with quantal trajectories. The QRE also predicts the corrected Friedmann equation in cosmology; with the correction term dependent on the wavefunction of the perfect fluid filling the Universe. Postulating that this fluid is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of light bosons; one can show that the correction term can give rise to a cosmological constant of the observed value; for a suitable choice of the wavefunction. The project will critically study the mathematical and physical aspects of the above equations; including their action formulation and matching their predictions with available cosmological data.

32086,Gravity as an emergent phenomenon: new developments,Quantum mechanics and general relativity are two of the most successful physical theories. Yet they are apparently incompatible; and despite several attempts; a successful quantum theory of the gravitational field is yet to be formulated. An alternative approach is to consider gravity not as a fundamental interaction; but one derived from an underlying; possibly quantum theory. Recently we made progress in this idea and showed that indeed gravity and for that matter any observable interaction can be derived as the `quantum potential' of a suitable underlying wavefunction [1;2]. In this project; we will study this idea further; embed our theory in a fully covariant framework; compute corrections to the well known gravitational potentials and other measurable predictions.

32087,An alternative to Dark Matter,The Universe apparently contains more matter than is visible or detectable by direct experiments. This is because the observable effects of gravity at astrophysical and cosmological scales appear stronger than that provided by visible matter. The missing 25% of matter in the Universe is known as Dark Matter. However; it is possible that visible matter simply exerts a stronger gravitational force than predicted by the standard theory (Newtonian or relativistic); which matches all observations; and that there is no need for dark matter. We recently showed that the Newtonian gravitational potential; augmented by a logarithmic term; can precisely provide this extra gravity to explain observations at the various length scales [1;2]. In this project; we will examine the origin of such a potential; ways to embed it in a covariant theory; and its theoretical and observational implications. Reference: [1] S. Das; S.

32088,On the superluminal propagation of signals,The theory of relativity stipulates that the maximum speed of propagation of any signal is c; the speed of light in vacuum. Yet; there have been many attempts to construct theoretical models in which signal propagation can exceed this speed. One common requirement in these models is that the systems under question must be quantum in nature. We will examine these models; the criticisms thereof; and potential ways of addressing those concerns to construct a viable model for superluminal signal propagation. We will study potential ways of testing this proposal and its its implications.,SauryaDas,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,The student should know quantum mechanics.

32089,Intent-Negotiation Framework for Autonomous Network and Cloud Service Management,To automate network operations and deployment of compute services; intent-driven service management (IDSM) is essential. It enables the network and compute service users to express their service requirements in a declarative manner as intents. To fulfill the intents; closed control-loop operations carry out required configurations and deployments without human intervention. Despite the fact that intents are fulfilled automatically; conflicts may arise between user’s and service provider’s intents due to limited resources availability. This triggers IDSM system to initialize an intent negotiation process among conflicting actors. Intent negotiation involves generating one or more alternate intents based on the current state of the underlying physical/virtual resources; which are then presented to the intent creator for acceptance or rejection. In this way; the quality of services (QoS) can be improved significantly by maximizing the acceptance rate of service requests in the scenario of limited resources. However; the concept of intent negotiation in IDSM is still in its infancy. The available solutions are platform dependent which poses various challenges in their adoption to diverse platforms. Such that the intent-negotiation solution developed for OpenStack can not be adopted for Kubernetes and vice versa. Hence; the main objective of this project is to design a comprehensive and generic intent negotiation framework which can be used to develop intent negotiation solutions for diverse hierarchical and multi-domain IDSM platforms.,YogeshSharma,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,A student must have a background in computer science; computer engineering or information technology.

32090,Perturbative quantum gravity: new insights,Quantum mechanics and general relativity are two of the most successful physical theories. Yet they are apparently incompatible; and despite several important approaches; a successful quantum theory of the gravitational field is yet to be formulated.

32092,Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) Communications,High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) systems are communication platforms located at 20 Km from the ground. In areas where terrestrial and satellite networks tend to fail; HAPS can serve as a cellular connectivity service provider; a data center-like computing power provider; and an aerial data storage component. In spite of the HAPS’s high altitude; direct communication between the HAPS and ground users (Downlink) can be guaranteed efficient through the use of sophisticated antenna designs; such as massive MIMO and high-throughput bandwidths like millimeter wave. However; communication from users to HAPS (Uplink) is minimal due to the low transmit power of user devices; which may prevent the HAPS paradigm from offering novel applications requiring high uplink throughput; such as virtual/augmented reality. To tackle this issue; we propose in this project to enable transmissions through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) installed within the vicinity of users. The RIS is a novel paradigm suggesting manipulating the radio frequency (RF) signals and reflecting them in a controlled manner in order to improve the quality of communications. The reduced cost; low power use; lightweight; and flexible deployment of RIS make it an attractive candidate for integration within HAPS systems. Consequently; in this project; we propose investigating the use of RIS for HAPS uplink transmissions. The objective is to provide optimized transmit power control; RIS locations; and phase-shift configurations; aiming to maximize users' transmissions' uplink weighted sum rate. The joint optimization of these parameters will be conducted through novel optimization and/or machine learning-based methods.,WaelJaafar,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-05-06,- Familiar with the utilization/implementation of algorithms - Excellent programming skills (Matlab; Python; etc.) - Understand wireless communication fundamentals - Familiar with operational research (e.g.; problem formulation and solving) - Good mathematical analysis background - Self-motivated and autonomous working,None

32099,Testing Deep Learning Libraries,Deep Learning (DL) techniques are widely applied to solve important real-world problems; such as image and voice recognition; and autonomous driving cars. Due to the complexity and wide application of DL techniques; practitioners build DL libraries to make DL algorithms more accessible to application developers. Modern DL applications largely depend on popular DL libraries; e.g.; TensorFlow; PyTorch; Theano and Keras. The quality assurance of DL libraries is critical as it affects millions of applications that are built on top of them. However; there has been little attention to study the quality assurance activities in DL libraries (i.e.; the test suites by DL libraries’ developers). Such test cases guarantee the correctness of the implementations in DL libraries. Insufficient or low-quality test suites affects the quality of DL libraries. Furthermore; the generated models from DL libraries can be problematic as well. DL libraries; especially the core algorithm module; heavily encode mathematical formulas and arithmetic operations. The corresponding test suites of DL libraries have unique characteristics; which are not studied by prior studies on software quality-assurance activities. To better guarantee the quality of DL libraries which are the backbones of modern DL applications; my students and I will perform studies to understand the unique challenges in the current test practices in DL libraries; and propose novel automated solutions to overcome the discovered challenges. For instance; improving the coverage of test suites in DL libraries may better guarantee the quality; however; the traditional coverage metrics may be less relevant in the context of DL libraries. Another example from the perspective of test execution is that the prevalence of test flakiness should be examined in DL libraries. New techniques should be developed to assist developers in maintaining testing practices and detect test flakiness.,JinqiuYang,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-31,I am looking for students who are self-motivated and eager to learn in the domain of Software Engineering and Machine Learning.

32108,Digital workflows for Adaptive Reuse of Historic Buildings,Carleton is one of the 14 universities involved in the SSHRC: Quality in the Built Environment partnership; with a research team; made up of graduate students and professors across the Azrieli School of Architecture and Urbanism and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Carleton’s research site explores the topic of Adaptive Reuse for a Sustainable Future; which looks at: the prevalence; impacts of; and barriers to the adaptive reuse of existing and historic buildings; definitions and methodologies of assessing quality in adaptive reuse; and potential synergies between adaptive reuse and wider social and environmental goals. Adaptive reuse is becoming an increasingly valuable tool as we observe the upsurge in vacant and underutilized buildings across multiple building typologies such as office buildings; sacred buildings and industrial buildings. Paired with a culture of “throw-away;” our built environment is subject to cycles of demolition and new construction; resulting in significant environmental impacts alongside the loss of character and social cohesion of neighborhoods. Carleton’s research seeks to determine the potential benefits of building reuse over new construction and assesses how to achieve them through quality design. In other words; how can existing buildings be adapted to new typologies while sustaining socio-cultural and economic relevance and heritage values and avoiding the waste of vast amounts of materials and embodied energy.,MarioSantana Quintero,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-06,Preferably and architectural or civil engineering student with good digital skills; such as Computer-Aided Drawing (CAD); Building Information Modeling; and Image processing (e.g. photoshop).

32109,Resolving Time Travel Paradoxes,In general relativity; there are some spacetime geometries which seem to allow time travel. If these geometries are realistic; and time travel is possible; then it will lead to consistency paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox. In this project; we will attempt to resolve time travel paradoxes using either the Novikov conjecture; the multiple-history approach; or something completely different. Specifically with regards to the multiple-history approach; we may work on providing a physical mechanism for the creation of additional histories when time travel occurs; or a mathematical model for a spacetime that can accommodate multiple histories.,BarakShoshany,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have good knowledge of differential geometry and general relativity; or at least have good knowledge of the relevant background from mathematics and physics and be willing to spend a few months studying differential geometry and general relativity from a textbook before the project starts.

32110,The Relation Between Time Travel And Faster-Than-Light Travel,In general relativity; there are some spacetime geometries which seem to allow time travel and/or faster-than-light travel. It is well-known that time travel and FTL travel are related; in that having access to one may allow you to do the other. However; it is not known to what extent; exactly; this relation applies. In particular; does having access to FTL travel *always* allow you to travel back in time? If so; how far in time can you travel; and how is that related to the maximum FTL speed you can attain? If not; then what are the exact conditions that allow time travel? In this project; we will attempt to answer some or all of these questions.,BarakShoshany,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have good knowledge of differential geometry and general relativity; or at least have good knowledge of the relevant background from mathematics and physics and be willing to spend a few months studying differential geometry and general relativity from a textbook before the project starts.

32111,Faster-Than-Light Travel In General Relativity,In general relativity; there are some spacetime geometries which seem to allow faster-than-light travel. However; these geometries generally require matter with negative energy to create them; and such matter does not appear to exist in our universe (except in small quantities due to quantum effects). In this project; we will attempt to find a realistic spacetime geometry which will allow FTL travel; but without requiring negative energy. This could be done either by modifying existing geometries; or by creating a whole new geometry of our own.,BarakShoshany,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-05-01,The student must have good knowledge of differential geometry and general relativity; or at least have good knowledge of the relevant background from mathematics and physics and be willing to spend a few months studying differential geometry and general relativity from a textbook before the project starts.

32115,Automated Detection and Visualization of Anti-Social Behaviour in Social Media,Online anti-social behaviour; commonly manifesting as cyberbullying and trolling; has been present since the early days of the Internet; but with the advent of social media; the number of people exposed to it has risen exponentially. Thus; the long-term objective of this work is to: Develop computational models to measure the hostility level and overall ‘social health’ of online groups and platforms. Such models can then be integrated with existing social networking platforms to empower moderators with the next generation administrative tools that would provide real time insights about the ‘health’ of an online community and predict its future lifecycle and viability. It would allow moderators to see what topics and what users (or group of users) are more likely to support hostile discussions; engage in trolling or cyberbullying; and take appropriate and targeted measures without necessarily blocking the whole discussion board or moderating individual messages. Related to this proposal; the short-term objective is to develop and validate detection models to identify troll- and bully-type accounts on four major social media platforms: Twitter; Facebook; reddit; and YouTube. In particular; we will examine politically-motivated discussions on topics such as climate change; elections; vaccination; refugees; and race which are known to attract a higher than usual amount of verbal abuse; attacks and harassment. The expected outcome will be three-fold: (1) computational models and an open-source library to detect instances and accounts that exhibit anti-social behaviour; (2) a generalized topology of anti-social behaviours; and (3) a set of datasets representing the ground truth that can be used by other researchers.,AnatoliyGruzd,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-20,Applicants are expected to have strong technical; research and communication skills; a passion for data analysis and demonstrable expertise in web development and programming using languages such as Python and R.

32116,Synthetic biology : using metabolic engineering for the production of valuable plant molecules./ Biologie synthétique : utilisation de l’ingénierie métabolique pour la production de molécules végétales de valeur.,Alkaloids constitute a diverse class of natural products and due to their potent biological activity; many are commercially exploited. Most alkaloids are derived from amino acids and characterized by a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. Recently; the alkaloids produced by Amaryllidaceae plants (e.g. Narcissus (daffodils) and Galanthus (snowdrops)) have been attracting increasing interest due to their multiple biological activities. For example; Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids (AAs) such as lycorine act as pesticides; haemanthamine and narciclasine possess anti-cancer properties whereas galanthamine is used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The commercial development of AAs is restricted to limited availability due to low amount in planta (only galanthamine is produced commercially). Although there are obvious interests in engineering AA production; for crop improvement or development of pharmaceuticals; the lack of information on AA regulation and biosynthetic pathways make this task very challenging; no biosynthetic genes have been identified yet. An improved molecular understanding of AA biosynthesis will contribute to engineered plants with valuable AA profiles and pave the way for biotechnologies such as synthetic biology to improve production and availability. The overall aim of the proposed research is to increase knowledge on the metabolism and regulation of AAs in plants; with special reference to the establishment of ‘omic’ databases to facilitate discovery of novel genes involved in AA biosynthesis in Amaryllidaceae. It should be noted that the project could relate to another type of molecules (cannabinoids; phenolics; etc.) with the same objectives due to the research funding obtained.,IsabelDesgagné-Penix,Québec,Université du Québec à Trois–Rivières,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Knowledge of DNA cloning; molecular biology and biochemistry techniques.

Au cours des 20 dernières années de nouvelles gammes de bétons plus durables ont été mis au point; en particulier les bétons fibrés à haute et ultra-haute performances. Ces bétons sont plus durables car ils contiennent de petites fibres métalliques ou synthétiques qui permettent de renforcer le béton et de limiter l'ouverture des fissures en conditions de service.

32120,Medical diagnosis with thermal image processing,The nervous system in the skin controls the flow of blood and the thermal emission of the skin. They can be captured using the thermal camera. At normal temperature; the human body acts as a perfect transmitter of infrared radiation; these radiations emanating from the tissue can be captured by thermal imaging cameras. Infrared thermography (IRT) in the field of medicine is a non-intrusive and radiation-free technology to monitor the physiological functions of skin temperature control. The effectiveness; safety and low cost of IRT make it a useful auxiliary tool for detecting and locating thermal abnormalities characterized by increases or decreases in the surface temperature of the skin. These thermal abnormalities can be used to find the type and extent of injuries in athletes In sports medicine; IRT can be used to identify risk factors and prevent future injuries during training and during competition. It can also be used to stop Injuries from excessive wear. It can also be used to detect any disruption of the normal symmetry of any part of the body and help to find the body's response for treatment. Sports players are often required to play matches continuously in a season; this continuous stress will lead to the muscle fatigue in the players. The Players need to have sufficient rest for the muscles to recover from the fatigue. If the players are not given enough rest the fatigue will lead to injuries. The main aim of the project is to track the muscle fatigue by taking the muscle temperature using thermal imaging and help the management in maintaining the fatigue and avoid muscle injuries due to extreme fatigue.,AhmedLakhssassi,Québec,Université du Québec en Outaouais,English,2024-05-06,The objectives of the Projects are • Perform feature extraction from the thermal images/ videos. • Find the hottest spot of the body or a specific Region of Interest. • Compare the Region of interest with the player’s previous thermal images. • Build the patient thermographic profile of the player during his training and playing matches.

32122,Monitoring and modelling of sediment transport in combined sewer systems under intensive rain events,In the project the combined sewer system of the City of Québec is being studied by the modelEAU research team to collect large data sets about the sediments as they move from the source (e.g. households and roads) to the wastewater treatment plant. Sediments are mobilized by the wastewater flow; with increased mobilization under higher flows thanks to increased shear stress. Under intense rain events the transport is extremely high leading to the so-called first flush. More importantly; under storm events the hydraulic capacity of the sewer system is exceeded and direct discharge of untreated wastewater in the river is the result; impacting water quality severely. Extensive experimental work will be conducted to (i) characterize the sediments using a novel experimental method that provides a distribution of settling velocities and (ii) to use automated measurement stations with turbidity sensors to quantify the transport of particles with the water flow. Mathematical models of the transport process will be developed within the WEST urban wastewater simulator (mikebydhi.com) and it will be tried to fit the newly developed models to the collected data.,PeterVanrolleghem,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,The student should have some background regarding sewer systems and wastewater quality; and have some laboratory experience.

32124,Improving the performance of the Advanced LIGO detectors,Gravitational-wave (GW) detector data; including the LIGO detectors; often contains a high rate of instrumental artifacts that can mask or mimic true astrophysical GW signals. This project will characterize noise sources in the Advanced LIGO detectors with the goal of reducing the number of 'false alarm' GW candidates and improving the reach of GW searches for the next observing run; which will be still underway in Summer 2024. Student researchers will apply current data analysis techniques to identify and investigate the sources of transient noise sources in LIGO data; with the goal of directing commissioners at the LIGO sites to fix identified instrument issues; or mitigate the impact of characterized noise with data post-processing.

32126,Techno-economic analysis of combined concentrating photovoltaic solar and compressed thermal energy storage systems,Solar energy is a widely available resource with the potential to meet a significant portion of the world's energy demand. To make it cost competitive with other sources of energy; novel approaches to harnessing and using solar energy are required. Moreover; solar energy is intermittent; available when the sun is out and not available during cloudy days and at night. As such a means of storing energy for late use becomes critical to extend the usage time of solar energy. In this project; combined high temperature photovoltaic thermal systems (PVT) will be developed; modelled and optimized. The thermal energy from the thermal side of the system will be upgraded; stored and used in an Organic Rankine cycle for power generation.

32127,Creation of endogenously-tagged cell lines by CRISPR-Cas9 to assess protein localization,Each intracellular compartment in a eukaryotic cell has a unique protein composition. The proteins are generally synthesized on ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported to and through the Golgi. This is accomplished by the formation of transport vesicles at each compartment that must be properly recognized by the correct acceptor compartment. This requires many factors including so-called vesicle tethering factors. Defects in correctly targeting these vesicles have been linked to numerous human disorders. In the early secretory pathway; material is transported between the ER and Golgi and the tethering factor implicated in this process is called TRAPP. In yeast; this complex is composed of 11 subunits that are distributed in 3 complexes. In humans; there are 13 subunits found in 2 distinct complexes. A number of the mammalian-specific proteins; including C11; have been implicated in human health. Understanding the functions of these proteins is an active area of research in my laboratory. In order to better understand the function of these proteins and the entire complex; we must better understand the cellular consequences upon depleting the cells of the proteins. In the past; we have used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate knockouts of non-essential TRAPP genes. However; the gene encoding C11 is essential; thus making a knockout impossible. Although we have obtained fibroblasts from individuals with C11 variants; generating these variants in different types of cells will allow us to better study the consequences of the specific genetic changes. Thus; the applicant will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce patient-identified C11 variants into cells by homolgy-directed repair.,MichaelSacher,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-05-06,The applicant must have a strong theoretical background in molecular biology and basic cloning procedures including the use of restriction enzymes; ligations and PCR.

32128,Horizontal Gene Transfers in Early-diverging Fungi,Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is a process in which organisms acquire foreign genes from different species. HGT contributes to organismal evolution and has been an important source of genetic diversity. HGT was commonly identified in prokaryotes but rarely reported in eukaryotes. However; our understanding of HGT in eukaryotes is quickly expanding with the production of genomic resources and the development of detection tools. The Kingdom Fungi represent a striking example; especially the ones known as obligate symbionts which interact with various host organisms intimately. Our research group has dedicated to detecting fungus-related HGT elements and has discovered several such cases in early-diverging groups including the mosquito gut-dwelling fungi (doi:10.1093/molbev/msw126); herbivorous mammal rumen fungi (doi:10.1128/mSystems.00247-19); amphibian gastrointestinal fungi (doi:10.1534/g3.120.401516); and photobionts associated fungi (doi:10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.058). This project aims to identify novel HGT using lab newly assembled fungal genomes representing underexplored lineages on the Tree of Life. The student working on this project will help refine lab existing pipelines and analyze the fungal genomes as well as related host data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of identified genes by conducting comparative genomics.

32129,Computational Studies of Modified Nucleic Acid Aptamers and Drugs,Nucleic acids are valuable therapeutics; which can take the form of nucleotides; aptamers or siRNA. The use of nucleic acids permits targeting even currently undruggable since proteins and opens the door for treating a wider array of diseases. Currently; several FDA approved modified nucleic acid therapies exist; with the number in clinical trials rapidly expanding. One challenge in rational drug design is the poor pharmacological properties (immunogenicity; degradation; poor cellular uptake) of unmodified DNA/RNA. Therefore; existing nucleic acid therapies rely on chemical modifications. However; since the number of chemical modifications and positions make the combinatorial space intractably large for most drug designs; experimental studies are restricted to a few modifications chosen based on preliminary hypotheses and extrapolative assumptions. As a result; the structural and stability impact of single and multiple modifications on the nucleic acids is lacking. The proposed work will use molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to systematically consider the impact of single and multiple modification schemes for a range of chemical substituents in different nucleic acid structural motifs. This will provide the much-needed atomic level information required to understand the structure and function of existing and new nucleic acid therapeutics; with the goal to identify novel modifications that will enhance drug performance.,StaceyWetmore,Alberta,University of Lethbridge,English,2024-05-01,,None

32132,Investigation of respiratory neuronal networks involved in the control of respiration,Breathing in mammals is most fragile during sleep; in particular during REM sleep. Data from our laboratory suggest that expiratory activity may be critical in both neonatal and adult period to promote respiratory pacing and provide an additional drive to weak inspiration; in order to prevent breathing irregularities and strengthen inspiratory activity. The objective of the this project is to investigate neuronal structures that control the activity of the brainstem netwrok oscillators that control breathing. By means of a combination of pharmacology; optogenetics and chemogenetics; we will identify neuromodulatory inputs; and manipulate their function in order to determine the role of respiratory neruons in control conditions and in rodent models of sleep disordered breathing. The student will be responsible for the surgical procedures in rodents; acquisition of data; data analysis; and elaboration of the results. The student will aquire expertise in survival surgeries; stereotaxic injection; animal handling; EEG/EMG instrumentation; and optogenetic techniques. She/He will also gain experience on data analysis of EEG and respiratory variables in anesthetized rodents.,SilviaPagliardini,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,- Solid knowledge of general neuroscience; neurophysiology and respiratory physiology - Previous experience with animal handling; and possibly; with surgical procedures in rodents is preferred.,None
32133,Cannabinoids effects on sleep and breathing,Although a multitude of undocumented evidence suggests that marijuana (cannabis) promotes relaxation and sleep; there is a lack of systematic scientific studies showing this to be the case. Medically; cannabis may provide fundamental health benefits if it can promote the full spectrum of sleep and also if it has beneficial effects on breathing during sleep (unlike opioids). The purpose of this project is to systematically explore the effects of cannabis principal components on sleep dynamics and breathing in rodents in order to evaluate its potential therapeutic benefits and/or harms. In this way; we can explore how acute and chronic cannabis (or its components) use may impact both sleep and respiratory functions through development and in adulthood. We will use animal models of both sexes to strengthen the evidence base for this targeted approach and build pre-clinical scientific and health related knowledge for future development of a much needed treatment for both sleep and sleep disordered breathing.,SilviaPagliardini,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,background in neuroscience; neuro-physiology; pharmacology and respiratory physiology,None
32134,Sex hormone effects on ventilation,Progesterone (a female sex hormone) has been implicated in the potentiation of breathing during pregnancy and during specific phases of the menstrual cycle in women. Additionally; the reduction in circulating progesterone levels in women is proposed to be a main contributing factor to the increased frequency of sleep disordered breathing following menopause. In this project we will investigate the mechanisms underlying sex-hormone induced ventilatory recovery in a model of central hypoventilation; a condition in which an impaired response to respiratory challenges (high CO2 or low O2 levels of inspired air) occurs because of altered development and/or function of a key area of the brain (the retrotrapezoid nucleus) that senses changes in CO2 and pH levels. We will use a rodent model to generate a impairment in CO2 detection and we will provide a long-term treatment with a synthetic progestinic hormone; (Etonogestrel) that has been previously proposed to induce partial recovery of respiratory function in congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS) patients . We will test recovery of respiratory function in this model and will analyze brain tissue to assess the areas in the brain that are responsible for this recovery and the cellular and molecular changes associated with the hormonal treatment. We will also investigate the function of the gene affected in CCHS (i.e.; PHOX2B): we will reduce expression of the naive protein and we will ectopically express the mutated PHOX2B protein in the retrotrapezoid nucleus. We will assess changes in respiratory function and in gene and protein expression caused by these manipulations. Results from our experiments will explore some important aspects of the mechanism of action of sex hormones that promote chemoreflex recovery; and will contribute to reveal key molecular mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of CCHS and other central hypoventilation syndromes.,SilviaPagliardini,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,knowledge in neuroscience; respiratory physiology; pharmacology,None
32135,Recent Advances in Operations Management,Supply chains are a vital part of the Canadian economy; and they consist of an array of industries such as production; distribution; transportation; international trade and retail. Matching supply and demand is challenging due to the scale; complexity and constantly changing nature of a supply chain. Supply chain decisions often require information visibility across functional areas and affect multiple stakeholders. However; supply-side and demand-side decisions are frequently made in silos. The research goal is to improve the overall performance of supply chains. While we are interested in reducing cost on the supply side and increasing revenue on the demand side; we will focus on maximizing profit through the joint control of supply and demand and assessing the benefit of joint control.

32138,RNAi based nanotherpaies for cardiovascular diseases,Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in westernized countries. This burden is caused primarily by atherosclerosis; a systemic disease characterized by chronic inflammation of arterial walls with lumen lipid deposits (plaques). The primary clinical complications caused by atherosclerosis include coronary artery disease (CAD); leading to acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death; cerebrovascular disease leading to stroke. Impaired resolution of inflammation is one of the driving forces of atherosclerosis. Upregulating pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory mediators at the atherosclerotic plaques can attenuate inflammation and repair the resolution. Nanomedicines are ~100 nm particles that can encapsulate single and/ or multiple drugs inside their core and deliver them directly to the diseased sites in a sustained and controlled manner. These particles can also protect drugs from degradation in the blood circulation; lower the dosage range; minimize accumulation in other organs; and decrease the toxic side effects. In this context; we recently developed nanoparticles containing miRNAs delivered intracellularly in vivo to modulate desired pathways. In this project; we will develop novel nanoparticle systems containing pro-resolving; efflux-promoting miRNAs for targeted atherosclerosis therapy. Upon synthesis; NPs will be characterized for their physicochemical properties and study their effects on primary macrophages and mouse models.,SureshGadde,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-06,The proposed project is multidisciplinary and has different aspects.

Irrespective of their background; students will be exposed to all aspects of the project and will have the opportunity to explore and learn other skills and techniques.,None
32139,RNAi based combination nanotherapies for TNBC,The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. TNBC patients are prone to recurrence between the first and third years post-treatment; with majority of deaths within the first five years post-therapy. Chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of systemic medical treatment for TNBC; which associates with rapid drug-resistance; enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs); and disease recurrence. Two specific signaling pathways contribute to the enhancement of all CSC subtypes; and they must be co-inhibited to stop tumor regeneration after the treatment. Nanomedicines are ~100 nm size particles that can encapsulate single and/ or multiple drugs inside their core and deliver them directly to the tumors in a sustained and controlled manner. These particles can also protect drugs from the degradation in the blood circulation; lower the dosage range; minimize accumulation in other organs; and decrease the toxic side effects. In this context; we recently developed combination nanomedicine containing chemotherapeutic drug and CSCs inhibitor and studied therapeutic efficacy in animal models. Our combination nanomedicine was able to arrest tumor growth and inhibit CSCs enrichment. But; when compared to small molecule drugs/inhibitors; RNAi-agents (e.g.; siRNA; and miRNAs) can effectively and specifically knockdown target genes/proteins that are involved in drug resistance and tumor metastasis. However; RNAi-agents are highly susceptible to degradation in vivo and need to be protected and delivered to the tumors. In this project; we will develop novel nanoparticles system containing two different siRNAs and paclitaxel; and deliver them to the TNBC tumors for effective treatment. Here siRNAs will target two distinct signaling pathways involved in CSCs enrichment and drug resistance; whereas paclitaxel kills most of the bulk tumor cells. Upon synthesis; NPs will be characterized for their physicochemical properties and study their effects in TNBC cell lines and patient-derived tissue slices.,SureshGadde,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-06,The proposed project is multidisciplinary and has different aspects.

32140,Social network analysis and mining (2024),This Globalink 2024 research project focuses on social network computing and mining. Over the past few years; the rapid growth and the exponential use of social digital media has led to an increase in popularity of social networks and social computing. In general; social networks are structures made of social entities (e.g.; individual users) that are linked by some specific types of inter-dependency relationship such as friendship. The emergence of Web-based communities and hosted services such as social networking sites (e.g.; Facebook; Google+; LinkedIn; Twitter; Weibo) has facilitated collaboration and knowledge sharing between users. Most users of social media have many linkages in terms of friends; connections; and/or followers. Among all these linkages; some of them are more important than others. For instance; some friends of a user may be acquaintances; whereas some others may be close friends that care about him in such a way that they frequently post on his wall; view his updated profile; send him messages; invite him for events; and/or follow his tweets. In this project; students will apply the knowledge and skills they acquired in their undergraduate database courses to build a database for capturing relevant data from a social network. They will then develop a business intelligence solution that applies data mining techniques to social networks so as to help users of the social digital media to discover implicit; previously unknown; and useful knowledge from the social networks.,CarsonLeung,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-06-03,Similar to skill requirements for the Globalink 2013-2023 GRIs (now in top Canadian/US universities like UBC; Waterloo; Columbia; CMU & UIUC or companies like Google); students participating in this 2024 project are expected to have taken some third-year computer science courses (e.g.; database courses) when they started the internship.

32141,Data visualization and visual analytics (2024),This Globalink 2024 research project focuses on visual analytics. Due to advances in technology; high volumes of valuable data are generated at a high velocity in various real-life business applications in modern organizations and society. This leads to huge amounts of data. Embedded in these data are implicit; previously unknown and potentially useful knowledge and interesting information. Consequently; it is important to apply knowledge discovery techniques to mine these data and understand the mining results (e.g.; get an insight about the distribution of the data as well as that of the mined interesting patterns). As "a picture is worth a thousand words"; visual representation of data and the mining results is more comprehensible to users than the traditional long textual list representation. In this project; students will apply the knowledge and skills they acquired in their undergraduate database courses to build a database for capturing relevant data and/or the mining results. They will then develop a visualizer and/or visual analytics solution that applies data mining techniques to data so as to help users to visualize and analyze the raw data; as well as to understand the mining results.,CarsonLeung,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-07-02,Similar to skill requirements for the Globalink 2013-2023 GRIs (now in top Canadian/US universities like UBC; Waterloo; Columbia; CMU & UIUC or companies like Google); students participating in this 2024 project are expected to have taken some third-year computer science courses (e.g.; database courses) when they started the internship.

32142,Big data science and data analytics for useful information (2023),This Globalink 2024 research project focuses on Big data analytics. Due to advances in technology; high volumes of valuable data are generated in various real-life business applications in modern organizations and society. This leads us into the new era of Big Data. In general; Big data are interesting high-velocity; high-value; and/or high-variety data with volumes beyond the ability of commonly-used software to capture; manage; and process within a tolerable elapsed time. Hence; new forms of processing data are needed to enable knowledge discovery. Having developed systematic or quantitative processes to mine and analyze Big data allows us to continuously explore; investigate; and understand the past business performance so as to gain new insight and drive business planning. Over the past few years; several algorithms have been proposed to use the MapReduce/Spark/Flink models (which mine the search space with distributed; parallel; cloud; or fog/edge computing) for different Big data mining and analytics tasks. In this project; students will apply the knowledge and skills they acquired in their undergraduate database courses to build a database for capturing relevant information from Big data. They will then develop a data science; data analytics; and/or business analytics; business intelligence (BI) solution that applies knowledge discovery and data mining techniques to Big data so as to analyze and discover implicit; previously unknown; and useful knowledge (e.g.; frequently co-located events and/or frequent purchased bundles of merchandise items) from Big data.,CarsonLeung,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-07-29,Similar to skill requirements for Globalink 2013-2023 GRIs (now in top Canadian/US universities like UBC; Waterloo; Columbia; CMU & UIUC or companies like Google); students participating in this 2024 project are expected to have taken some third-year computer science courses (e.g.; database courses) when they started the internship.

32143,The Role of Emotion, User Experience and Persuasive Design Play in the Effectiveness of Contact Tracing Apps,Emotions play a central role in human-computer interactions. They influence human perception of and interaction with digital systems. As stated by Don Norman; every digital system has a personality just like humans. In other words; digital systems send an emotional signal; even when this was not the intention of the designer. However; there is little understanding of the “emotional signals” that persuasive technologies aimed at changing behaviors send; and how the evoked emotions can be utilized; together with user characteristics; for personalization. The goal of this research project is to: (1) design and prototype persuasive strategies for contact tracing app on smartphones and smartwatches; (2) investigate the emotions elicited by contact tracing app design; (3) explore the relationship between emotion and user experience design attributes; (4) examine the moderating effect of social-demographic variables such as culture; gender; and age; and (5) investigate how well emotions; user experience attributes; and social-demographic variables predict users’ responsiveness to persuasive strategies implemented in contact tracing apps using machine learning algorithms. Using Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotion; the study will help us to understand the types of emotion elicited by persuasive strategies such as self-monitoring and social learning implemented in contact tracing apps.

32144,Data Governance Oriented Dynamic Consent Platform for Public Health Research,We are current living in an age of ubiquitous information originated from personal smart devices and smart sensors; and such data has critical value for public health researchers that could improve general population health outcomes. The data generated by these devices contains valuable types of information; such as geolocation; vital signs; behavioral patterns; and environmental metrics are some of the most predominant ones. However; to acquire such data; they must first obtain informed consent from data subjects; and traditional means of obtaining informed consent are not adequate to collect and manage massive numbers of data subjects distributed over an entire country; province; or city. This work’s objective the development of a dynamic informed consent management platform; guided by a data governance model for public health research; that allows remote collection and management of dynamic informed consent from data subjects. Dynamic informed consent is a digital representation of traditional informed consent forms with enhanced capabilities. The proposed platform allows data subjects to browse available public health studies and decide which they wish to provide consent or not. In parallel; researchers can create study profiles to promote and explain study’s objectives and outcomes. The platform also provides features that facilitate re-consent; which avoid risks to participants and reduce participants withdrawal from studies. Moreover; institutional review boards and other stakeholders can participate in the platform and audit informed consent forms; avoiding harm to data subjects.

32146,Supporting Healthy Aging using Smart Home Technology – A Remote Monitoring Platform,Assisted-living for seniors lowers their quality of life and places financial strain on families and our healthcare system. Successful aging in place hinges on providing environments and resources that enable people to be as independent; secure; and healthy as possible. Rapid advances in technology coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT) have resulted in an amazing opportunities for the development of active assisted living (AAL) systems for monitoring and supporting healthy living. AAL technologies have the potential to monitor indoor behaviours; quantify cognitive and physical deterioration; and to identify early warnings for interventions. The goal of this research project is to develop a smart device platform to monitor in-home health behaviours to support independent living by older adults. In this project; we propose the development of an ecosystem to aggregate data from existing smart home technologies coupled with machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in everyday behaviours.

32147,Prediction of the onset of dementia and enabling remote monitoring using Ecobee's smart thermostat technology,Remote monitoring of individuals living independently is a challenging endeavor. Most remote monitoring platforms are expensive; require specific sensors to be installed in one’s home; and violates privacy. “ecobee” is a Canadian manufacturer of smart thermostats that leverages wireless sensors (temperature; presence; movement) to adjust the temperature in the house according to room occupancy and consequently save energy. Currently; non-standardized data sharing and non-standardized placement of sensors is the main challenge to the widespread use of ecobee technology in health and wellness. The partnership between University of Waterloo and ecobee will explore the use of sensor data to identify patterns in user behavior; social isolation; and mobility limitations; expanding the use of ecobee into the health and wellness domain. Leveraging recent developments in machine learning; this project will explore how a system can be trained by combining personal level data (steps; vitals; activity; etc.) with IoT sensory data (presence in the rooms). The team at the Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab (www.uwaterloo.ca/ubilab) at the University of Waterloo are in the process of designing and conducting several experiments to evaluate the application of IoT data on remote patient monitoring.

32148,Mobile Health Surveillance Platform,Public health surveillance data are the most important source of information to support decision making by public health agencies. One of the main sources of data are surveys; which traditionally have limitations related to self-reported data such as social/recall bias; loss due to follow-up; delays between collection and reporting; and costs/logistics. An alternative is the use of smart technologies as additional survey tools; as they provide zero-effort monitoring of diverse health variables (e.g.; physical activity; sleep). This project’s objective is to create a Mobile Health Surveillance platform that will collect and store health data from devices connected to Apple Health; one of the most comprehensive mobile health repositories. The platform will (i) improve social bias by providing a secure space for participants to report information; (ii) diminish recall bias; as information will be collected continuously; (iii) minimize follow-up losses; as the platform will leverage data already being collected by Canadians; (iv) minimize delays for data report with real-time analytics; (v) improve costs/logistics; as deploying an app to a large number of people is simple and cost-effective. To validate the platform; we will conduct a pilot study to predict stress in a population using mobile health data and Machine Learning algorithms. This project takes the initial steps to address limitations in traditional public health surveillance methods cancer by providing the tool and infrastructure required to collect; process and analyze mobile health data. Ultimately; this work will provide public health agencies in Canada with more accurate data to improve the health of communities and populations.

32149,Air Pollution Monitoring for Public Health Intervention,Air pollution is a global public health concern. It is responsible for a cascade of adverse health outcomes. However; quantifying the results and impacts of air pollution is difficult. The advancement of IoT and big data technologies can now allow public health officials and researchers to monitor air pollution levels and take appropriate and rapid actions to mitigate the harms. We propose the development of an agnostic ecosystem that collects big data and from various sensors; analyzes and predicts harm using AI and deep learning. This project aims to create a real-time; crowdsourced; IoT-based air quality monitoring ecosystem using IoT sensors. In doing so; these data can then be used by the national public health agency to expedite the necessary steps to mitigate the adverse impacts of air pollution. The Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab (UbiLab) has partnered with UNICEF Mongolia to create a real-time; crowdsourced; IoT-based air quality monitoring ecosystem using IoT sensors (e.g. AirVisuals; Kaitera; Plume Labs; and other sensors) that are either currently available in the community (e.g. Ulaanbaatar already has 300+ of these sensors installed in the city; owned by residents in the community). UNICEF officials have also deployed additional IoT air quality monitoring sensors across Ulaanbaatar in collaboration with the Mongolian national public health agency; focusing on increasing the monitoring in schools; kindergartens; community clinics; and hospitals. The specific research question that we are looking to address for this project is if real-time data monitoring combined with AI allows public health officials to monitor the harms of air pollution.

32150,Rôle des microvésicules d'origine plaquettaires dans la modulation de cellules immunitaires,Platelets are small anucleated cells (about 3-5 µm) in discoid shape that patrol the vascular supply to prevent blood loss. Although these cells are better appreciated for their roles in blood clotting; more and more studies show that these cells are active participants in several types of inflammatory diseases; including PAR. Activation of platelets in response to various stimuli such as collagen; thrombin or immune complexes results in the generation of 3 sub-populations of microparticles (MPs). These subpopulations of platelet MPs are abundantly present in the synovial fluid once they have arrived in the synovial fluid; these MPs can secrete a panoply of inflammatory mediators but can also be internalized by the neutrophils present in the fluid. However; the consequences of the local generation of these inflammatory mediators derived from platelet MPs and the internalization of these in neutrophils remain very little known to date. Therefore; this project aims to better understand the role of MPs in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory phases.,LucBoudreau,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-06,Training in immunology; biochemistry or chemistry would be a skill required for this project.

32152,Biomaterials for optimized building resources use,The research project will focus on the exploration and development of bio-based materials. During the first stage students will learn about several biomaterial growing techniques (i.e. mycelium; bacterial based cellulose) and will familiarize themselves with the lab experimentation protocols. Students will study: biomaterials’ growing substrates (e.g. sawdust; fabric; agricultural waste; etc.); integration of biomaterials into standard materials (e.g. aerated concrete; spray foams; expanded clay; bio-waste); form-finding processes (performance as a function of morphological studies); construction processes (3D printing; projection over surface; rigid panels). This first stage will take place at the wet lab. In a second stage; similar experiments will be conducted with local organisms and the aim will be to develop novel bio-materials adapted to the North. Thirdly; samples of bio-based materials will be regularly tested for their mechanical properties; biotic and abiotic degradation; hygrothermal properties; dimensional stability and resistance to fire. Successful bio-based materials will be used during the fourth stage to build prototypes of building units at CAST (Centre for Architectural Structures and Technology) at the University of Manitoba and; potentially deployed at selected northern communities for further performance evaluation.,MercedesGarcia Holguera,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-05,,None
32153,Define the role of ZNF in the development of cancer - in vitro and in vivo.,Cancer is the primary cause of death in Canada. It is estimated that about 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetimes and 1 in 4 will die of the disease. Despite advances in early detection and standard treatment; many cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a poor prognosis. Members of the RAS family of small GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancers. Oncogenic mutations have been found in all three members of the RAS gene family; Despite its prominent status as a cancer drug target; therapeutics aimed at blocking RAS have proven challenging thus far. Identifying proteins downstream of RAS that could be targeted to specifically harm cancer cells represents a strategy that could be used to circumvent the challenges linked to the direct inhibition of RAS. Over the last years we have identified an uncharacterized Zinc-finger protein (ZNF) as a new target of RAS. The primary objective of this project is to define the relation between ZNF and cancer development in vivo. The specific aims of our projet are to i) define the physiological impact of ZNF768 overexpression; ii) define whether ZNF affects cancer initiation and development and iii) Identify the transcriptional signature of tumours with elevated ZNF. These objectives are part of a broad research program whose long-term goal is to characterize new molecular mechanisms contributing to human cancer.,MathieuLaplante,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,I am looking for a student that has a good knowledge of the cell.

32154,Robot dynamics identification,This research project is designed to lead to the improvement of one of the most important performance criteria for collaborative robotic arms: collision detection and detection of physical interaction with the outside world. This criterion is important both for classical automation applications and for collaborative applications where a robot is required to physically interact with a person. In particular; the project will explore and evaluate methods for identifying the dynamic model of a manipulator robot. The main challenge of this objective is that existing model identification methods often focus only on the identification of inertial and kinematic parameters. This is necessary and may be sufficient for some classical applications. However; for collaborative applications; the identification of inertial properties is not sufficient to achieve a high level of transparency and responsiveness. Initial efforts will focus on identifying the sources of uncertainty and delay in the model. Then; the optimization problem that defines the identification problem will be clearly defined and optimization strategies will be developed. Then; trajectories increasing the observability of the different kinematic and dynamic parameters to be identified will be designed. Finally; a thorough experimental validation will be conducted. The robot used is a collaborative robot intended for the research of safe human-robot interaction. It is equipped with torque sensors at each joint that allows knowing the torque exerted by each motor. In addition; this robot allows the control from a computer at a frequency of 1kHz.,AndreGallant,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-01,,None
32155,High speed GPU computation for robotics,This research project is designed to lead to the improvement of one of the most important performance criteria for collaborative robotic arms: task execution speed. This criterion is important both for classical automation applications and for collaborative applications where a robot is required to physically interact with a person. This project aims at allowing the computation of a trajectory to be performed as quickly as possible (reduction of the computation time). The motion optimization problem can be divided into two categories: geometric path following and path planning without a prescribed path. While optimizing a trajectory by following a known path can be done efficiently; even in real time; optimizing a trajectory without a prescribed path remains a great challenge. The Dynamium research laboratory at the Université de Moncton is developing motion optimization algorithms; but computation time is an important consideration for the efficient deployment of such methods. To handle dynamic events during operation (e.g.; collision avoidance and task planning using computer vision); robotic manipulators must be able to modify their motion in near real-time. This project will explore the possibility of exploiting computation on graphics cards (GPU) to drastically reduce the computation time for trajectory optimization.,AndreGallant,New Brunswick,Université de Moncton,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Candidates must be students in the final stages of an undergraduate program in mechanical; electrical; mechatronics; software; computer engineering or an equivalent program.

32156,Coastal Climate Change Resilience - British Columbia,Climate models forecast further increases in temperature; more extreme weather events and a rise in sea-level; and as a result coastal communities continue to be at risk. This research seeks to document climate related threats; and shed light on the motivations; extent (embedded v. appendage); and actions (reactionary v. anticipatory) around policy and planning for climate adaptation in coastal communities; in order to better understand their preparedness for climate variability.  The study focuses on communities that have an adaptation agenda in some form; whether sophisticated or modest; or just in the works (even the just thinking about it stage). This study will provide insight into community preparedness for climate variability and contribute to the emerging literature on resilience theory. Further by exploring the decision dynamics around community adaptation plan/ policy conception and action implementation; this research will shed light on the role key actors (e.g. planners; engineers; sustainability managers etc.) play and the skills/ expertise they harness in order to help their community become resilient to an increasingly variable climate. In order to provide comparison; case study cities/ communities will be selected in order to represent a range in population and spatial size; risk to climate variability; and sophistication of adaptive action. Each location will include semi-structured interviews with key actors from the community. A range of informants will be investigated; including managers that can speak to governance around plan conception/ development; planners that can address on-the-ground implementation (e.g. transportation; land-use; utilities; emergency management); as well as key officials (councillor; mayor).

32157,BioSoil North,Limited fertility and low carbon content are the greatest restraints for agricultural production on boreal soils in northern Canada. As a consequence; landowners use diverse practices to help build soil carbon and fertility; typically drawing on locally available organic wastes. However; these local practices are not verified or calibrated. Additionally; their utility; cost effectiveness and success has not been quantified. The aim of this project is to develop a structured approach to understand the impact of organic wastes on improving soil carbon sequestration and nutrient availability while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from differently managed agricultural fields; including different soil management approaches and cropping systems; in selected boreal regions will help elucidate the relationship between agricultural productivity and soil carbon within the context of the potential of greenhouse gas emissions. This research will be undertaken on working farms in the boreal region of Labrador. The Intern will receive training in carbon and greenhouse gas sciences; soil science and agriculture. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the Memorial University of Newfoundland,MarenOelbermann,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-03,The MITACS Intern should be comfortable working in a northern environment that is more remote (not a metropolitan area).

32158,Prevention of Falls in Older Adults Through Movements,When someone falls; there are many consequences for the person and the health system. Almost 100;000 people in Canada are admitted to the hospital annually because of a fall! The best way to reduce the number of fall injuries is to exercise regularly. As a result; many communities offer exercise programs for older adults to help reduce falls. However; according to the latest Canadian report; fewer than one in ten fall prevention exercise programs provide the best program possible; meaning that programs should be offered all year long; a least three hours per week; and focus on balance activities. In addition; some Canadians do not have such a program in their region. Our team includes local; provincial; and national partners; in addition to researchers and students from Canada and Northern Ireland. They have all collaborated to plan the Attract; Adapt; IMplement and Sustain (AAIMS) project to understand how to: 1- attract people who currently do not participate in fall prevention exercise programs; 2- adapt the programs currently offered that do not meet the recommendations; 3- offer a program that follows recommendations if needed; 4- keep offering a program in community settings. The exercise program will be offered in person; online; or in a combination of the two. We will collect information by interviewing key people over the course of the project and will test how many people registered for the program; if they come with different characteristics; if there are signs that programs will last; and if people who were doing the program fall fewer times compared to the general public. This program will help us understand how to better spread a program that works in many different places while reducing participant falls.,DanielleBouchard,New Brunswick,University of New Brunswick,English,2024-05-06,The student must have a genuine interest in exercise science related to health research.

32159,Investigating the burden of recreational water illness in Canada,Swimming and other water activities at public beaches are increasingly popular leisure activities among Canadians. However; these activities can lead to increased risks of acquiring acute gastrointestinal illness and respiratory; skin; ear; and eye infections among beachgoers. These illnesses have a significant health and economic burden on society; with young children having much higher rates of illness than other agegroups. Currently; baseline data are lacking on the risk of recreational water illness in Canada; and beachgoers may lack awareness and understanding of these risks and how to prevent them. Our research team is currently conducting a series of studies investigating the burden of recreational water illness in Canada and approaches to improve recreational water surveillance and management. Examples of ongoing activities that the research assistant could be involved in include: a beach cohort study that interviews beachgoers at beaches in Canada to determine their beach water activities and risk of becoming after visiting the beach; surveillance for cyanobacterial blooms at targeted beach sites and surveys of recreational water users about illness risks; and investigation of beachgoer risk perceptions and behaviours toward recreational water quality and beach water illness risks.

32160,Applications of quantum algorithms and computers to the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives,One critical task in the use of quantum computers for pricing financial options is the loading of the distribution (univariate or multivariate) of prices for the security(ies) underlying the financial options in the state space of n qubits. If done sequentially; 2^n operations are required; so this task alone may hinder the efficiency of the quantum algorithm designed for option pricing. One possible way to address this is to relax the requirement of an exact loading of the distribution and only perform an approximate one. Among these approximate algorithms; quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs) have had a fair deal of success. A qGAN is composed of a set of two neural networks: a generator; which is hosted on a quantum computer; and a discriminator; which is usually a (classical) neural network. We start with a dataset from the distribution we want to load or with an empirical dataset we want to model. The generator is trained to produce samples with the distribution of the dataset and the discriminator is trained to distinguish the samples from the dataset from those coming from the generator. We alternate the training of each object. The resulting optimization process is not stationary and risks getting stuck without converging to a suitable solution. Our goal in this project is to explore the different choices of initial state to feed the generator; the various possible forms (or ansatze) for the generator and the different cost functions to optimize. These are just a few examples of the typical cluster of fine tuning problems that come with empirical investigations. We seek to obtain a robust algorithm that will allow for the efficient loading of several distributions of interest for financial purposes.,AlainBélanger,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,No skills available,None
32161,Design and Development of a Fast Motor Controller Board for Haptic Interaction,A stable haptic interaction with virtual environment or in teleoperation depends on the sampling frequency of the computer interface or the data acquisition board. On the other hand; to control the force or torque applied by electric motors (brushed DC motor for example); the controller should be able to control the current of the motor precisely. Fast data acquisition boards in market are very expensive and usually do not provide enough analog input/output channels with good resolution. The motor driver boards in the market do not provide precise current control. To solve these two problems; this project aims at design and development of a motor controller board including the USB communication; analog to digital and digital to analog converters; and current amplifier. The controller should have a microprocessor/microcontroller unit for controlling all other units.

32166,Sensorized Outfit for Rehabilitation,Posture monitoring is of importance in rehabilitation training to enhance training effectiveness. We have developed a set of wired and wireless sensory systems (Data-RX™) that is able to measure the orientations of the object to which the sensor is attached. In this project; we will employ multiple sensors attached to 16 points of a human body; to measure and detect the posture of the human while requested to perform a specific task. The kinematic equations of the body should be derived; and then an optimal location for each sensor should be defined in order to prototype a sensorized rehabilitation outfit (SRO) to record posture during the performance of a task. The SRO consists of accelerometers in various positions with textile integration; controlled by an RX-UI™ processor; including roll; pitch and yaw (Euler) angles; linear accelerations (3 DOFs); angular accelerations (3 DOFs); angular velocity (3 DOFs); magnetic field (3 DOFs); jerk components (3 DOFs); several key performance indicators (KPIs). The SRO will record; analyze; and real-time plot data from a variety of sensor units. The SRO will include our custom RX-UI™ software; compatible with Windows; macOS; and Linux.

32167,Persuasive and Behaviour Change Systems,The design of interactive systems for behaviour change has emerged as a growing new area of research in Human-Computer Interaction within Applied Computer Science. Avoiding risky behaviours; living a healthy lifestyle; promoting safety and security-conscious behaviours; acting to preserve the environment and reduce climate change can all benefit from Persuasive Technologies (PTs). PTs are interactive systems designed to motivate desirable behaviour change. Personalizing persuasive technologies is the act of adapting PT contents and functionalities to be appropriate for the target users and increase their relevance; motivational appeal; and hence their overall effectiveness at promoting desirable behaviour change. Despite this growing interest and investments into PTs design; current PTs suffer a major limitation: They are not personalized to be appropriate for the target user(s). Research has shown that personalizing PTs will increase their efficacy at motivating the desired behaviour change and that not personalizing PTs could be detrimental to behaviour change. However; there is little knowledge on how PTs can be personalized. To solve this problem; we propose a user-centered approach for personalizing PTs to motivate behaviour change. In this project; we are generally interested in applying the user-centered and participatory design approach (which involves the target users at every stage of the system design process) to design and evaluate PTs such as Games; Mobile; Social Media and Web Applications; and Virtual Reality that are personalized to be appropriate for the target. We are mostly interested in designing these systems to solve problems that are of global importance especially in the area of health and wellness (e.g; promoting a healthy lifestyle; physical activity; healthy eating; smoking cessation) and safety and security (e.g.; avoiding risky driving behaviour).

32168,Polymerizing a Green Future for Electronics: Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Semiconducting Polymers for Sustainable Soft Electronics,The possibility of using the human body as a platform for electronics capable of sensing a multitude of parameters and enhancing biological functionalities has been a constant focus of mankind’s imagination from the dawn of the industrial revolution. Directly inspired by biological tissues; next generation electronics have to be capable of being molded in different shapes and forms and; more importantly; being utilized directly on (or inside) the human body to enhance our connectivity to the environment and; ultimately; develop new applications such as personalized healthcare. Among others; π-conjugated polymers; a class of semiconducting materials; possess most of the properties required to enable the fabrication of this next generation bio-inspired electronics. Despite important advantages; these materials are still suboptimal for the fabrication of bio-integrated devices; mainly due to a competition between electronic and mechanical properties. Moreover; conjugated polymers are typically prepared from non-renewable precursors and processed in harmful organic solvents; which can be detrimental for their use in conjunction with biological environments. Therefore; new solutions are required to generate sustainable new π-conjugated materials with enhanced mechanical compliance and with novel properties that can facilitate their integration to the human body. The proposed research project is based on a multidisciplinary approach interlacing polymer; organic; and supramolecular chemistry for the development of new materials to be used for the fabrication of softer and deformable organic electronics with a reduced environmental footpring. This will be realized through the utilization of supramolecular chemistry and non-covalent interactions. In addition to the design and synthesis of the materials; the project will use a multitude of analytical techniques to fully characterize the materials; both mechanically and electronically.

32171,Mobile App for Patients Health Monitoring,Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an important public health problem associated with a considerable amount of morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that 5 – 10% of all hospital admissions are attributed to ADR. In Europe; about 197;000 persons die annually from the ADR-related problem. ADRs are the fourth to sixth largest cause of death in the United States. Despite being a leading cause of death; ADRs are largely preventable. The current pharmacovigilance practice relies mainly on spontaneous reporting systems and pharmacoepdemiological studies for detection and reporting of ADRs. However; these monitoring strategies do not capture all the ADR events occurring both in the hospital setting and in the general population. Therefore; additional strategies are needed to improve the monitoring and reporting of ADRs. Underreporting of ADRs is a major challenge for global pharmacovigilance and has a huge impact on the safety of medicines in public health. Although modern techniques are been developed including a web-based system; the existing monitoring strategies are inadequate and need to be integrated with fast-growing technologies. In this project; we will design a mobile app for monitoring potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) using interactive mobile applications or/and web application. Using this app; both patients and their caregivers (doctors; nurses; etc.) will monitor the patient's responses to new medications. Patients will be able to track and record their reactions to various medications; observed changes. On the other hand; doctors and nurses can analyze these patients tracked data to predict possible adverse reactions to medications and take appropriate actions to prevent further damages.,RITAORJI,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-15,The student needs to have some design skills; be interested in programming or learning programming.

The current pharmacovigilance practice rely mainly on spontaneous reporting systems and pharmacoepdemiological studies for detection and reporting of ADRs. However; these monitoring strategies do not capture all the ADR events occurring both in the hospital setting and in the general population. Therefore; additional strategies are needed to improve the monitoring and reporting of ADRs. Underreporting of ADRs is a major challenge for global pharmacovigilance and has a huge impact on the safety of medicines in public health. Although modern techniques are been developed including a web-based system; the existing monitoring strategies are inadequate and need to be integrated with fast-growing technologies. In this project; we will design and develop a home-based monitoring of potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) using interactive mobile applications or/and web application. Using this app; both patients and their caregivers (doctors; nurses; etc.) will monitor the patient's responses to new medications. Patients will be able to track and record their reactions to various medications; observed changes. On the other hand; doctors and nurses can analyze these patients tracked data to predict possible adverse reactions to medications and take appropriate actions to prevent further damages.,RITAORJI,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-05-15,The student needs to have some design skills; be interested in programming or learning programming.

32175,Artificial intelligence and human rights,With the speed of recent technological developments; it has become difficult to anticipate the next generation of artificial intelligence innovations with which human will live. In recent years; artificial intelligence softwares have increasingly appeared across the globe. Due to this rapid development; international law has not always been able to keep pace with these new types of technologies. The appearance of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations has raised plenty of legal and ethical dilemmas. Not only it directly affects fundamental human rights; such as the right to equality and privacy; AI can also conflict with some basic principles of humanity; such as freedom of thought. Lastly; the emergence of AI raises questions as to how it can benefit humans and increase their enjoyment of human rights. This project proposes to study the possible impacts of artificial intelligence on human rights from the point of view of international law. In addition to addressing the interactions between technological innovations and human rights in general; providing an introduction to some features of artificial intelligence and offering an overview of international debates on these topics; the project seeks to address artificial intelligence and legal; political and ethical questions that this phenomenon raises for the protection of human rights. Among other topics the project can cover artificial intelligence; the right to equality and discrimination; the protection of privacy; freedom of thought international humanitarian law; the right to life and integrity; responsibility and the obligation to accountability; the right to justice; human mobility and migration; as well as economic issues and social rights.,BernardDuhaime,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,Either English or French,2024-06-03,Law; international law; human rights law; technologies and the law; legal research,None
32176,Human stem cell models to study axon regeneration,Central nervous system (CNS) injuries result in permanent functional loss due to the inherent inability of adult CNS neurons to regenerate axons and re-establish connections. There are currently no effective treatments; thus the development of new therapeutic strategies to address the regenerative failure in the mature CNS and improve the quality of life for patients is essential. Cellular responses to the traumatic injury serve to limit the extent of damage in the CNS; but these responses create an inhibitory environment that prevents neurons from surviving and regenerating. Our investigations into mechanisms that regulate axon outgrowth recently uncovered two novel and unique ways to promote axonal regeneration. In this project; the student will work with senior lab members to study the mechanisms whereby these pathways control axon regeneration in the human context. Specifically; human stem cell derived neuronal lineages (cortical; motor neuron) and cerebral organoids will be employed. This work will enhance our understanding of nervous system development and axon regeneration and in the long term should provide insights that could impact therapeutic strategies for the treatment of injuries of the central nervous system.,LilianaAttisano,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-13,The student should have taken courses in molecular biology.

32177,Digital soil science: Use of machine learning algorithms for soil characterization,Soil properties vary from location to location. Therefore; we need to measure a large number of soil samples in order to characterize the soil properly. However; most of the soil properties are time-consuming; laborious; and expensive to measure which calls for new methods to overcome the issues. With the advancement of imaging techniques and the development of computing powers; computer vision-based image analysis techniques show promise to characterize soil properties. Developing reliable and robust image analysis algorithms can provide a large number of opportunities to characterize soil quickly and cheaply and transform traditional soil science into digital soil science. Soil texture (percent sand silt and clay fractions in soil) is an important factor in the decision-making of a large number of agricultural management operations; civil engineering applications; and other industries. Similarly; soil organic matter is considered the backbone of soil health and quality. This project aims to develop a reliable and robust computer vision algorithm to characterize soil texture and organic matter. In general; soil texture and organic matter are affected by the presence of soil moisture. Previously some attempts have been made to characterize soil texture and soil organic matter using computer vision techniques. However; the challenge lies in the effectiveness of those algorithms as the image quality is often affected by soil moisture. A new algorithm is to be developed or organized by combining several old algorithms to characterize soil properties. Examining the effect of soil moisture on the image quality and the performance of the newly developed algorithms on those images would provide a new way to characterize soil properties specifically soil texture and soil organic matter.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A background in computer programming and image processing is required with desirable knowledge on image collection or photography using different types of cameras; taking photographs of soil samples; collecting and processing soil samples in the laboratory and in the field; and setting up laboratory conditions to take images.

32181,Séquestration biologique du carbone par les écosystèmes forestiers et agricoles dans le cadre du programme Carbone boréal / Biological carbon sequestration by forest and agricultural ecosystems in Carbone boréal program,Carbone boreal (carboneboreal.uqac.ca) is a Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC)’s research infrastructure; managed by the Chair on eco-advising. These projects are part of a larger scale multi-facetted research program spanning many years; using Carbone boréal’s 11 research plantations (for more than one million planted and verified trees) mostly located in the boreal forest North of the Lac-St-Jean for the regular plantations and around the lake (South-East) for the agricultural ones. Carbone boréal’s plantations are established in Québec’s natural open woodlands which do not self-regenerate. Research forests are created in collaboration with Quebec’s Ministère des ressources naturelles et des forêts; in respect of forest ecosystems and biodiversity. They bear the experimental forest statute; protecting them from exploitation. Plantations on agricultural land are performed in wastelands and/or unexploitable land (slopes; edges; etc.); as determined with Quebec's Ministère de l'Agriculture; des Pêcheries et de l'Alimentation and the farmers/owners. Carbone boréal is both a University research infrastructure and a greenhouse gas offset program; through tree planting.

32182,Single-particle tracking microscopy to understand the physical organization of bacterial cell shape,Bacteria are surrounded by a rigid shell; the peptidoglycan cell wall; a single covalently linked macromolecule that gives the cell its shape and size. For cells to grow and change cell shape; dedicated proteins/enzymes need to cut covalent bonds in the cell wall and insert new cell-wall material. The question we address in this project: Can we see how a particular enzyme known to cut the cell wall contributes to the enlargement of the cell wall. To study this question we have labeled individual proteins with fluorescent labels; and we can follow their motion using single-particle tracking (SPT) in laser-based TIRF microscopy. We hypothesize that proteins transition between different states of motion: diffusive; immobile; or persistently moving. These different motion types can give us indirect information about where the molecules are active; how long they are bound to their substrate or to other enzymes; whether binding/unbinding are cooperative or require the presence of partners. However; the analysis of different motion states is complicated by noise. To interpret noisy single-particle tracks; we recently developed a statistical analysis pipeline (github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack). In this project the student will use SPT and image analysis to characterize the motion of a particular fluorescently labeled enzyme and learn if and how it contributes to cell growth.,Svenvan Teeffelen,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,The student needs to have a strong quantitative background in physics; engineering; or a related discipline; with experience in coding (preferably python and matlab).

32183,The regulation of bacterial growth,We recently developed a microscope and image-analysis pipeline that let us; for the first time; simultaneously measure the mass of single live bacteria and cell shape with unprecedented precision in live cells [see vanteeffelenlab.org for details]. A major goal of our lab is to understand how cells coordinate growth of cell shape with growth of biomass to maintain a high degree of intracellular macromolecular crowding; one of the key functions of cell-envelope growth. In this project the student will perturb different processes of biomass growth (metabolism) and envelope growth (e.g.; membrane biosynthesis) while measuring biomass and shape growth.

32184,Parallel and Scalable Design Automation Tools for High-Speed VLSI Circuits,Massive evolution that is currently taking place in the global high-technology industry has made the electronics; computing and communications products to be part of day-to-day life and highly pervasive. From the user’s end; there is an enormous demand for faster and converging multi-function designs. This is mandating the products with higher-operating speeds as well as high-density designs. At the same time; the need for higher capacity and bandwidth in wire-line communication networks drives the signal speed to multi-gigabits per second and beyond. At such high data rates; high frequency effects in electronic packages and systems such as delay; attenuation; reflection; and crosstalk become the dominant factors limiting the overall performance of microelectronic systems. In addition; with the fast rising demand for multi-function capabilities; modern designs are becoming highly complex. This is because the desire for multifunction and miniature products warrants mixed-domain integration of heterogeneous circuit components such as digital; analog; RF; optical and micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) devices. As a result; advanced accurate simulation and design methodologies become increasingly indispensable in achieving the next generation communication and computing products. However; the current design tools do not handle adequately the new emerging challenges of high-speed circuits; interconnects and mixed-domain problems. Among the major challenges faced while modeling; simulating and optimizing such design environments are the large-scale nature of the resulting equations (which tend to span in the order of millions of unknowns) as well as the mixed frequency/time difficulties arising due to the diverse nature of the associated components. However; one of the main difficulties with most of these techniques is that; they are single processor based sequential algorithms and hence can’t adequately handle the computational complexity of today’s large-scale mixed-domain designs.

32188,Computational Optimal Modelling of Mathematical Models for Infectious Diseases,Infectious disease outbreak and wide spread are always one of the most challenging public health crisis faced by all levels of governments and international organizations. The 2020 global pandemic of COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads everywhere; which caused the whole global stops to combat the virus. Scientists and researchers worldwide are working hard to find best solutions to reduce quick spread and personal mortality. How to control and mitigate the impact of disease caused on affected country’s public health and economic growth is a complicated question entangled with many factors. Mathematical modelling is widely used recently to describe the broad-scale spread of infectious diseases; and is very useful to provide best designed control measures specific to different diseases. From acute disease such as influenza to chronic infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HIV; the real challenge lies in several aspects of the mathematical modelling process. Various transmission patterns; different incubation periods and transmission periods; variable age structure for different patient groups will lead to complex structured mathematical models. Building detailed mathematical models specific to one disease is an enjoyable process to refresh knowledge from public health/epidemiology; mathematical modelling; numerical simulation; data analysis; etc. Mathematical analysis is essential to investigate the disease dynamics while the complete analysis is always challenging. Computational study is an alternative realization for model analysis; combined with data assimilation. One-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are typical mathematical models for age-structured; multi-staged disease transmission and infection progression. The model analysis and its numerical simulation attract more attention in interdisciplinary areas of applied mathematics; epidemiology and public health. Designed control is preferred for realistic consideration for policy decision. Optimization theory is the right tool to utilize to realize the ideal scenarios for better disease control and prevention.,HongbinGuo,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,Familiar with the basic theory and their numerical simulations to ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation; basic knowledge of optimization theory and its applications; basic statistical knowledge and skills to deal with data analysis; to use numerical software such as Matlab; Maple; R; Python etc. Interests on infectious disease modelling and prediction.,None

32191,Microbiome of water systems,One of the best-studied water-borne bacterial pathogens; in term of its interaction with phagocytic protozoans; is Legionella pneumophila. This species is an important; but often underestimated; cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. Transmission occurs primarily by inhalation of contaminated water droplets; but the exact mechanism and other factors influencing virulence remain unclear. Once in the lungs; Legionella infects and replicates inside alveolar macrophages and causes widespread tissue damage. Legionella grows in water system within a wide variety of phagocytic protozoans; such as amoeba and ciliates; that prey on other microorganisms. We have previously studied the microbiome of a few water systems and identified a few species of bacteria and eukarya associated with the presence or absence of Legionella. The goal of this project is to study the interactions of Legionella with the resident microbiota in water systems.

32194,Color on demand: special wide-gamut emissive polymer blends for light emission applications,We want to create high-intensity inherently luminescent polymer blends whose colors and morphology can be fully controlled. If successful; this work could create a new class of ultra-bright materials covering a wide emission bandwidth. Fluorescent polymers could replace conventional materials for a range of applications in biomedicine; sensing; imaging; and light emission applications. An important point is to control the emission spectrum of organic fluorophores for a wide range of potential applications. The synthesis methods recently were published by us. That is the starting point. Next; we want to do two major things. First; we want to develop this technique for making really well-controlled mixed color polymer blends using combinations of red; green; and blue emitting materials. Several difficulties will have to be overcome though - for example; the starting polymers must be soluble all together in the same solvents; and they must not not mix too finely when solidified into particles. Several different solvents and polymer molecular weights may have to be tested. Organic color-change fluorescent laser dyes developed in our work may play an important role as well. We would like to make mixed-color and high-brightness polymer microspheres having all the same size and structure. We plan to achieve this by using microfluidic methods; so that we can precisely control the droplet parameters; which is very different from what we achieved so far.

32200,Design of a complete electronic architecture for a life-size high-speed quadruped robot,The Robotarium research lab at the University of Calgary (https://www.uvs-robotarium-lab.ca/) is developing highly-articulated multi-legged robots for deployment inside unstructured confined spaces as those encountered inside collapsed buildings. For this; we are developing control; electronic hardware; and software tools to enable effective robot operation. The goal of this project is to assist in developing a complete electronic system to operate (control); and capture sensor data for a new 14 Degrees of Freedom high-speed acrobatic quadruped robot. The robot is targeted to be used in urban search and rescue operations by exploiting its full-body motion capabilities to perform complex motion tasks such as crawling; walking on rough surfaces; climbing over complex structures; and perform acrobatic maneuvers (backflips). In this project; students will start from an existing electrical and electronic architecture (develop by previous students) to generate a revised and enhanced electronic and sensing system for the robot. The electrical architecture to be developed will include a power management board to provide power to all the robot's components (e.g.; DC motors; sensors; onboard computers; etc.) via batteries; and suitable PCBs for motor control. For this; students will design and develop needed printed circuit boards (PCBs) such as power management PCBs; and emergency stop buttons. Once a suitable electrical and electronic system is completed students will manufacture the PCBs and implement them in the real robot for testing. The overall goal of the project will be for the robot to have an effective and safe electrical system with emergency stop buttons; suitable ON/OFF systems; and power management PCBs that will provide the required power to the different components of the robot.,AlejandroRamirez-Serrano,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,The student(s) participating in this project will be required to have strong knowledge in the design of electrical systems; design of PCBs; embedded systems; and basic software tools.

One student will participate in this project working with a graduate student focusing on the PCB design and developing the needed electrical architecture.,None
32201,Priming neuroblastoma 3D spheroid models for NK cell-based immunotherapy,High-risk neuroblastoma patients have a poor outcome. Treatment failure highlights the complexity to replicate neuroblastoma in preclinical models. Even though; neuroblastoma cell lines cultivated in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers carry oncogenic mutations; their transcriptome and epigenome differ considerably from tumours in situ; impeding on the discovery of efficient treatments. This has led to increasing interest in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models where the 3D microenvironment causes transcriptomic and epigenomic changes to better replicate tumour biology. Thus; we developed and characterized 3D neuroblastoma spheroids. Unlike 2D monolayers; 3D spheroids express neuroblastoma lineage-defining master transcription factors and epigenetic regulators; replicating tumours in patients. These changes correlate with novel pharmacological sensitivity to epigenetic/anticancer drugs; as compared to 2D monolayers. Moreover; 3D spheroids exhibit an immunological signature associated with resistance to natural killer (NK) cell mediated lysis; replicating neuroblastoma in situ. Cytotoxic assays using NK cells confirmed the resistance of 3D spheroids to NK cell killing; as compared to parental cells in 2D. Thus; our 3D spheroids better replicate high-risk neuroblastoma as compared to 2D monolayers and can be used to investigate resistance to NK cell immunotherapy. We hypothesize that epigenetic drugs can reprogram 3D spheroids to prime neuroblastoma cells to NK cell based lysis using NK-92 and CAR-NK cells. Overall; our proposal aims to discover drugs that prime tumour cells prior to the infusion of NK cells to to cure pediatric high-risk neuroblastoma.,NoëlRaynal,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,Skills in Cell culture amd molecular biology are an asset.

32202,Nutritional Profile of Commercial Complementary Foods for Infants in Canada,Public health guidelines recommend introducing complementary foods (CFs) to infants at 6 months of age. One of the current drivers of the infant food market is a rising demand for organic; plant-based products; yet many still contain processed ingredients. As claims related to nutrition and health are often found on commercial CF packaging; these may not be representative of the actual ingredients and nutritional composition of the product. In order to obtain an accurate representation of infant food composition and quality in Canada; a national nutritional assessment of existing products will be conducted. The aims of this study are to 1) assess the nutritional composition of CFs targeted towards infants up to 24 months of age (e.g.; energy; protein; carbohydrates; fat; sugar; iron; sodium and calcium); 2) compare the nutritional composition of organic vs non-organic plant-based CFs; 3) assess the quality of CFs; and 4) compare the food claims of commercial CFs with their actual nutrition facts. A sample of commercial CFs in Canada will be collected from websites; local supermarkets; and other food stores. Nutritional composition will be assessed by age group (Aim 1) and food type (Aim 2). Quality assessments will be conducted according to Health Canada recommendations (e.g.; food diversity) and the NOVA food classification system (i.e. degree of processing) (Aim 3). Nutrition-related claims will be classified into composition; nutrition; and health categories (Aim 4). The student will also have an opportunity to contribute to ongoing projects in the PEADS laboratory focused on breastmilk composition and the evolution of the intestinal microbiota in infants.,MaryamKebbe,New Brunswick,University of New Brunswick,English,2024-05-01,I welcome students from various backgrounds because my goals as a mentor are to provide students with the opportunity to explore new areas of research and; upon joining the lab; the training required for successful completion of the study.

32207,Studying soilborne fungal pathogen Sclerotinia scleortiorum using molecular genetics and genomics,Studying soilborne fungal pathogen Sclerotinia scleortiorum using molecular genetics and genomics Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is one of the most notorious soilborne pathogens on earth. It causes white mold diseases in diverse hosts including canola; soybean; lettuce; peanuts; etc. Its ability to form sclerotia; the overwintering structure; is crucial for its survival in nature. Although this pathogen causes devastating diseases on many plants; our understanding on how it forms sclerotia and how it causes diseases in diverse hosts is limited. During the past few years; our group has developed a novel forward genetic pipeline for gene discovery in this pathogen. The student will be involved in mutant screening to search for mutants that are defective in either sclerotial formation or virulence. Once the mutants are confirmed; the DNA will be extracted for next-generation sequencing. Mutations in these mutants will be identified and downstream knockout or complementation tests will be carried out to confirm the exact mutation that is responsible for the observed phenotypes. Through the Mitacs program; the student will get training in methodologies in molecular biology; genetics; genomics and plant pathology. Genetic pathways will be analyzed; and protein-protein interactions will be assayed. He/She will be required to read original research papers and join group discussion meetings.

32209,Long-Term Software Engineering,Drasil is a set of tools; written in Haskell; that provides for a completely different workflow for generating correct software; as part of large certifiable program families. One of the key ingredients is code generation; which helps make the coding of traditional artifacts more portable and more reusable. Furthermore; influenced by literate programming and org-mode; we have a means of doing knowledge capture of the fundamental laws of physics; basic mathematics and methods of software construction. Once foundational knowledge has been entered; it can be infinitely re-used. This deconstruction of software into pieces finer-grained than components; classes; etc; greatly facilitates re-use by allowing many more compositions of pieces. And because the knowledge is documented; a lot of normally tedious documentation can now be generated. The result is software that is both solid and documented; without the tedium usually associated with such tasks. The fundamental idea is to "generate all the things". By understanding what all the artifacts that usually make up a complete piece of software -- including tests; build instructions; theory manuals; user manuals; and so on -- we see that they are mostly composed of the same information but arranged in different ways. Of course; this is natural and reasonable; as the pieces are indeed talking about the same software! This very repetition is the source of our compression and re-use techniques.,JacquesCarette,Ontario,McMaster University,English,2024-05-06,We are looking for solid programmers who are very eager to learn new ideas. Someone who thinks they know all there is about programming will not be happy in our project; as we deconstruct all the usual methodologies of software engineering and turn them sideways. And we use ideas from many different other disciplines; while somewhat mathematics-centric; we also use a lot of physics and dip into knowledge management; philosophy and social sciences as necessary. Eagerness to learn; as well as re-learn new ways of thinking on old ideas; is very important.,None
32210,Exploring databases in digital forensic investigations,Because databases play a critical role in many computing systems and organizations; they are often exploited to facilitate crimes or hide information that can be useful during digital investigations. Database forensics research has seen some advances over the last decade but several aspects of forensic investigations involving database systems are yet to be addressed. In earlier work; we showed that different dimensions can be involved in a database forensic analysis. Much of the existing research works have focused on different aspects of these dimensions but in many cases from the perspective of specific database management systems; mostly relational databases. Thus; limiting the ability to incorporate some of the results into tools and practices. In addition; although database forensics is in practice a part of the digital investigation process; it has not been explored as such. The goal of the project is to consider database forensics through the lens of more established subdisciplines of digital forensics such as mobile forensics; network forensics; multimedia forensics; and computer forensics to provide insights into aspects of database forensics that are yet to be addressed. By considering each of the phases of the digital forensics process; we will review existing works in other subdomains of digital forensics to identify aspects of database forensics that require further research attention to advance the field. In addition; we will explore the integration of database forensics in the forensic analysis of mobile devices using data corpora for digital forensics research. Through this; we aim to provide guidelines for integrating information from the databases on many digital devices into the forensics investigation of such devices.,Mary OluwasolaAdedayo,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-13,We seek students with prior knowledge of both relational and non-relational database systems and an interest in digital forensics and/or cybersecurity.

32211,Comparative study of machine learning based approaches for file type identification,The ability to identify the type of a file and by extension; its structure is an important aspect of digital forensics analysis and computer security in general. For example; it is useful for intrusion detection systems; firewalls; the development of antiviruses; steganalysis; etc. Over the years; a considerable amount of research has been conducted on identifying file types from file fragments and several methods that use the content-based approach e.g.; File header/trailer analysis have been widely adopted. More recently; approaches that are based on the classification of file fragments using machine learning techniques have been explored or combined with content-based approaches. The goal of this project is to conduct a comparative study of the machine learning approaches for file type identification. The project will focus on both the analysis of complete files as well as those of file fragments. We aim to identify the challenges and benefits of the different approaches. This project forms part of the exploratory phase of a larger objective to develop approaches for authenticating digital documents. The first phase of the project will involve an understanding of existing techniques for file type identification through a review of existing literature. The second phase will involve a comparative study of some of the popular approaches identified in the first phase. Through this study; we hope to identify key features and approaches that can be leveraged when analyzing files to identify other details that can be useful for forensic digital document examination.,Mary OluwasolaAdedayo,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-13,We seek students with some computer science background and an interest in digital forensics and/or cybersecurity.

32212,Feminist urban spaces,This research project involves feminist urban spaces; particularly recent ones. Spatial structure and social structure are mutually constitutive. Place is invested with meaning (Spain; 2014). Feminist urban spaces have existed since the 1970s in the form of community centres; libraries; feminist associations and help centres. Most of them were created by feminist associations as a reference point for the feminist movement and as an outreach to women. Just as feminist in the 1970s and 1980s built their rights into the city with women’s centers; credit unions; and feminist health clinics; feminists in the 2020s are building their right to the city with public spaces and urban commons. These places created by and for women; declare women’s rights to public space. A new generation of feminist spaces both in buildings and feminist public spaces have emerged in cities such as Rome; Barcelona; and Montevideo. This exploratory reseach project aims at documenting the different types of feminist urban spaces in Europe; Latin America and Canada; documenting their dates of creating; their functioning; the feminist theories and practices around them and their influence on the feminist movement and urban environment. We will expore questions such as: How do these places empower women? How can cities and urban spaces be potentially emancipatory if the appropriate conditions and interventions are nurtured (Chant; 2016)? The goals of this research project are to gather information and empirical data on feminist urban spaces and to explore the literature around theories on feminist spaces and urban feminism. This will include documentary research on the feminist urban spaces: when and how they emerged; how long they have existed and the changes they have went through; who runs them and who uses their services and space; what kind of governance exists.,CharmainLevy,Québec,Université du Québec en Outaouais,Either English or French,2024-06-10,The student should have a strong background in social sciences (sociology; anthropology; womens/feminist studies or urban studies).

This project examines the role performance arts can play in seeking new methods to communicate the difficult nexus between migration and neo-nationalism. I will study the strategies used by five European theatre companies to negotiate the limitations imposed on their work by their state-generated funding while at the same time maintaining their artistic and political freedom. The only art form that must be experienced live; performance arts (including text based theatre and dance) carry strong traditions and means to provoke and challenge the authority of the state and its politics. Not only did nationalism in the forms of its totalitarian systems and fascism mark the historical experience of the 20th century Europe; it also stimulated the escalation of theatrical traditions to respond and to resist its political and ideological practices,YanaMeerzon,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-01,My research assistant is expected to have advanced skills in reading and working with academic literature in the fields of cultural studies; sociology; literature or performance studies.

32214,Algorithmic and digital policing,Many law enforcement agencies use artificial intelligence and algorithmic technologies in their work. Little research has been done on exploring some of the different uses of AI and algorithmic technologies to understand their limitations and aspects of technology that are being ignored in their use. This project is part of a bigger project that aims to address this using different research methods. The project aims to explore existing literature that documents the use of technology; AI; and algorithmic tools for law enforcement. Based on the initial analysis; we will focus on the technologies that are mostly used to identify how such technologies can be improved for the justice system and to address human rights concerns that have been identified with the use of some technologies.

32217,Targeted mutagenesis of candidate cis-regulatory elements in rice (Oryza sativa) using CRISPR/Cas9,Plants have unique strategies for countering changes in their environment. reprogramming gene expression. Although the the importance of cis-regulatory elements in gene regulation has been demonstrated in many genomes; their effect on transcriptional reprogramming and their specific response to stress remains poorly understood in plants. Transposable elements; abundant and diverse mobile sequences of non-coding DNA; can be key sources of cis-regulatory sequences. An evolutionary process known as exaptation causes transposable element sequences to change function; serving as raw material for the emergence of sequences useful to the host genome. In plants; there is still relatively little experimental evidence for the role of exaptation of transposable elements into cis-regulatory sequences. The aim of our research project is to develop an integrative approach combining bioinformatics and genome editing; in order to better understand the impact of cis-regulatory sequences exapted from transposable elements in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. We have already identified candidate sequences; and the proposed project for the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship is to assist in the experimental phase. To experimentally test the effect of candidate cis-regulatory sequences on gene regulation; we will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genetic excision of candidates in the rice genome. We will use a CRISPR-Cas9 protocol already optimized in the laboratory from the infection of rice callus (clusters of undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells obtained from rice seeds). To assess the impact of cis-regulatory element mutations on gene expression; plants homozygous for the mutation will be subjected to RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis to detect mutation-induced changes in gene expression.,ZoéJoly-Lopez,Québec,Université du Québec à Montréal,Either English or French,2024-05-27,The candidate must have completed a course in genetics and/or molecular biology.

32219,Biostability of food protein-based nanodelivery vehicles,The inherent structural and biophysicochemical properties of proteins; such as binding; encapsulation; stability; biocompatibility; biorecognition; bioavailability and biodegradability; have contributed to the applications of various kinds of proteins as delivery agents for functional food formulation. They have also been widely used in the food; pharmaceutical and medical industry for the delivery of bioactive compounds; but little attention has been given to some of the potential health effects. It is overgeneralization as observed in most literature to assume that proteins should digest after delivery of bioactive compounds; considering the small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio of protein nanoparticles. The interaction of protein nanoparticles with bioactive compounds and gastrointestinal fluid may affect the engineered properties of the proteins. Limited information is available on the possible bioaccumulation of organic (e.g. protein) nanoparticle and their interaction with biological systems (cell; tissue and organ). Also; there is need to explore how the structure of a given protein can pose a negative health effect when used as delivery agents; especially during interaction with the bioactive compounds and gastrointestinal fluid. It is also necessary to investigate how the structure of proteins and the biological environment can affect the desired target release. This study will involve the use of various simulated gastrointestinal and biological models; advanced techniques and various characterization methods to understand the interaction of protein nanodelivery agents and the gastrointestinal system. The research will evaluate the stability of the nanoparticles and if they can interact with the components of a simulated gastrointestinal environment. The project will also investigate the localization; biological fate and behaviours of the food protein nanoparticles.,ChibuikeUdenigwe,Ontario,University of Ottawa,English,2024-05-08,Student should have an academic background in any of the following undergraduate courses: chemistry; biochemistry; biology; physics; nutrition; or pharmaceutical sciences.

32221,Machine Learning of Auto Insurance Big Data for Before, During, and Post Pandemic,Much research focuses on studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; but less work is addressing problems on the effect of the post-COVID-19 pandemic when compared to before and during the pandemic. In the domain of auto insurance; some research questions may be asked: • What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in future regulation rules such as the benchmarks of the major risk factors? • What will be the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic when it comes to Usage-Based Insurance (UBI); where driving habits and driving distances are critical components in pricing? • Does the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lead to a necessary reform of auto insurance benefit coverage? The issues discussed above will significantly impact the decision-making of auto insurance rate filings; as they will affect future insurance premium rate changes. Especially the impact on UBI because working remotely may become a new norm after the pandemic. On the other hand; the social and economic impact of COVID 19 can lead to a significant change in the insurance market; and the fairness of insurance premiums may also be affected. Thus; to ensure that the premium levels are fair and correct for all drivers; which is required by the regulation rules; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cost-saving and the future insurance premium rate changes must be studied. This impact of COVID-19 may include before; during; and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore; the cost reduction (or; in some cases; potential increase) due to the COVID-19 pandemic must be reflected in new premium calculations and insurance regulations. This research mainly focus on analyzing statistical plan data to answer all existing and future research questions; with an aim to see the effect from COVID-19 pandemic on loss and premium patterns.,ShengkunXie,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-06-03,Students should have knowledge and skills in collecting and organizing data and conducting statistical analysis and modeling using both statistical and computational approaches.

Then; the strains will be inoculated alone or together on plants of interest; and their effect on plant growth will be examined using a state-of-the-art phenotyping platform. The proportion of different strains and their ability to colonize the root will be monitored over time by enumeration or 16S region qPCR. In a second step; the consortia capable of effectively promoting plant growth will be tested under abiotic stress conditions (water stress; temperature increase; low soil nutrient levels) to determine if they still act beneficially. Also; monitoring the different species of bacteria in these consortia will allow us to determine how the bacterial consortia adapt to the environment; and whether or not the communities are stable.,Pascale B.Beauregard,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-07-29,The student must have a strong background in microbiology and be familiar with the theory of common molecular biology techniques (PCR; agarose gels; dilution and enumeration; (...)).

32223,Vaccine developing for porcine coronavirus,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in serious losses of human lives as well as the global economy. Vaccination has been one of the most effective measures in combating the pandemic. Coronaviruses can cause devastating consequences in animals as well. For example; porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alpha-coronavirus that causes up to 100% fatality in newborn piglets. Like the SARS-CoV-2 virus; multiple PEDV variants have emerged in pig farms. Unfortunately; current vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against PEDV infections.

32224,Quantum control of molecular super-rotors with an optical centrifuge,MAIN OBJECTIVE. Our research is focused on expanding the boundaries of controlling quantum systems with light. Specifically; we develop new methods of exciting extreme rotational states of molecules – the so called “molecular super-rotors”; and investigate the effects of ultra-fast rotation on the quantum systems of interest; e.g. superfluid helium and helium nanodroplets. BACKGROUND. Control of molecular rotation has been long recognized and successfully used as a powerful tool for steering chemical reactions; imaging individual molecular orbitals; generating extreme ultraviolet radiation; deflecting molecular beams and separating molecular isotopes. Recent theoretical studies have indicated enormous potential of extending the reach of rotational control to ultra-high rotational states. Ultrafast molecular spinning has been predicted to change the character of molecular collisions with solid surfaces; alter molecular trajectories in external fields and suppress collisional decoherence. New ways of molecular cooling and selective chemical bond breaking by inducing super rotation have been suggested. Yet; owing to the challenges of bringing a large number of molecules to fast synchronous rotation; very little experimental work has been done on molecular super rotors. METHODOLOGY. Our research team is developing two new approaches to ultrafast rotational control of molecules. (1) We have recently built an “optical centrifuge” in which molecular rotation is achieved by forcing the molecules to follow the rotating polarization of a laser field. Using the centrifuge technique; we have succeeded in producing; observing and controlling molecular super rotors. (2) We are also developing a method of exciting extreme rotational states with high-power ultra-short pulse trains. Each laser pulse in the train exerts a small torque on a molecule; making it rotate toward the field polarization. The cumulative effect of multiple pulses enables one to induce fast molecular rotation without breaking the molecule apart.,ValeryMilner,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,We are looking for a senior student with experience in the field of optics. Familiarity with lasers; vacuum systems; mechanical design and numerical analysis is a plus; although not a must.,None

32226,Cell-Matrix adhesion in tissue development & homeostasis 2024,Cell adhesion regulation plays a key role in animal development and tissue maintenance: Adhesion proteins of the integrin family are the core components of an adhesion complex that is important for attaching cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins are involved in many biological processes including cell migration; organogenesis; and the maintenance of tissue integrity under conditions of mechanical stress. Our lab looks at how the regulation of the assembly; strength; and turnover of integrin adhesions contributes to animal development and tissue maintenance. My lab uses genome-engineering techniques to create animal models containing mutations that disrupt key regulatory mechanisms that control integrin-mediated Cell-ECM adhesion. We then analyse these mutants in diverse biological contexts. The MITACS funded project will involve analysing such animal models using advanced quantitative imaging; live imaging of primary cell culture and cultured whole embryos and explants. Moreover; histology and immunohistochemistry will be used to analyse functional defects that arise during embryonic development that effect the regulation of cell migration and stable cell adhesion. The work will be carried out in either the genetic model organism Drosophila Melanogaster or in mouse models. Working under the supervision of a senior member of the lab the student will learn cutting edge techniques of imaging to analyse the cell morphology; cell migration; and localization of intracellular components in different compartments within cells of interest. The work carried out by the student will provide novel insight into the physiological roles of different regulatory mechanisms that operate on integrin-based adhesions.,GuyTanentzapf,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,We are seeking an eager; hard-working student interested in the fields of developmental and cell biology; and advanced imaging technology.

32228,Intelligence-Driven Smart Contracts Vulnerability Detection and Characterization System (SCsVulLyzer),The research project; SCsVulLyzer; aims to develop an automated system that utilizes genetic algorithms to analyze and detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts that automatically enforce the rules and regulations of an agreement between parties. These contracts are often executed on a blockchain; which provides a secure and decentralized environment for conducting transactions. However; smart contracts are also vulnerable to various types of attacks; such as reentrancy and integer overflow attacks. The proposed system will analyze the bytecode of smart contracts and identify vulnerabilities using a genetic algorithm.,ArashHabibi Lashkari,Ontario,York University,English,2024-05-01,In addition to developing the SCsVulLyzer system; the project will also involve generating a benchmark dataset of vulnerable and non-vulnerable smart contracts to evaluate the performance of the system. This benchmark dataset will be an essential component of the project as it will provide a standard for evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the system.,None
32229,Fast and non-destructive spectroscopic characterization of soil health,Sustainable soil management is only possible through better management which is dependent on better measurement. However; the status quo approach to characterize soil relies on systematic soil sampling followed by laboratory analysis which is often inadequate; economically infeasible; and unbiased measurement density that makes the quality of the obtained information and management decisions questionable. Many proximal soil sensing systems are based on measuring the soil’s ability to reflect or emit energy in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with a wavelength range of 350-2500 nm has gained tremendous attention as it can simultaneously predict multiple soil properties. This project aims to develop a fast and non-destructive soil health characterization technique using soil spectroscopy. The project will involve collecting soil samples; organizing; processing; and analyzing them in the laboratory; scanning soils using spectrometers; and developing a database and predictive relationships using machine learning techniques.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in handling soil samples in the laboratory and in the field. Background on measuring soil properties in the field and collecting soil samples for measurement in the laboratory is required.

Developing predictive models using regression-based and machine learning-based techniques will also be an asset.,None
32230,Developing a cell phone app to characterize soil organic matter,Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered as the backbone of soil health or soil quality and influences many physical; chemical and biological properties and processes. For example; SOM influences soil structure; affects water holding capacity; nutrient contributions; biological activity; water infiltration; air exchange; pesticide activity; soil compressibility; and shear strength. It is a critically important property that determines soil functionality and use. Proper characterization of SOM can help make informed management decisions for agro-environmental operations. The two most common methods of SOM estimation are Walkley Black acid digestion and weight loss on ignition. However; the requirement of specialized equipment's; trained professionals; time for analysis and sample preparation; cost; and labor pose challenges in measuring SOM on a large number of samples in order to characterize and map soils with high spatial variability. Spectroscopic characteristics measured using Vis-NIR or NIR sensors have shown promise in predicting SOM in laboratory ex-situ conditions or at the field in situ conditions. However; the high price and often the portability of these instruments restrict their common use. With the advancement of imaging techniques and the development of computing powers; computer vision-based image analysis techniques show promise to characterize soil properties including SOM as it contributes to the color of the soil. Along with good cameras and other advanced imaging techniques; cell phones became an increasingly popular device for photographs. The availability of cell phones with high processing power and image collection capability could provide us new ways to characterize soil. This project aims to develop a cell phone app to characterize SOM. In developing the app; reliable and robust image analysis algorithms need to be developed. So; the first part of the project is to develop an algorithm that can analyze images of various qualities and then develop an app for cell phones.,AsimBiswas,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in cell phone app development; computer programming; and image processing is required with desirable knowledge on image collection or photography using different types of camera; taking the photographs of soil samples; collecting and processing soil samples in the laboratory and in the field; and setting up laboratory conditions to take images.

Critical thinking and comprehending knowledge are also required in this project.,None
32231,Performance verification study of OncoProfiler for multiple cancer diagnosis,The cancer diagnosis process may seem long and frustrating because of the high false-positive rate; 10% for a mammogram and 30-50% for low-dose CT; the gold standard methods for screening breast cancer and lung cancer; respectively. Follow-up tests have to be performed with additional imaging or tissue-biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. In addition to the invasive nature of these processes; image and tissue biopsy-based diagnosis methods can detect tumors only when it is above 1 cm size: by then some cancers progress to advanced stages. As a non-invasive test; blood-based liquid biopsy diagnostics has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of current techniques. Proteins and peptides in blood plasma are commonly used as biomarkers to indicate the presence of cancer. Since these biomarkers are not unique to cancer; they are not used to confirm the diagnosis but to indicate further cancer tests. Besides; blood biomarkers cannot predict the localization of cancer or sub-typing of cancer without histology. Detection of mutations in the very early stages is almost impossible. Therefore; existing methods of liquid biopsy remain as a complementary tool in cancer diagnosis. The clinical utility of blood-based cancer diagnosis is still minimal. Researchers at Toronto Metropolitan University have invented OncoProfiler; a quantum sensor enhanced Raman microscopy. The device offers single-molecular detection sensitivity and is capable of identifying biomarkers that are previous undetectable due to their extreme low concentration in blood stream. By employing new biomarkers; OncoProfiler has demonstrated high accuracy in cancer diagnosis from patient blood samples. The proposed project tests the performance of OncoProfiler with a large set of blood samples from patients with confirmed cancer diagnosis. We aim to test 12 different types of cancers; including colorectal; bladder; head and neck; hepatobiliary; lung; lymphoma; leukemia; ovary; pancreas; myeloma; esophageal/gastric; breast; thyroid; kidney; endometrium; prostate; melanoma; and sarcoma.,BoTan,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,Formal education in Biomedical engineering; medical science and related field; experience of lab experiments; graphic generation and editing; knowledge of machine learning is a plus.,None
32232,Medical image segmentation using machine learning,Many medical imaging modalities generate a large number of images per patient in each scan. For instance; a typical short-axis cardiac MRI sequence consists of more than 200 images; and manual segmentation of ventricles from all these images might take more than 20 minutes. Only a limited set of measurements associated with the scan is computed in regular clinical practice. Automating the analysis could lead to a comprehensive analysis of the underlying condition. However; automating the analysis using traditional image processing approaches poses a number of challenges; including accurately identifying the regions of interest. Recent studies have shown that deep learning approaches have the ability to accurately delineate the regions of interest provided that they are trained with sufficient data. This study aims to utilize deep learning to delineate structures from medical images. The project will exploit the recent advances in deep learning-based segmentation approaches proposed for general computer vision applications. We will rely on the original medical images and the corresponding annotations produced by expert clinicians to train; validate and test deep learning solutions. Obtaining large datasets to train neural network algorithms is often a challenge in medical imaging.

32233,Development of extended reality image visualization techniques for medical images,Our lab focuses on the development of advanced 3D visualization and navigation approaches to facilitate the analysis of cardiac ultrasound; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) data. Although the actual heart motion is a complex set of motions in 3D space; current clinical settings are capable of visualizing them only in 2D. We develop stereographic and virtual environments to facilitate the interactions between radiologists; cardiologists and surgeons in planning surgical and other procedures. Most of the existing medical visualization systems rely on the keyboard and mouse of a personal computer for user interaction; and therefore; have limited interaction in 3D. A system based on zSpace (zSpace Inc.; Sunnyvale; CA; USA) is expected to overcome these limitations via the use of a stylus and other types of input devices that allow users to interact in 3D space. The zSpace system also consists of a high-definition 3D stereo display system and has the ability to track the viewing angle of the user. The proposed project will focus on development of the display system for medical images by using the Unity3D (Unity Technologies; San Francisco; CA; USA) development environment. An advantage of using Unity3D is that it can be adapted to other types of display devices such as head-mounted displays (Oculus Rift; HTC Vive; etc.) with minimal additional programming. Beyond programming the stylus based interaction; the project will also investigate the usage of different input devices such as a game or Xbox controller; Leap Motion controller (Leap Motion Inc.; San Francisco; CA; USA) and 3D mouse to improve the user’s ability to interact with the 3D environment.,KumarPunithakumar,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The project requires programming skills in C# and Python.

32234,Systematic Quantitation of Glycoxidative Stress in Biological Systems,Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in the cell. It is chemically reactive and can undergo an undesired reaction with different classes of biomolecules; such as amino acids and proteins; affecting their physicochemical properties and potentially their biological functions. Known as nonenzymatic glycation; this reaction generally occurs at a slow rate and is a major component of the aging process in living organisms. A broad range of physiological complications; such as diabetes; cataracts; neurodegenerative diseases; and cardiovascular diseases has been linked to nonenzymatic glycation. Previous studies have shown that nonenzymatic glycation accelerates under oxidative stress conditions. Heavy metals; such as iron and copper; can induce oxidation and facilitate oxidative reactions. Some studies have; therefore; postulated that selective decreasing of endogenous metal levels may have a controlling effect on nonenzymatic glycation. Several classes of natural compounds that bind the excess amounts of heavy metals were found to have an inhibitory effect on nonenzymatic glycation in humans; however; the underlying mechanism of this process is not fully understood. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop methods for quantitative study of nonenzymatic glycation in biological systems. Through this project; we aim to identify new biomarkers that can help better understand the glycation reaction at a systemic level and develop methods to monitor and control the nonenzymatic glycation reaction in living organisms.,MakanGolizeh,Alberta,Concordia University of Edmonton,English,2024-05-13,The student must have the basic understanding of analytical chemistry; especially of biological systems.

32237,Big data analytics for intelligent manufacturing,Nowadays; manufacturing is towards smart factories at a high pace. Turning into intelligent manufacturing enables a lot of challenges for engineers. Smart factories have tones of sensors with a high frequency of sense. That means different types of data are generated at high speed and high volume. In other words; we have all three factors of big data; variety; velocity and volume. Handling big data has different types of challenges. First; there is a need to manage the communication between sensors and handle the data flow. Second; logging the generated data in real-time is vital. Third; store the data in the proper database considering the data structure and query types. Fourth; real-time data analytics of the stored or streamed data. Dealing with all of the above challenges is tough; especially in manufacturing. In manufacturing; multiple sensors need to communicate and there is a need to record the events due to the scheduling; optimization and security tasks. This project will focus on the design and development of the workflows and data management frameworks that work in the context of industrial big data.

32238,Connecting Best Practices for Teaching Linguistically and Culturally-Diverse International Students with International Student Satisfaction and Student Perceptions of Learning,We are engaged with conducting research that explores the promising teaching practices for teaching linguistically and culturally diverse international students by identifying the teaching practices and individual instructor characteristics that have high levels of international student satisfaction and student learning. In phase 1; we used a mixed-methods research design to focus generally on the connection between teaching practices and student satisfaction; including variability by country of origin; study level; program of study; study time; study stage; and age. In phase 2; we used a qualitative research design to investigate the difference between STEM and non-STEM students with regard to the connection between teaching practices and student satisfaction. In phase 3; we used a qualitative research design to examine the attitudes of online international students with regard to teaching practices and student satisfaction. This led us to sponsor a research symposium; edit a special edition journal; and to publish the IGI Global book; Handbook of Research on Teaching Strategies for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse International Students (DOI: 10.4018/978-1-7998-8921-2).

32239,Artificial Intelligence for Industry 4.0,Corporations are increasingly interested in adopting Industry 4.0 in their production and services because of its ability to boost their competitive strength in global markets. The provision of individualized mass customization in Industry 4.0; on the one hand; satisfies personalized needs; quality and cost constraints and; on the other hand; enables the businesses to respond to the environmental; energy and other global challenges. In a manufacturing process; this combination requires a smart factory with remarkably flexible operation of not only machines but also self-conscious products to swiftly respond to change in every step of the process. The smart factory is composed of smart machines and product components; communication networks; cloud services; and control terminals. These comprise the hardware for computation; communication and control (3Cs) of smart production; but the autonomy of production in the smart factory still requires the ability to analyze a great volume of data and determine the best possible actions in real time. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the brain of the smart factory and serves two main purposes. First; it filters; analyzes and ultimately learns from the big data mostly generated through machine to machine (M2M) communication in the smart factory. Big data analytics can; for example; be used for digital twins or predictive manufacturing to provide early warning and prevent catastrophic failures. Second; AI provides reasoning and autonomous decision making tools that have the ability to analyze and adapt to new situations. This is not a trivial task since decisions have to be made based on uncertain information and imperfect data.

32240,Emerging topics and technologies in robotics and unmanned systems,For a few decades; the diversity of robotics technology and its applications has continuously expanded at an increasing rate mainly with respect to the environments where their actions take place. Robots’ task space is no longer limited to a designated; well-defined and structured environment. Modern applications require that a robot move and operate safely in an unknown environment shared by static and moving objects. Recently; major breakthroughs including active and semantic SLAM algorithms; robust object detection and tracking techniques using machine learning; and finally feedback motion planning methods in conjunction with differential constraints and sampling based planning have shown potential research directions in this field. However; there is still vast research opportunities for improvement and further research to relax the underlying assumptions (typically made to approximate quasi-static processes); and alleviate the shortcomings of these implementations often limited by the high computational cost; low dimensional analyses; sensing uncertainty and a need for additional behavioral information about the surrounding objects. The core research on autonomy of multiple robots in dynamic environment planned in the ACIS laboratory relies on the development of a versatile and effective testing platform for object identification and tracking; localization and mapping and motion planning and execution of a distributed network of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles (UGVs and UAVs). The testing platform will be capable of coordinating the autonomous navigation of UAVs with the ground vehicles to maintain a certain formation while avoiding the obstacles in the environment. In addition; this platform will be used as a test bed for multi-robot distributed task allocation in real world applications such as autonomous firefighting systems.

We have demonstrated that biocarbon can displace up to 40% of plastic in composites. This reduces the demand for virgin plastics as well as the composite weight by substituting commonly used fillers of higher densities. The breakthrough technology enables ecofriendly lightweight biocomposites to be used in a wide range of applications including packaging and automotive parts. The research project will explore innovative strategies of utilization of recycled plastics biocarbon for sustainable composite materials.

32245,Isolation of natural and “unnatural” anticancer compound,Approximately 60% of drugs originate from or are inspired by plant natural products. However; the potential of many of these compounds is not fully realized as they could only be produced in low amounts by a small number of slow-growing or endangered species; and/or by expensive chemical synthesis. Alkaloids are widely used for the treatment of various types of cancers but in some cases are not ideal for treatment owing to their low solubility; side effects; and drug resistance.

32247,How neural stem cells build, maintain and regenerate the brain,In my lab we study how adult neural stem cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) produce oligodendrocytes; brain cells that produce myelin. We ask how neural stem cells and OPCs contribute to the disease and how can they be pharmacologically mobilized for enhanced oligodendrocyte replacement and remyelination. For MS disease mechanisms; we ask how neural stem cells interact with microglia (brain immune cells); and affect both brain development and demyelination later in life (PMID: 36937181). For pro-regenerative approaches in MS; we ask how neuronally secreted molecules regulate myelination and oligodendrocyte (re)generation from neural stem cells and OPCs (PMIDs: 31629772; 36608690; 35293825; 34270934).

32248,Nanotechnology with DNA origami,This cutting edge; interdisciplinary project requires the student to design two-dimensional and three-dimensional DNA structures. The exact shape will depend on the application. For the ‘synthetic leaves’ project; these structures will be discs; spheres; and octahedrons. These structures will be constructed using DNA origami techniques and characterized using a variety of biochemical methods and ultra-sensitive atomic-force and electron microscopes that can resolve nanometer-sized shapes. Once accomplished; we will combine dyes that intercalate (bind between DNA base pairs) or bind in the major groove of DNA to these folded DNA structures. This will need further characterization to ascertain the amount and position of dye binding. To test the efficiency of these new complexes; we will measure their absorption and energy-transfer properties using time-resolved spectroscopy approaches. Energy transfer between dyes is very fast; occurring in one billionth of a second or faster. We will use cutting-edge ultrafast laser techniques combined with non-linear optical methods to measure and analyze this process. This would not only help us move one step closer to making a synthetic leaf light-harvester; but would also help researchers understand the fundamental energy transfer and molecular interaction parameters that are essential for the creation of new materials. Only a handful of research groups in the world work on these research topics and the student will become proficient in all these laboratory techniques; while gaining transferable skills; such as improved written and oral communication; effective teamworking; and advanced critical thinking; which would be an asset in any academic endeavor or future career.

32256,Coordination of mitotic exit by the BUB1/BUBR1 complex,The signalling mechanism that prevents incorrect segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This pathway detects the absence of interactions between dividing chromosomes and the mitotic spindle; the large cytoskeletal structure responsible for chromosome movement to new daughter cells. The final step of the SAC pathway is the assembly of a complex called the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) which functions like a “stop” signal; delaying cell division until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle. The SAC and MCC are therefore crucial mechanisms of maintaining genome integrity during cell division. Once chromosome-spindle attachments are correctly formed; the MCC must be disassembled to allow completion of mitosis. A major step in MCC formation is the interaction between two related proteins BUB1 and BUBR1. Although we understand how this complex is formed; little is known about how this complex is disassembled to permit exit from mitosis. In this project; we will explore this mechanism of interaction between BUB1 and BUBR1 and determine how this complex contributes to the accurate segregation of chromosomes. The project is divided into 3 aims: 1. Determine how the BUB1-BUBR1 interaction is regulated by phosphorylation; a post-translational mechanism essential for mitosis. This will be performed using biochemical approaches/tools including phosphorylation assays; chemical inhibitors; immunoprecipitation and western blotting. 2. Identify the enzymes (kinases) responsible for the BUB1-BUBR1 interaction and the sites of phosphorylation involved. This will be done using mass-spectrometry approaches. 3. Define the importance of the phosphorylation sites for the fidelity of chromosome segregation. This will be done by imaging approaches including high resolution; and live-cell imaging techniques. This project will be performed under the guidance of the supervisor and a senior graduate student.

32257,Towards understanding the role of kinetochore aberrations in breast cancer progression,Kinetochore Project description: Breast Cancer (BC) is a highly heterogenous disease with some cases being associated with slow growth and excellent prognosis whilst other tumors exhibit a highly aggressive clinical course. Using a cell culture model of breast cancer progression; we have identified using genomic approaches and cell biology approaches that cells from a BC ‘continuum’ series that mimics the different stages of cancer progression exhibit a stage-dependent increase in structural and numerical centrosome defects. In human cells; centrosomes form the poles of the mitotic spindle which is responsible for binding to and segregating chromosomes. Consequently; dividing cells in this series exhibit chromosome segregation defects that increase with disease progression. Using genomic methods; we have found that some of the most effected cell cycle genes are those implicated in kinetochore maintenance. In this project; we will use cell biology and molecular biology techniques to determine the contribution of kinetochore defects to BC progression. Three aims are envisioned to test this hypothesis: AIM1: To detail mitotic defects leading to chromosome missegregation in the BC continuum model. We will use high resolution microscopy; live-cell imaging and image analysis to observe; quantify and catalog the mitotic defects in the BC series. AIM2: To characterize kinetochore defects in the BC continuum and correlate them with disease stage using similar approaches as aim1. AIM3: Identify changes in expression of mitotic genes from the BC series human transcriptome arrays (HTA) and correlate to the identified mitotic defects. Our collaborators have generated genome-wide transcriptome of the different stages of BC from the continuum series as well as patient samples. We will use this dataset to identify mitotic genes that are implicated in BC initiation and progression. All the assays are established in the Elowe lab and all necessary equipment and reagents are readily available.,SabineElowe,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,- Good communication skills. - Enthusiasm; ambition; and interest in the project. - Willingness to work in a team-environment. - Previous laboratory experience is an asset but not necessary.,None
32258,Immune Cells Classification Using Deep Neural Networks,Cells of the innate immune system form a critical part of our bodies defense against pathogens; parasites; and cancer. Phagocytes consume these enemies by engulfing (‘eating’) the target in a process called phagocytosis. Being able to predict how an immune cell makes the decision ‘to eat; or not to eat’ is critical for our understanding of how to engineer the immune system in cutting edge immunotherapies. This interdisciplinary project will combine themes from engineering; biology; and artificial intelligence to address this challenge.

32259,Ecological stoichiometry modelling,Carbon (C); nitrogen (N); and phosphorus (P) are vital constituents in biomass: C supplies energy to cells; N is essential to build proteins; and P is an essential component of nucleic acids. The scarcity of any of these elements can severely restrict organism and population growth.

32260,Analytic Methods in Extremal Combinatorics,One of the most influential recent developments in combinatorics is the emergence of a "limit theory" for combinatorial structures. The importance of combinatorial limit theory was recently recognized by the awarding of the Abel Prize to Lovasz (one of its inventors) in 2022. The basic idea behind it is that large combinatorial objects can be viewed as discrete approximation of a rich analytic structure (such as a measurable function). This viewpoint has led to new analytic tools for attacking important open problems in extremal combinatorics. The focus of this project will be on using methods from analysis; probability theory; optimization and information theory to attack problems in extremal combinatorics with connections to other areas. One focus will be on proving correlation inequalities for subgraph densities in large dense graphs related to the famous Sidorenko Conjecture on densities of bipartite graphs. These results are likely to shed light on the important problem of maximizing/minimizing partition functions in statistical physics. Another focus will be on finding new quantitative measures of independence for tuples of random variables. Through working on these projects; the student will be introduced to cutting-edge techniques in the area; such as the flag algebra method; applications of ideas from variational calculus and approaches based on analyzing the entropy of a random variable.,JonathanNoel,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,A strong background in combinatorics and graph theory would be very valuable.

32263,Multi-armed Bandit Models for RIS-aided Wireless Communications Systems,Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is one of the reinforcement learning problems that can be utilized for decision-making in which an agent tries to select actions (arms) to achieve the best cumulative reward in the long term. Many algorithms have been developed for MAB problems. One of the simplest of these is Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In this algorithm; Hoeffding's Inequality calculates the upper bound on the set of variables to have a better exploration-exploitation trade-off. This algorithm can be used to solve many wireless communications problems. As an example; beam alignment and tracking is an important problem in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless systems. Assume that there are several users in the network; each user has some features; and the agent should find the best beam angle for each user. So one can use MAB algorithms to blindly detect the beam directions. In other words; The approach should apply the exploration-exploitation trade-off for the selection of beam angles as fast as possible to outperform the search-based beam alignment methods; also the algorithm should learn the preferences of users by using the user's context information in bandits; and this type of algorithm is called Contextual Bandits. This research project deals with developing con textual bandit algorithms for beam alignment in RIS-aided wireless systems.,EkramHossain,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge on communications systems and wireless communications; and experience on Matlab programming.,None
32264,Multi-armed Bandits for Integrated Communications and Sensing,Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is one of the reinforcement learning problems that can be utilized for decision-making in which an agent tries to select actions (arms) to achieve the best cumulative reward in the long term. Many algorithms have been developed for MAB problems. One of the simplest of these is Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) which can be used to solve many wireless communications problems. As an example; integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is an emerging technology for future 6G wireless systems. The basic principle of ISAC is to unify sensing and communications operations on a single hardware while using the same spectral resources. A special case of ISAC technology is joint radar-communications (JRC) system where sensing is performed by a radar. The research project will deal with developing algorithms for energy-efficient JRC systems under practical system constraints (e.g.; uncertainty in channel state).,EkramHossain,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge on communications systems and wireless communications; and experience on Matlab programming.,None
32265,Multi-armed Bandits for Efficient Federated Learning,Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is one of the reinforcement learning problems that can be utilized for decision-making in which an agent tries to select actions (arms) to achieve the best cumulative reward in the long term. Many algorithms have been developed for MAB problems. One of the simplest of these is Upper Confidence Bound (UCB); which can be used to solve many wireless communications problems. As an example; consider a federated learning (FL) scenario in a network consisting of a base station (BS) (server) and a set of users (also referred to as clients). The server and the clients collaborate in training a shared model without sharing the clients' local data. In this learning algorithm; it is common to select a subset of clients to participate in the learning process rather using all of them for two main reasons. First; the number of communication channels between the clients and the server is limited and only a subset of clients would be able to communicate with the server. In addition to that; some clients can experience very long delay which; if included in the learning process; would slow the convergence of the algorithm. Note here that the delay experienced by each client is random due to the randomness in the channel conditions. The aim of this project to select a subset of clients that minimizes the FL convergence time without any prior knowledge about the state of the wireless channels or the clients. The proposed solution is based on combinatorial MABs where the clients represent the arms; and the learner; represented by the server; aims to find the super arm (subset of clients) that minimize the FL delay.,EkramHossain,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,Basic knowledge on communications systems and wireless communications; and experience on Matlab programming,None
32266,Historical Injustices in Higher Education Institutions,This is a SSHRC funded research project that focuses on the involvement of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in historical injustices. Despite the important role organizations play in cases of historical injustice; we still know little about how they produce; reproduce; and; eventually; also disrupt social injustices. On the one hand; organization scholars' interest in historical injustices is still recent and undeveloped. On the other hand; scholars of historical injustice have been inattentive to organizations supporting intergenerational harm. Further; both groups have particularly overlooked how organizations such as HEIs contribute to historical injustices. This project aims to fill the aforementioned gap by developing theory on how organizations promote the production; reproduction; and disruption of lasting social injustices such as racism; economic inequality; and class discrimination. We focus on how HEIs contribute with historical injustices because they are highly trusted organizations that provide institutional templates and set ethical standards for other public and private organizations. We also hope to identify strategies HEIs can employ to prevent continued structural injustices; reconcile past actions with inflicted harm; and disrupt legacies of wrongdoing. We aim to develop comparative case-study research of HEIs in three different countries. 1. Racial injustice in the United States. How do HEIs with ties to slavery (e.g.; Brown; Harvard) respond when challenged about their legacies of wrongdoing? 2. Ethnic injustice in Canada. How are Canadian HEIs indigenizing following the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action? 3. Class injustice in Brazil. How did a small group of HEIs manage to motivate the creation of a national affirmative policy for the democratization of higher education?,DiegoCoraiola,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-01,I hope to have two students working on this project simultaneously.

32268,Nanoparticle Enhanced Oils for New Fuel-Efficient Automotive Applications,Newly developed "conventional" automobiles will either contain stop-start engines or will rely on hybrid technology to reduce fuel consumption. These new technologies present issues for conventional oils; which typically need to operate at higher temperatures than would be achieved when the combustion engine runs intermittently. Thus; lower viscosity oils must be developed to ensure the same lubrication and wear performance of the oil in the internal combustion engine. Nanoparticles are seen as one solution to this problem; as their addition to conventional and synthetic oils has been observed to have beneficial lubrication and wear properties. Further enhancement of the lubrication and wear properties have been observed when these particles are coated in two-dimensional lubricants; such as graphene or boron nitride. However; in all cases; the nanoparticles need to be chemically capped such that they dissolve into the base stock oil. This project will examine the influence of polymer nanoparticles on the friction performance of conventional oils to determine the benefit of such particles to the lubrication performance of the oils; the fluid mechanical properties of the oil; and the wear performance. Comparison between conventional polymer nanoparticles and those covered in two-dimensional lubricants will be conducted; to determine any synergistic improvements that can be achieved in the friction and wear properties of the oil; as well as the ability for the two-dimensional films to improve the dissolution of the nanoparticles in the oil base stock. A particular emphasis on understanding the physical lubrication and wear mechanisms that are changed or altered through nanoparticle enhanced lubricants.,PhilipEgberts,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,The student should be highly motivated and interested in learning experimental techniques.

32273,Optimization of Vibro-Compaction for Improved Green Anode Density for Aluminum Production: A fluid mechanics analysis,Canada is home to many premier aluminum smelters; including leading companies such as Alcoa; Rio Tinto Alcan; and Alouette; which rank among the largest of their kind globally. Despite the significance of aluminum production to the region; it is a complex process that incurs substantial energy consumption and environmental consequences. To mitigate these challenges; we will embark on an extensive study aimed at examining the effect of vibro-compaction on the density of green anodes used in aluminum production. Green anodes are typically fabricated by compacting anode paste in a mold through vibro-compaction. Nonetheless; this method remains only partially understood and is known to generate density gradients within the anodes that compromise cell performance. Previous research in this area is limited by several factors; including the lack of clarity in physical parameters and limited applicability to a range of anode paste recipes. Our study seeks to address these shortcomings by characterizing the mechanical behavior of anode paste during vibro-compaction at high frequencies (e.g.; 25 Hz) in a laboratory-scaled setting. We will study the process from a fluid mechanics perspective. To achieve our goal; we will employ a suite of advanced techniques including ultra-high-speed and laser imaging; tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV); Ultrasound Doppler velocimetry (UDV); and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to analyze the anode-forming process. These techniques will enable us to generate more uniform density distributions within green anodes and provide insights into the impact of anode geometry and recipe on the mechanical behavior of anode paste during vibro-compaction. Ultimately; the findings of this study will be used to optimize the process and reduce the environmental impact of aluminum production in Quebec.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,* The student must be familiar with fluid mechanics and understand its concepts. * The student must be also willing to perform laboratory experiments. * The student needs to have a high GPA. * The student needs to be hard-working person. * The student needs to be passionate about research.,None
32274,Slippery When Yielded: Investigating the Flow of Yield Stress Fluids over Superhydrophobic Surfaces,Yield stress fluids are a class of non-Newtonian fluids that exhibit a threshold for applied stress; known as the yield stress. When the applied stress exceeds the yield stress; the material behaves like a viscous fluid; while below the yield stress; the material acts as a rigid solid. Examples of yield stress fluids include waxy crude oil; foamed cement and cement slurry; food products like chocolate cream and jam; and cosmetic products such as moisturizing cream. Superhydrophobic surfaces are surfaces that exhibit exceptional slipperiness when liquid flows over them; offering a range of new applications such as drag reduction and flow handling in microfluidic devices. The flow of yield stress fluids over superhydrophobic surfaces has current applications in the synthesis of biofluids in microfluidic devices and potential applications such as drag reduction for the flow of waxy crude oil through pipelines. This internship project aims to investigate the flow of yield stress fluids in channels lined with superhydrophobic walls. The primary objective is to characterize the slip property of the flow in contact with the wall; represented by a slip length. The flow configuration will be a pressure-driven channel flow; also known as Poiseuille flow; of yield stress fluids with superhydrophobic walls. The Herschel-Bulkley model will be used to model the yield stress fluid; and micro-scale groovy patterns will be created on the wall surface to fabricate the superhydrophobic wall; allowing the fluid to slip. Despite the potential for practical applications; there is a lack of research on the slip characteristics of non-Newtonian fluids over superhydrophobic surfaces. This project aims to fill this gap by employing mathematical modeling; numerical simulations; and experimental measurements to investigate the slip characteristics for the flow of yield stress fluids over superhydrophobic surfaces.,Seyed MohammadTaghavi,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-01,,None
32275,Novel lithium extraction processes from spodumene,Lithium extraction from spodumene concentrates is a complex process; which has remained largely unchanged since its inception in the 1940s. Nowadays; this process involves an energy-intensive flash-calcinination step of the spodumene concentrate to transform it from the alpha to the beta phase; prior to sulfuric acid baking. This flash-calcining typically uses fossil fuels (such as natural gas) as the source of energy; resulting in a significant carbon footprint for the production of the lithium hydroxyde used in Li-ion battery manufacturing. This project intends to test out spodumene extraction processes which do not involve flash-calcining of the spodumene; as a way to reduce the energy consumption. This may include: carbonate roasting of the spodumene; pressure leaching and reactions with alkali bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These methods typically present slower kinetics; which nonetheless must be studied in order to assess their applicability. As such; the project will involve: - a brief literature review highlighting the potential routes for Li extraction without flash-calcining and showing how they can be tested in the laboratory; - development of an apparatus and procedure for such Li extraction tests; - execution of tests and analyses allowing performance assessments; - establishing the feasibility (or not) of the proposed approaches and suggesting further research paths.,Jean-FrancoisBoulanger,Québec,Université du Québec en Abitibi–Temiscamingue,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Candidates self-identifying as women or from minority groups underrepresented in sciences; with a curriculum in chemical or metallurgical engineering or chemistry are strongly encouraged to apply; especially those with some knowledge of extractive metallurgy (hydrometallurgy) or mineral processing.

32277,Long-term responses of streams and riparian areas to forest harvesting,Forest harvesting around streams can have large; direct impacts. Some of the alterations to important processes; such as the amount of light reaching a stream; can recover quickly. However; other changes may take decades to recover; such as physical structure; including the amount of large wood in stream channels. Other changes to the forest composition (affecting organic matter inputs and chemistry) may also be slow to change. Most ecological studies consider only the short-term responses; usually at most a few years. In this study we have 15 stream catchments that had different magnitudes of forest harvesting almost 25 years ago; and we are considering how the intensity of harvesting affects recovery of biological communities and organic matter dynamics. This is a unique opportunity to study the long-term recovery of streams and their riparian areas from different amounts of protection from forest harvesting.,Dr. John S.RICHARDSON,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,Undergraduate courses in ecology; and preferably freshwater ecology; will be important.

32278,Quantum computing for quantum chemistry,The electronic structure problem is the key for material and drug designs. Solving it accurately using quantum mechanical methods on regular classical computers leads to algorithms whose execution time grows exponentially with the system size. Emerging technology of quantum computing recently provided a new hope to solve this problem efficiently. Yet; the new quantum hardware requires new algorithms. Currently; there are two main algorithmic frameworks for solving the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer: 1) quantum phase estimation (QPE) and 2) variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). None of these approaches provide a solution to the problem that is competitive with well-developed numerical techniques on a classical computer. Thus; none of them has yet demonstrated quantum advantage (superiority of quantum computing over its classical counterpart) for the electronic structure problem. In this project we will be developing new alternative frameworks for solving the problem on a quantum computer that will address main deficiencies of the previous techniques. The main goal is to develop a framework demonstrating quantum advantage in quantum chemistry problems.,ArturIzmaylov,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Familiarity with quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry methods.,None
32279,Biodiversity of headwater streams,Biodiversity of invertebrate animals in small streams and their riparian areas is very high. The reasons for this high biodiversity and its maintenance are not known; but we are testing for the patterns and experimentally manipulating habitats to see if the abiotic factors that are associated with high biodiversity in these areas can be protected. In particular we are studying the contributions of small forested streams and ponds that are disproportionately impacted by climate change and land-use changes. We know relatively little about what maintains the freshwater biodiversity therein; because these areas are not directly used for human activities; including fishing and water withdrawals. This project will combine field surveys; transplant experiments and mesocosm experiments to address the diversity in these sites and their range of tolerance for changes in their environments related to climate change. This work provides for basic understanding of how these ecosystems function; the biodiversity they support; and how these systems respond to changes. This will contribute to practical outcomes; such as identifying features that need to be protected to sustain resilient and functioning freshwater ecosystems in the face of global changes.,Dr. John S.RICHARDSON,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,A student with a keen interest in ecology; and especially an interest in biodiversity and ecosystem function.

32285,Advancing Ink Formulations for Fabricating Durable Electrodes,The high cost of clean energy devices; such as hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers; are driven by the use of rare-earth metals; such as platinum; ruthenium; and iridium. These metal-based electrodes are conventionally fabricated through coating a catalyst ink on a substrate via blade coating or spray coating. The catalyst ink is formulated by mixing specific amounts of catalyst; alcohols; binders; and water; and the ink properties are highly sensitive to mixing ratios and parameters. Non-ideal ink formulation leads to formation of cracks during electrode deposition; which leads to poor durability of the clean energy devices. Thus; understanding the relationship between the ink formulation parameters and the resulting electrode property is critical to creating efficient and durable clean energy devices. In this project; we will investigate how the ink recipe affects crack formation after ink deposition. We will vary the volume ratio of alcohol and water; binder content; and electrode thickness; and we will characterize the resulting ink properties. The inks will be deposited to a substrate to form an electrode; which we will image under an optical microscope. We will use image analysis techniques to characterize the crack morphology and density.

32295,Discovering the secrets of axenic boxes to study plant-microbe interactions,As we face an acceleration of global change: increasing temperatures; humidity and CO2 levels accompanied with higher demands on land for mining and agriculture; there is a need to improve our understanding of plant-microbe interactions. To isolate causal mechanisms of interactions between host and microbes; researchers have sought to work with axenic plant hosts: plants that would grow devoid of any microorganism. This task is proving to be challenging; has fungal and bacterial spores get everywhere; such as viruses. The field of plant-microbe interactions has seen the development of axenic boxes that are meant to allow researchers to grow Arabidopsis thaliana without any microorganisms. This system is currently being used although some environmental components are far from representative of real-life environment (>99% humidity); thus favouring pathogens and eliciting a weird plant phenotype (smaller plants).

In your contribution to this projection; you will have the opportunity to grow A. thaliana in our novel axenic system and control specific abiotic (humidity; heat; nutrients) and biotic (select specific bacterial or fungal strains to be inoculated) conditions to measure their impact on the plant growth; survival; and immune system.

32297,Community translation and interpretation services,Community translation (also known as public service translation) is under-researched. It is also poorly recognized as a profession.

We locate and explore links between these aspects; combining the team members’ different multidisciplinary approaches and methods to understand the real-world work of fairy tales envisioning justice in valuable new ways. Fairy tales include literary stories by an individual author (e.g. Hans Christian Andersen) and traditional narratives--international; historical Märchen or tales of magic. Both types intertextually and intermedially relate to earlier and later manifestations; translated into different languages; cultural contexts; forms; and media. Influencing analyses well beyond literary studies; and filtered through tale collectors from at least the second century AD; Märchen; like literary fairy tales; deal with the supernatural--magical adversaries; tasks; helpers; objects; power; and knowledge. Our work has two phases: Phase 1: Justice in intertextual; intermedial fairy-tales and wonder: embodiments; and Phase 2: Justice in intertextual; intermedial fairy-tales and wonder: transnational; transcultural chronotopes. We examine how creators and audiences employ fairy-tale structures and motifs as social texts (implicated in specific cultural contexts) to tell the same (or different) stories. Key scholars like Maria Tatar; Marina Warner; and team member Jack Zipes argue; based on historical and current fairy tales; that the genre expresses realistic sociocultural concerns and fears; marshals a symbolic vocabulary of imagination and possibility; and demonstrates both social constraints like patriarchy and classism and resistance to and triumph over these limitations. Fairy tales' serious societal work of imagining just alternatives calls for serious scholarly attention.,PaulineGreenhill,Manitoba,University of Winnipeg,English,2024-05-01,We seek a student with some background in gender; queer; anti-racist; de-colonial studies and perspectives; with interest in and enthusiasm for fairy-tale media.

Ideally; knowledge and facility in languages other than English would be a great asset.,None
32305,BRM-related gene expression patterns in human abdominal cavity tumors s,The protein product of the BRM gene is a subunit of an important protein complex called SWI/SNF. This complex is involved in remodeling our DNA molecule and influencing gene expression. There are many published studies linking abnormalities of this gene to cancer; including risk of developing cancer (for example; lung cancer) and patient outcomes (for example; death from cancer). We previously examined this gene in colorectal cancer and lung adenocarcinomas. In this study; we aim to examine the gene expression levels of this gene in human tumors – preferably in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for the gastrointestinal cancers (e.g. stomach; esophageal) and other cancers originating in the abdominal cavity. We hypothesize that the expression levels of BRM differ between tumors of different patients. We also hypothesize that this difference is associated with different expression levels of other genes and biological pathways. By analyzing the differentially expressed genes/biological pathways and the disease and patient characteristics; we hope to find out how BRM expression levels are linked to this disease biologically. Cancer is a common disease. Understanding the relation of BRM to human cancers may create exciting opportunities for future studies. Since the BRM gene is linked to multiple human cancers; we expect that this study may also significantly contribute to our understanding of many cancers at the biological level. We can focus on cancers with the largest sample sizes in the TCGA dataset; such as stomach and esophageal cancers; but other abdominal cancer sites are also great candidates.,SevtapSavas,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-01,,None
32306,Palmitoylation-dependent protein trafficking in neurons,Neurons are the basic working unit of the brain. They transmit information from other neurons or sensory organs to downstream neurons or muscles and; in doing so; control learning and memory; movement; and other complex tasks. Neurons are large; complex cells with long projections; called axons; that send electrical impulses to other neurons they are connected to. Ion channels are proteins that open and close to form pores in the outer fatty layer of the neuron known as the membrane. They initiate and carry electrical impulses along axons and must be delivered to specific locations in the axon to ensure normal brain function. These ion channels are modified with a sticky tag in a process called palmitoylation. The sticky tag acts like a postal code that helps other cell machinery transport the ion channels to the correct location. We hypothesize that palmitoylation directs ion channels and retains them at the sites where electrical impulses are generated. This project seeks to understand how palmitoylation regulates ion channel and organelle trafficking and targeting in neurons. The student will get to clone palmitoylated neuronal proteins and expressing them in mammalian cells grown in culture to identify their sites of palmitoylation and the enzymes that regulate this process. The student will then get to express fluorescently tagged wild type ('normal') palmitoylated proteins and their palmitoylation deficient counterparts in neurons and monitor their localization. This project will provide the student with a broad array of laboratory skills in molecular biology; cell biology; and biochemistry. This work will provide new insights into the regulation of transport of cellular components in brain cells and a better understanding of their normal function. Our findings will also have important implications for understanding disorders such as epilepsy; where there is too much brain electrical activity.,ShaunSanders,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-13,The student will have completed at least two years of a neuroscience; biology; or related undergraduate program and will have taken classes on cell biology; neuroscience; and molecular biology.

32309,Cellular foci of the androgen receptor and their role in prostate cancer,The androgen receptor (AR) remains the main target for Prostate Cancer (PCa) treatment. Unfortunately; most AR antagonists fail due to resistance mechanisms; highlighting the need for new approaches to target this receptor. Lately; condensates of transcription factors and coactivators have been shown to form at super-enhancers (SEs); which are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble the transcriptional apparatus at high density in order to enable the robust expression of genes that play an important role in defining cell identity. It has been established that cancer cells; including PCa; rely on abnormal transcription programs driven by SEs. Our preliminary data demonstrate that AR-rich condensates form in PCa models upon androgen stimulation and control its transcriptional activity. In this study; we will use a multi-disciplinary approach including biophysics; genomics; biochemistry; and cell biology to characterize the biophysical properties of AR condensates; to identify sequence features and partners essential for this mechanism; and to elucidate the effect of cancerous environment on AR condensate formation at SE sites. This research study will help to identify novel ways of targeting AR activity downstream of androgen activation and DNA binding.,NadaLallous,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The project involves cell culture; protein biochemistry; and microscopy skills.

32313,Dynamic Stability of Structures with Semi-Rigid Connections,Neglect or poor understanding of the effect of dynamic (time-varying) loads on the resonance and stability aspects of structural design may cause loss of property or other disasters. For example; the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed in 1940 due to aerodynamic instability; a pillar rockburst was induced in underground excavations at the Musselwhite mine in Ontario in 2015; and piled tanks collapsed after the 2017 Mexico earthquake. How to accurately and effectively assess and predict such failures is a key issue in civil engineering. Dynamic loadings arising from earthquakes; winds; or blasting often consist of forces with various wave shapes and would appear as one of the coefficients in the governing equations of motion. Such systems are said to be parametrically excited and the associated instability is called parametric resonance. Parametric resonance is more dangerous than ordinary resonance—characterized by linear growth of the response amplitude—because it is characterized by exponential growth of the response amplitude; even in the presence of damping. The objective of the project is to theoretically and experimentally study parametric resonance and dynamic stability of structures subjected to dynamic loads with various waveforms; with applications to civil and mining engineering. We will develop efficient analytical and numerical methods to determine dynamic stability of various systems.

An advanced algorithm will be proposed to solve the differential equation. Therefore; fundamental analytical and experimental skills would be a requirement.,None
32314,Landslides investigation, risk evaluation and mitigation in Northwestern Ontario, Canada,The Nipigon river area in Ontario; Canada is in a dynamic geological zone often affected by soil slope failures; landslides; debris flows and rock falls. A typical example is the massive landslide that occurred in the 1990s; which involved an estimated 300;000 cubic meters of soil and extended almost 350m inshore with a maximum width of approximately 290m. It caused significant economic loss and environmental impacts. Since then; progressive landslides along the river banks have occurred from time to time. The overall purpose of the research project is to conduct in-situ soil investigations; to perform laboratory testing; and to carry out risk analysis of landslides in the Nipigon river area. We will obtain representative soil samples from bored holes of all relevant layers. By using the advanced triaxial test apparatus in the soil lab of Lakehead University; triaxial shear tests will be conducted to determine a series of soil shear strength parameters. This data will be used to develop new entropy-based probabilistic models in the risk and stability analysis of geotechnical slopes. Measures to mitigate the landslide hazard will be proposed. This project will carefully study the soil properties and assess the stability of natural and artificial slopes such that we have a good engineering practice and society lives in a safe environment.

32317,Unpacking the Interdisciplinary Commitment of the Team and Disruption of their Research,Work in knowledge-intensive and innovative organizations is often structured around teams. Organizing teams to increase the likelihood of disruption poses a significant challenge. In organizational research; disruption occurs when smaller firms challenge established incumbent firms; which focus on sustaining innovations and improving products and services for their most profitable customers (Christensen; 1997; Christensen; Raynor; & McDonald; 2015). Similarly; scholarly work that is disruptive broadens academic perspectives and eclipses previous studies that build on existing conceptualizations; whereas studies that are developing incrementally enhance or reinforce past research directions (Funk & Owen-Smith; 2017). The effects different team-level organizational arrangements - their size; mix of skills and knowledge; and diversity– have on disruptive outcomes are rarely tested (Haeussler & Sauermann; 2020; Wang et al.; 2017; 2018). We begin to tease out how differences in the organization of tens of thousands of scientific teams working in the full range of science and social science research fields influence the type of research that they produce. We aim to answer the research questions: Where does disruptive research come from? How does the interdisciplinarity commitment of the team impact the disruptiveness of their research? While there is substantive evidence that scientists who are engaged in interdisciplinary research benefit from higher visibility and impact (Leahey et al.; 2017; Uzzi et al.; 2013) and facilitate their researcher’s engagement in technology transfer (D’Este et al.; 2019); less is known about whether a team’s interdisciplinarity impacts disruptiveness of the team's research work. Interdisciplinarity is often considered valuable in itself because: (a) it increases variety in research; potentially counteracting the increasing tendency toward specialization in many fields (Cedrini & Fontana; 2017); and (b) it promotes the broad search for adequate solutions to various scientific and social problems (Rafols et al.; 2012; Wang et al.; 2017).,NazhaGali,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-07-01,The student needs to know SQL and to deal with big data and in using Python.,None
32318,Research on Self-Tapping-Wood-Screws,There is an acute need for research to develop value-added applications for wood and wood products such as Cross-Laminated-Timber (CLT). One prominent target area are mid- and high-rise structures. In seismic regions; such as Western Canada; connectors must provide ductility to otherwise rigid building systems composed of CLT panels. There are a number of options available; one of the most promising are Self-Tapping-Screws (STS). The objective of the project is to develop design guidance for CLT assemblies connected by STS for large structures; considering seismic loads. Experimental; numerical and analytical work on the material; component and system levels will be combined to achieve this objective. The project can contribute to increasing the market share of wood products in the North American construction sector; and thus; the project contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of structures.,ThomasTannert,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,The applicants should study for a degree in either civil engineering; wood science; or mechanical engineering.

32319,Experimental investigations on reinforced timber elements,The last decades were marked by a significant widening in the range of structural application of timber. There is; however; a growing need for the maintenance and upgrading of existing buildings for economic; environmental; historical and social concerns. Worldwide; a large proportion of the existing building stock is more than 50 years old; many of these buildings need to be adapted for more sophisticated present and future requirements. The need for structural reinforcement of timber buildings may become necessary from motivations such as change of use; changes in regulatory specifications; interventions to increase seismic resistance; deterioration due to poor maintenance; or exceptional damaging incidents. One method to reinforce timber is adding elements to increase strength and stiffness; the options range from mechanical fasteners like glued-in rods and self-tapping screws; adhesive systems; steel straps and plates; ever more widely fibre-reinforced polymers; and most recently nanotechnology. In the project; timber elements with mechanical reinforcements will be investigated considering a wide range of parameters. A statistically significant number of specimens will be tested; herein 10 for each parameter combination. The load-deformation behaviour in a selected subset of tests will be monitored; with special focus close and beyond failure.,ThomasTannert,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,The intern should have a background in either civil engineering; materials science; or a related field.

32321,Deep learning-based Control,Batteries are flexible assets that can help modulate power loads at multiple timescales. From the battery perspective; determining an optimal amount of frequency regulation (FR) capacity to be offered in the market is a non-trivial task. This involves a complex multiscale decision-making problem to be solved every hour; in which the stationary battery systems need to exploit high-fidelity models to trade-off short-term economic incentives provided by frequency regulation markets and long-term degradation effects. The computational complexity of solving this large-scale nonlinear optimization problem is challenging for online implementation. To address the challenges; we aim to replace the online optimization with a well-trained neural network controller. We will first generate a big data set by solving many optimization problems off-line in parallel with different signals. Then a deep learning model can be trained to predict the optimal control actions from states and disturbances. The student will develop in-depth knowledge of nonlinear optimization; mathematical analysis; scientific programming; and deep learning. Successful completion of the project will lead to a publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.,YankaiCao,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-15,mathematical analysis; scientific programming,None
32322,A Machine Learning Approach to Optimize a New Biomass-Based Carbon Removal Processes,A promising way to capture/remove carbon profitably is through the conversion of crop/forest residues (biomass) into bioproducts such as biochar-based fertilizers and chemicals. However; most rural communities are shut out from this bio-based economy; because their crop/forest residues are often loose; wet; bulky; and too expensive to transport to a centralized place. These non-merchantable residues are often burned in open air; leading to pollution and exacerbated wildfires. We have implemented a new class of small-scale; low-cost; decentralized bioconversion systems. These can be latched onto the back of tractors/pick-up trucks to deploy to remote; hard-to-access communities to locally upgrade/densify the residues into locally valuable chemicals; biofuels; or fertilizers without external energy input. However; the key barrier for scaling this technology is that we do not yet know how to precisely control the complex behaviors of the reaction processes; and how to quantify the effects of various parameters. In this project; we apply machine learning to optimize the reactor/bioproduct performance in different contexts and track/quantify carbon removed; using one of the largest and most diverse datasets ever reported; generated under realistic field-like conditions. Our models can be generalized to other biomass-based carbon removal pathways. Our ultimate vision is to develop an automated; real-time strategy to coordinate/scale a fleet of decentralized reactors deployed in the field; and to customize the conversion of bioproducts tailored to local communities’ needs. When scaled globally; this will help mitigate more than a gigaton/year CO2-equivalent at full potential.,YankaiCao,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-15,mathematical analysis; scientific programming,None
32323,Developing Global Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning,For most machine learning problems; the dominant methods in practice are based on either heuristics or local optimization algorithms; producing sub-optimal solutions. The prevailing belief in the machine learning community is that global optimization is not necessary and not practically relevant for large datasets. In this project; we will focus on two fundamental machine learning tasks; centroid-based clustering and decision tree. We have developed a global optimization algorithm for these tasks based on a reduced-space spatial branch and bound scheme. This algorithm can guarantee convergence to the global optimum by only branching on the model parameters; whose size is independent of the dataset’s cardinality. Notably; our algorithm can address datasets with millions of samples (i.e.; 1000 times larger than the state-of-the-art methods in the literature). Our group has published many papers in high-impact journals and conferences; including the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML); Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS); Journal of Global Optimization; and Automatica. The student is expected to continue the development of scalable algorithms and perform numerical tests on extensive datasets. The student will develop in-depth knowledge of nonlinear optimization; mathematical analysis; scientific programming; and deep learning. Successful completion of the project will lead to a publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.,YankaiCao,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-15,mathematical analysis; scientific programming,None
32324,Internet of Things Secure Protocols,The basic concept behind the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) is to connect as many objects to the Internet as possible in an attempt to make our lives better in some way. However; connecting everyday objects like your car or house to the Internet can open up major security concerns. Our project focuses on creating and developing novel security frameworks for the Message Queue Transport Telemetry (MQTT) protocol based on publish/subscribe messages in order to enhance secure and privacy-friendly Internet of Things services. We may also if there is interest look at other IoT protocols like CoAP and Zigbee. MQTT has burst onto the IoT scene in recent years due to its lightweight design and ease of use and implementation that is necessary for IoT. MQTT came into the limelight for its use with Facebook Messenger and its direct links to IoT. What makes MQTT popular is its light footprint on both energy and computation. Where it is lacking; however; is in robust security. Although there is some level of security available for MQTT; it does not meet the high threshold needed for the future of IoT. Moreover; the security available does not have the efficiency in both energy and computational that is required. This project will focus on trying to develop security frameworks that will withstand the needs of IoT based solutions employing MQTT. It will involve design; framework; provable security; and finally programming; testing; and implementation of the Protocol itself. We have already published some preliminary work in this field in high impact venues and wish to continue the work further into 2023.,GautamSrivastava,Manitoba,Brandon University,English,2024-05-06,The student will need some exposure to Cryptography (potentially Quantum Cryptography) or basic understanding of cryptography.

32325,Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things,This project will attempt to better understand the limitations and challenges of Blockchain technology being applied to Internet of Things (IoT). For better or for worse; the propagation of Bitcoin-like currencies has shifted the focus of many towards a completely digital financial world. If we can slowly remove the layers of Bitcoin; we see a shining diamond at the core in the form of blockchain technology. The main observation to be made about blockchains is their ability to be used outside of the financial world; possibly re-inventing the way we handle many different applications of our day to day lives. However; one aspect that works well for Bitcoin and other digital currencies will most likely fall flat in other scenarios. The consensus scheme used by Bitcoin to confirm transactions is reward based and is not energy efficient. This research proposal looks at solving this shortcoming of blockchain technology and tries to further the application base of it. This project will look to fully identify and understand the limitations and shortcomings of blockchain technology.

32326,Federated Learning for the Internet of Things,The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally; AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications; by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this research project; we will dive into the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks; beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly; we will explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services; including IoT data sharing; data offloading and caching; attack detection; localization; mobile crowdsensing; and IoT privacy and security. We will focus on one area of use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare; smart transportation; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); smart cities; and smart industry. The important lessons learned from this research project of the FL-IoT services and applications will make for interesting extensions if the student wishes to pursue further education (MSc and PhD).,GautamSrivastava,Manitoba,Brandon University,English,2024-05-06,No skills available,None
32327,Glycerol Hydrogenolysis,In order to increase the conversion of the process and to improve the selectivity towards 1;3-propanediol; different catalysts will be prepared by different synthetic routes. These catalysts will then be tested in a batch reactor; and will be characterized by different analytical techniques (XRD; TEM; TPR...). The reaction will be studied by varying different parameters in the catalyst production to test which properties must be taken into account to achieve a high selectivity and conversion. We are interested in producing nanostructures that allow a selective rupture of the intermediate -OH group of glycerol. A research is needed to design the catalyst and its synthesis. Then it will be produced in the laboratory. The next step will be the characterization of the catalyst and finally its testing under different reaction conditions. After testing; the data will be analyzed to have a better understanding of the reaction and its changes with different catalysts. The student will work with a PhD student in each part of the process. This will help the student understand the importance of each step in the process.,FedericoGalli,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,English,2024-05-06,We require knowledge of heterogeneous catalysis; inorganic materials synthesis; organic chemistry; thermodynamics and kinetics; chemical engineering and process development.

32328,Blue hydrogen from methane to reduce emissions,The long-term objective long-term objectives (10-20y) of the research program is decarbonize the oil and gas industry through innovations in process engineering. Also other sources of non-fossil methane are target of the innovation proposed. Methane thermally or catalytically decomposes into solid carbon and hydrogen (CH4 → C +2 H2); with no emissions of greenhouse gases. However; coking is a great impediment to the development of small-scale pyrolysis. Web Of Science indexes 3828 articles published after 2018 using the keyword natural gas pyrolysis. These articles focus on fast pyrolysis for hydrogen and olefin production (2018) and on modeling and fast pyrolysis for biomass (cellulose and lignin) treatment. Little information is available concerning long residence time (high hydrocarbon conversion) pyrolysis as coking clogs the reactor; which is normally a plug flow fixed bed type reactor. Wang et al. found a correlation between gas temperature and coke structure but did not go into more depth because their work was focused on ceramic fillers; and they limited the time on stream to 240 min. The whole process results in the net production of solid carbon,FedericoGalli,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-13,Basic chemistry (very basic); work with common analytical techniques (GC; IR); understanding of process modelling,None
32330,Viral regulation of chromatin,ICP4 is the only essential HSV1 transcription activator. It is therefore absolutely critical for the successful takeover of the host cell and the production of progeny HSV1 virions. We have identified that ICP4 destabilizes chromatin by increasing the chromatin exchange of histones (histone dynamics). The regulation of histone dynamics is a novel activity for a viral protein that has never been described before. How ICP4 regulates histone dynamics is not known. It is also now known how ICP4- regulation of histone dynamics relates to its mechanisms to activate HSV1 gene expression. As a first step to characterize how ICP4 regulates histone dynamics; we aim to identify ICP4-interacting proteins using proximity ligation (BioID). This method uses a biotin ligase (BirA) fused to the protein of interest to biotinylate proteins within a small distance from the protein of interest. The biotinylated proteins are then purified; identified by mass spectrometry; and tested for their functional roles. This method will enable the identification of proteins that directly; indirectly; or transiently interact with ICP4; and it has never before been used for ICP4. By identifying what nuclear proteins interact with ICP4; we can test their functional relevance for ICP4 regulation of histone dynamics and begin to characterize this activity and how it relates to HSV1 nuclear takeover.,KristenConn,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic knowledge in the areas of cell biology and microbiology with some experience in common molecular biology techniques; including micropipetting.

32331,Chromatin dynamics during Equine herpesvirus infection,Equine herpesvirus (EHV1) is common throughout horse populations worldwide. EHV1 establishes a life-long infection that is largely asymptomatic. However; symptomatic disease manifestations can be severe and include neurological or respiratory disease; abortion; and even neonatal death. More knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of EHV1 infection is necessary to inform the development of new strategies to treat or prevent EHV1-associated diseases. We will use knowledge of the closely related alphaherpesvirus; herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1); to guide our characterization of the molecular mechanisms that regulate EHV1 chromatin and investigate how chromatin regulates EHV1 infection. Lytic HSV1 genomes are assembled into highly dynamic; transcriptionally competent; chromatin. Consistent with the highly dynamic HSV1 chromatin; HSV1 transcription activators destabilize chromatin by increasing the chromatin exchange of histones (histone dynamics). Alteration of histone dynamics is a novel consequence of viral infection. It is not known if this phenomenon is specific to HSV1 or if it is a conserved feature among alphaherpesviruses. To this end; we aim to evaluate EHV1 chromatin dynamics. We aim to test the stability of EHV1 chromatin using standard molecular biology assays. We will also directly evaluate histone dynamics in live EHV1-infected cells.,KristenConn,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic knowledge in the areas of cell biology and molecular biology with some experience in common molecular biology techniques; including micropipetting.

32332,Viral transcription factor dynamics,Chromatin regulates gene expression by regulating the access of the transcription machinery to the DNA. Gaining (and maintaining) access to DNA that is assembled in chromatin is a critical step for transcription. How ICP4-regulates transcription of HSV1 genes assembled in chromatin is not yet fully understood. The ICP4 DNA-binding domain binds to sequence-specific DNA sites. However; binding to DNA is generally considered non-essential for ICP4 to activate transcription. Instead; current models propose that ICP4 interacts with other cellular transcription factors and transcription co-activator proteins to bridge the promoter and terminator elements of ICP4-regulated genes. This “gene-looping” mechanism is suggested to increase the rate of RNA polymerase recycling onto ICP4-regulated gene promoters. This model suggests that ICP4 is stably located at ICP4-regulated gene promoters to establish and maintain the “gene loop”. Unfortunately; this model does not consider how ICP4 or other cellular transcription factors access the regulatory elements of ICP4-regulated genes in the presence of viral chromatin. To further our understanding of ICP4-regulated transcription; we aim to evaluate the nuclear mobility of ICP4 in live cells. If ICP4 stably binds to DNA (or chromatin) with high affinity; it would be expected to have slower nuclear mobility than if it engages in low-affinity binding events. The observed mobility of ICP4 will be related to the described mobilities of cellular transcription factors with well-characterized transcription regulation mechanisms (such as FoxA and Sox9). This information will increase our knowledge of ICP4 functions to enable further testing of the proposed model for ICP4-regulated transcription and support characterization of the mechanisms to overcome the chromatin barrier to access ICP4-regulated genes.,KristenConn,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,The student should have basic knowledge in the areas of cell biology and microbiology with some experience in common molecular biology techniques; including micropipetting.

32334,Characterizing soil hydraulic properties after exposure to dry-wet cycles,Experiment 1 will examine the effect of initial soil moisture content (25% of field capacity [FC]; 50% of FC; 75% of FC; and 100% FC) and soil texture (sand/loamy sand; clay loam & sandy loam) on soil physical properties including bulk density; aggregate stability; saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; and pore size distribution. The experiment will be laid out in a completely randomized design. Soil will be packed into sampling rings to a bulk density of 1.1 g cm-3 and kept at the initial moisture contents indicated above for the measurement of hydraulic properties. Units will be subjected to 10 DWCs with a 2-day dry period (30°C) in an incubator and a 1-day wet period (21°C). For the wet period; water will be added to units to attain original moisture content as indicated above. Control units kept at 21°C for the duration of the DWCs will be included for comparison. After DWCs; the unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity; bulk density; water retention properties at field capacity (20 kPa) and permanent wilting point (PWP) (1500 kPa); and aggregate stability will be measured using standard methods. Experiment 2 will build on experiment 1 with a similar set up using only 2 initial moisture content (25% and 75% of FC) to elucidate the impact of organic amendment on soil hydraulic properties in soils subjected to DWCs. Experimental units will consist of soils thoroughly mixed with organic amendments (no manure; liquid; and solid swine manure) packed as described above and subject to similar DWCs. After DWCs; similar measurements as in experiment 1 will be conducted. Results will increase our understanding of the impacts of DWCs and the effect of organic amendment on the resilience of soils to DWC impacts.,TheresaAdesanya,British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,English,2024-05-13,Undergraduate students enrolled in agriculture; agronomy; soil science; agroecology; biology; earth science or closely related programs will be best suited for this internship.

32335,Synthesis and characterization of high-temperature superconductor thin films,New superconductors could have a tremendous impact on our society; for example by increasing the efficiency of energy storage and transport as global consumption continues to grow; or by providing the basis for next-generation quantum computers; to name only a few. In this research; our main goals are to grow atomic layers of new superconductors; increase their transition temperatures; and help shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Among the different families of new superconducting materials; we are focusing on iron-based materials in thin film forms; where superconductivity in single atomic layers was only discovered a few years ago. No one had imagined that an iron-based material could be a superconductor because of iron’s famous magnetic properties since the conventional wisdom said that magnetic moments would destroy superconductivity. Instead; the iron-based superconductors have a relatively simple structure and exhibit a surprisingly high transition temperature. Small changes to the crystal structure and substitution of some atoms with different elements have pushed the transition temperature even higher; and no one knows yet what the limits are.,KeZou,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-31,No skills available,None
32336,Fracture detection from wrist ultrasound images using Deep Learning,The overall objective of this project is to develop a tool that can detect fractures of the wrist and elbow from ultrasound video sequences. Multiple clinical studies; including research conducted by our group; have established the potential of ultrasound as an alternative to X-rays for fracture detection. However; the key limitation to using ultrasound in clinical practice is the difficulty of interpreting ultrasound images. To address this limitation; we aim to develop AI tools that can automatically assess the image quality of musculoskeletal ultrasound images acquired by lightly trained users and provide a suggestive diagnosis for the image acquired. We have developed deep learning techniques to segment various parts of the wrist and elbow using supervised learning. However; acquiring large numbers of precise pixel-wise labels for ultrasound images is tedious; time-consuming; and prohibitively expensive. Therefore; this internship will focus on developing minimally supervised learning(MSL) techniques that can be used to train AI models on image-level labels; which are much easier to obtain.,AbhilashRakkunedeth Hareendranathan,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a background in Machine Learning and Computational Methods; as well as hands-on experience in Python programming and familiarity with commonly used machine learning libraries like Pytorch.

32338,Development of a Robotic System for Remote Inspection,The inspection of a construction site is an effective method for ensuring that a particular project is going as planned and in accordance with the project requirements and relevant standards and regulations. Traditional inspection necessitates periodic site visits from various professionals; meaning that the professionals engaged in these inspections must travel frequently between sites and employ various types of equipment for the assessment. This may pose safety and health risks; labour shortages; and gender discrimination; particularly in remote areas like northern Canada. As a favourable alternative to dispatching professionals to carry out site inspections in person; the goal of this project is to enable immersive and real-time remote construction inspection.

32340,Application of Mixed Reality Technology for Construction Management,Construction is a vast; dynamic; and complex industry that employs millions of people across Canada. Annually; it generates about $141 billion for the economy; accounting for 7.5% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP). Over the past few decades; the construction sector has remained labour-intensive with low productivity compared to other industries; as modern information technology is rarely used. The construction sector in Canada continues to grapple with issues such as safety concerns and skilled worker shortages. Mixed Reality (MR) has emerged as one of the top innovations transforming various industries. In this project; our goal is to develop innovative MR solutions to enhance current construction management practices; thereby improving safety and productivity in the construction sector. The project consists of two components: 1) The application of MR technology for skilled worker training: We will create a digital twin of the construction environment; enabling workers to learn the construction process and equipment handling in an immersive training environment through MR technology. 2) The application of MR technology to support construction operations: MR technology can merge virtual information with the real world; providing additional details about equipment and activities.

32341,OncoProfiler for early-stage cancer diagnosis,Efforts to achieve early detection have led to substantial improvements in cure and survival in patients with cancer. While the institution of routine screening is often very effective; we remain unable to identify all cancers at an early stage. The reason is twofold- non-existent screening for some cancers and invasive screening for others. Researchers at Toronto Metropolitan University have invented OncoProfiler; a quantum sensor that enhances the signal output of Raman microscopy and is capable of detecting trace amount of tumor associated content from patient blood. This non-invasive test offers several advantages such as a holistic picture of the tumor; rapid diagnosis and repeated sampling making it suitable for cancer screening. The ultra-sensitivity of the OncoProfiler has resulted in high diagnostic accuracy in cancer diagnosis; particularly for early-stage cancers. The proposed project tests the performance of OncoProfiler with a large set of blood samples from patients with confirmed stage I and II cancer diagnosis. We aim to test 12 different types of cancers; including colorectal; bladder; head and neck; hepatobiliary; lung; lymphoma; leukemia; ovary; pancreas; myeloma; esophageal/gastric; breast; thyroid; kidney; endometrium; prostate; melanoma; and sarcoma.,KrishnanVenkatakrishnan,Ontario,Toronto Metropolitan University,English,2024-05-06,General lab skills; general computer skills; graphic illustrations; figures and plots generation; report writing,None
32342,Development and utilization of transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines to study cardiac regeneration,Cardiac muscle re-perfusion is essential after myocardial infarction. Humans have a very limited capacity to efficiently grow new vessels (collaterals) to irrigate the damaged portion of the ventricle. On the contrary; zebrafish coronary vessels respond to injury by rapidly proliferating and growing; building a vascular network covering the injured area in few days. This response is critical to heart regeneration and limited to early stages after injury. Recapitulating mechanisms regulating the efficient revascularization of the zebrafish heart might have important therapeutic implications. We are interested in identifying important regulators of vascular biology involved in different aspects of revascularization and angiogenesis including sprouting; migration; specification and maturation. As part of our efforts; we develop sophisticated genetic models to investigate key regeneration processes. The student involved in this project will contribute to these efforts by developing mutant and transgenic zebrafish lines. This work will involve the use of CRISPR/Cas 9 technology and the Tol2 transposase system to genetically engineer zebrafish.

32345,Patient-engaged Health Research in the Scleroderma Patient-centred Intervention Network (SPIN),Patients have a right to be involved in their health care; and this includes research on their health. Working in partnership with patients to plan; conduct; interpret and communicate research can improve the quality of health research; the relevance and usefulness of research for patients; and the likelihood that research will be used by policymakers to make decisions about health care that reflect patients preferences and needs. However; patients are rarely involved in health research beyond study participants. This is often because little is known on how best to engage patients in health research and how to effectively share research results with patients. The present project aims to address these gaps; and is part of a larger multidisciplinary program of patient-engaged health research in SPIN. The project will involve working across a number of ongoing and planned studies including (i) evidence syntheses (systematic and scoping reviews) to identify evidence on ways to effectively engage patients in applied health research (ii) clinical trials to determine the best methods for communicating research results to patients (iii) stakeholder consultation including patients; patient organisation leaders; researchers and clinicians; to develop methods and progress our work towards developing a model for meaningful and effective patient engagement in health research that can be applied across diseases; conditions; and settings.,BrettThombs,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-06-03,The student should have a background in psychology or another health or health-related field and have an interest in working closely with patients.

32347,Regulatory Uncertainty and Market Microstructure: Models and Evidence,This project puts forward a novel method and model to measure the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. and Canada; as it is pertinent to the overall innovation landscape of some specific firms. Eventually; we examine how the regulatory uncertainty alters or spurs innovation of technology-driven vis-à-vis commodity companies. More importantly; using structured proxies and developed models we intend to comprehend how the evolution of regulatory uncertainty over time changes the major thrust of market microstructure—that is the ways in which the working processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs; prices; volume; and trading behavior—of selected firms. In addition; it is worth examining if the overall regulatory uncertainty affects production and innovation of companies very strongly; for instance through the granting or rescinding of rights to develop deposits on government lands; varying taxes and subsidies; varying environmental regulation; and evolving international treaties; e.g.; related to global warming. Thus; it is worth developing our regulatory measures that are tailored to technology and/or commodity firms; to see if a tight; robust; and highly significant evidence can be documented. The research endeavor anticipates bridging the disparity between theory and practice by developing two types of measures of regulatory uncertainty—government-based and news-based proxies specifically tailored to each business sector—i.e.; technological advancement or commodity market development. Furthermore; the project will necessitate execution of comparative analysis by performing a battery of simulation exercises and statistical analysis based on actual data of several U.S. and Canadian firms that are active in either basic materials or information technology sectors—listed on the NYSE; NASDAQ; and Toronto stock exchanges. Thus; we also envision to empirically testing the reliability and applicability of proposed regulatory uncertainty proxies and models as to elucidate when and how that type of uncertainty affects determinants of bid-ask spreads and market microstructure variables of selected companies.,Kamal Smimou,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-30,Research activities of this project will be undertaken predominantly through aspects of research training provided to the student.

32352,Susceptibility to posttraumatic disorders: towards a personalized medicine in psychiatry,Rationale: There is an urgent need to gain a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD risk to develop efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Veterans with PTSD have a higher chance of developing hypertension compared to those without PTSD. Chronic; low-grade inflammation is also consistently observed in both hypertension and PTSD; suggesting shared inflammatory components. Still; little data is available on the causal relationship between inflammation; blood pressure; and PTSD. Furthermore; there is still an urgent need to find biomarkers to quickly identify “at-risk” individuals. Of note; brain biomarkers for neurological diseases usually require invasive cerebrospinal fluid sampling as plasma levels may not be related to brain-specific sources. Recently; increasing attention has been drawn towards brain-derived exosomes. Brain-derived exosomes are produced by brain cells and reach the plasma after crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB); reach the plasma. Thus; brain-derived exosomes measurable in plasma may be a powerful tool to develop accessible biomarkers associated with PTSD risk. Aims and approaches: The proposed project aims to identify peripheral and brain biomarkers of increased susceptibility to psychological trauma; with a primary focus on blood pressure; inflammation; BBB integrity and brain-derived exosomes in mice. You will use our unique predator stress model of PTSD; in which avoidance behaviors will be assessed to divide the stressed group into “resilient” and “susceptible” mice. Peripheral and central inflammatory and exosomal markers; markers of BBB integrity; as well as blood pressure will be measured several times before and after predator exposure. The project will help to (1) determine the association between immune response; BBB integrity; and higher susceptibility to psychological trauma; and (2) identify early predictors of high vulnerability/PTSD risk for better targeting of "at-risk" individuals.,JessicaDeslauriers,Québec,Université Laval,Either English or French,2024-05-20,The student must be pursuing undergraduate studies (bachelor’s degree; or equivalent) in a field relevant to research: pharmacy; molecular biology; biomedical sciences; biochemistry or any other related discipline.

32353,Auditor-Client Relationship: A Machine Learning Approach,Professional relationships are critical to the appropriate functioning of our societies. Understanding how those relationships begin; continue and dissolve is crucial to the study of human decisions and behaviors (Rivera; 2010); it is a required precursor to the success of those relationships and the various efforts to improve them by practitioners and regulators (Kenrick et al.; 2006). Similarly; understanding auditor client relationships (ACRs); i.e.; how ACRs form; evolve though time; and terminate; is vital to the study of auditing as a social science; and to the advancement of audit practice and regulation. The purpose of this project is to investigate ACR formation; evolution and termination using advanced data analytics methods and tools such as Machine Learning. We seek to investigate how audit market participants; including regulators; auditors; and audit clients consider good” and “bad” auditor-client matches; and how these matches form; evolve; and eventually terminate throughout the ACR. This research project is expected to greatly advance scholarly knowledge about professional relationships and their dynamics. The project will also encourage interdisciplinary research in auditing and other disciplines such as Computer Science; Governance; Psychology and Sociology.,MohamedDrira,Nova Scotia,St. Mary's University,English,2024-05-01,I am looking for students in Computer Science; or Econometrics/Statistics/Quantitative Methods; with coding skills using Python; and/or R; and/or Stata; and similar data analytics techniques and tools.

32354,Corporate Reporting Analytics: A Machine Learning Approach,Corporate disclosures to the public are critical to the appropriate and smooth functioning of modern economies and societies and involve numerous sources and types of internal and external information. This research project focuses on one of the most important components of the corporate information environment; namely corporate reporting. This project will study firms listed in major North-American financial markets and will consider diverse types of corporate reports; such as annual audited financial reports; corporate social reports; and corporate sustainability reports to shareholders and other stakeholders. First; the proposed research will investigate the different features; attributes and characteristics of those various corporate reports. Second; the proposed project will examine the different internal and external factors affecting firms’ reporting decisions such as accounting factors; financial factors; governance factors; and most importantly; management characteristics.

32355,Signal processing, and machine learning techniques in medical science,In this project we use some methods in signal processing and machine learning to study different problems in different problems in medical science. We are currently working on several projects in my research lab (www.mlmelab.com) related to cancers; tumours; and COVID-19; and HIV-AIDS. In this project; we study; analyze and extract relevant information from biomedical signals and then apply filtering; noise reduction; feature extraction; and pattern recognition algorithms to uncover valuable insights about a patient's health condition. We use signal processing methods to enhance medical image (such as CT scan; MRI; ultrasound) quality; remove noise; improve resolution; segment anatomical structures; and extract features for diagnostic purposes. We apply signal processing techniques; such as digital filtering; adaptive filtering; Fourier transform; and wavelet transform; to effectively remove noise; enhance signal quality; and improve the accuracy of subsequent analysis and diagnosis. We also utilize signal processing algorithms to extract relevant features from biomedical signals or images that can provide valuable diagnostic information. These features can include time-domain or frequency-domain characteristics; statistical measures; wavelet coefficients; Fourier coefficients; or morphological features. We apply signal processing techniques to genomic and proteomic data to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of information contained within. This involves tasks such as DNA sequence alignment; gene expression analysis; motif finding; and protein structure prediction. Signal processing algorithms play a crucial role in identifying patterns; detecting anomalies; and extracting meaningful information from genomic data. Furthermore; we apply machine learning algorithms to classify medical data into different categories or classes. For example; classifying medical images as normal or abnormal; or diagnosing diseases based on symptoms. We also utilize regression analysis; clustering; natural language processing; deep learning; and time series analysis; to predict patient outcomes; extract information from medical text data; detecting tumors and analyzing pathology slides.,MohammadHassanzadeh,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Any undergraduate student (second year or above) of the fields mentioned before will be fine for this project.

32357,Rotator Cuff full-thickness tear assessment using Reinforcement Learning (RL),Shoulder injuries are a common occurrence in adults; and they are currently assessed using ultrasound or MRI. Compared to MRI; ultrasound assessment is fast; safe; and cost-effective; however; obtaining an ultrasound image that contains all the necessary imaging landmarks to assess a full-thickness tear is often challenging. As a result; only a few sonographers are able to perform this ultrasound examination. The objective of this project is to use reinforcement learning techniques to develop an intelligent agent that can automatically perform an analysis on shoulder ultrasound videos acquired by a lightly trained user. The first task in the image analysis pipeline is to identify the relevant frames from an ultrasound video. We aim to use deep reinforcement learning techniques that combine the representational power of deep learning with reinforcement learning. The potential of DRL in medicine and medical imaging has not yet been fully explored. In this internship; the student will have an opportunity to work on a DRL model to detect the most relevant slices from a rotator cuff ultrasound video.,AbhilashRakkunedeth Hareendranathan,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-01,The student should have a background in Machine Learning and Computational Methods; as well as hands-on experience in Python programming and familiarity with commonly used machine learning libraries like Pytorch.

32358,User experience (UX) design for AI-empowered systems,In recent years; AI-empowered software systems; such as music and video recommendation applications; voice assistance systems; decision support tools; and intelligent cyber-physical systems (e.g.; drones); have grown significantly. While the technology behind these systems is increasingly powerful; today's AI-empowered systems are experiencing a user experience (UX) design innovation crisis; which limits their ability to truly improve people's lives and meet practical needs. The overall goal of this project is to investigate; create; and assess a new set of UX design-support techniques and tools that harness the power of intelligent data-driven systems to support end users. These techniques and tools can facilitate the collaborative and creative UX design process; and assist software practitioners in creating more usable and innovative data-driven systems. To achieve this; we will focus on identifying; modelling; detecting; and using UX design patterns that capture the emergent characteristics of AI systems. Based on these patterns; creativity support tools will be investigated to help UX designers organize and retrieve design artifacts (e.g.; sketches; mock-ups; and storyboards). Further; tools that use these design patterns will also be studied for synchronous and asynchronous design collaboration among various multidisciplinary stakeholders (e.g.; designers; developers; data scientists; and end users). These efforts take a human-centered perspective; involving designers and other software stakeholders throughout the process of proposing; creating; and evaluating techniques and tools.,JinghuiCheng,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-20,- Motivated learner; critical thinker; and team contributor - Experience or interests in human-computer interaction and/or user-centered interaction design - Passionate for UX and design,None
32359,Investigating tools to support diverse members of open source software communities,Depending on their roles; open source software (OSS) stakeholders; such as developers; designers; managers; and users; to just name a few; have diverse needs of information from the Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs). In our previous work; we have identified nine roles of OSS practitioners based on the contributive activities they performed towards their projects. We have also identified 16 categories of information that exists in the issue discussion threads that can potentially support OSS practitioners retrieve and discover useful and otherwise hidden elements from the discussion threads. Supervised; automated techniques have been used to classify the issue discussion sentences into these information types. However; it is unrealistic to expect these automated techniques to achieve 100% accuracy. Thus; following a human-in-the-loop ideology; effective user interaction design needs to be put in place to make these efforts beneficial to the real OSS practitioners. In this project; we will leverage our previous studies to explore the design of a role-based; AI-enabled but human-in-the-loop tool to support diverse OSS stakeholders in discovering and retrieving information that is relevant to their goals and needs from the ITSs. We will follow a user-centered; iterative process in the design and development of this tool. Namely; we will start by creating a set of personas of OSS stakeholders based on previous studies. We will then create sketches and wireframes to explore the design space with the OSS stakeholders. The fidelity of the prototypes will be increased continuously with gradually added automated modules to iteratively meet the users’ expectations. The finished system will be deployed and tested with real OSS stakeholders. In terms of interaction design ideas; we will explore ways to encourage collaborative tagging in the context of OSS development with the support of machine-generated suggestions.,JinghuiCheng,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-20,- Motivated learner; critical thinker; and team contributor. - Experience and/or knowledge in user-centered interaction design techniques; such as personas; sketching; wireframing; user testing; and prototype development. - Front-end development skills in HTML; CSS; and JavaScript. - Knowledge and/or skills in front-end and back-end architectures/APIs. - Motivation and ability to adapt to a new programming language and/or a new development environment.,None
32360,Intelligent mining of user interface design artifacts,During UCD; Design examples are obtained; used and shared to draw an analogy from full-fledged previous designs. This analogical technique is important because arguably all design starts with transforming; combining; and adapting elements from previous works. Additionally; the previous designs provide a shortcut for articulating complex interaction concepts and thus support inspiration and improves communication. For example; designers of a new online photo sharing platform may draw analogy from Twitter and Facebook to illustrate the commenting user interface; while some users may provide feedback that an interface similar to Google Docs or Acrobat Reader is preferred because they need to attach comments to a specific portion of the photo. While design examples are useful for inspiration and communication; software practitioners have experienced significant challenges when incorporating this technique in their practice. One major reason is limited tool support. Particularly; design examples are usually stored as images; with little information ready for searching and modification; historical information and user feedback is also stored out of context. Therefore; the goal of this project is to leverage recent machine learning technologies to help interaction designers further exploit design examples during user-centered design. We will focus on developing a set of technologies as an infrastructure to help interaction designers leverage the internal and external structure of their design artifacts. The project has three major steps. First; we will focus on identifying the design elements in the design examples. Second; we will use the information about the interactive elements to automatically identify the relationships among the design examples. Third; we plan to explore semi-automatic techniques that match the design elements and their relationships identified in the previous steps to established interaction design patterns (e.g. those in Tidwell’s patterns). In all steps; we plan to explore machine learning models to identify and categorize the interaction elements.,JinghuiCheng,Québec,École Polytechnique de Montréal,English,2024-05-20,- Motivated learner; critical thinker; and team contributor - Knowledge and/or interests in user-centered interaction design. - Experience and/or skills in machine learning techniques for image processing. - Experience in python - Motivation and ability to learn a machine learning library (e.g. PyTorch).,None

32363,Examining the Health, Wellbeing, and Quality of Life of Older Adults and Caregivers Living in Rural and Northern Areas,In Canada; one in five older adults live in rural communities. These older adults are often vulnerable; facing multiple challenges to access health care services including poor access to community services/supports; lower incomes; higher costs of living; and challenges with transportation/mobility. Informal caregivers play an important role to support older adults to remain in their communities and age in place. Over 8 million Canadians provided care to a family member or friend who had a long-term health condition; disability; or age-related problem. In rural and northern communities in Canada; the importance of caregiver engagement to support navigation of service access and utilization for older adults is paramount. Students will assist with a literature review to help understand how caregivers support older adults to access care services and navigate the Canadian healthcare system. As a member of Dr. Freeman’s interdisciplinary team; the MITACs intern will conduct a scoping review synthesizing recent research findings on the role caregivers play to support older adults to navigate the healthcare system. Furthermore this scoping review aims to identify and describe the health literacy of rural caregivers specific to northern communities in Canada. With the emergence of literature focusing on role of caregivers as healthcare system navigators as well as expanding of information on health literacy; it is very timely for this scoping review to identify the barriers and facilitators caregivers experience when assisting older adults to navigate the health care system specific to a rural and northern context.

32364,Examining the Role of Technology to Support Aging in Place in Rural and Northern Communities,Older adults living in rural areas are often vulnerable; facing multiple challenges to access health care including poor access to care; lack of community services; lower incomes; higher costs of living; and challenges with transportation. Use of eHealth technology by older adults is increasing but has been embraced differently than younger persons. In rural; remote; and northern communities in Canada; the importance of eHealth technology including mobile health apps and telehealth has steadily grown in recent years. This research project aims to better understand how older adults perceive and use/do not use eHealth technology. This project works closely with knowledge users from the regional health authority and older adults in northern British Columbia. The intern will be engaged in three ongoing research projects piloting innovative technologies in rural communities. Currently funded projects include looking at lighting for wayfinding for persons with dementia; adaptive clothing to support persons with Parkinson's; and effects of COVID-19 on technology use. The MITACs intern will be involved in a variety of ongoing research activities including literature searching; interviewing older adults and care providers; analysing data and writing of reports.

32366,Nanomaterial electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion,The research project entails the development of nanomaterials geared towards renewable energy conversion. Specifically; the transformation of CO2 to fuels and value added chemicals; powered by renewable electricity; will be pursued here. Metallic nanoparticles with rationally designed surface catalytic sites will be synthesized with wet-chemical routes. Following their characterization with techniques such as XPS; TEM and XRD; their performance will be investigated through a host of electrochemical methods. Specifically; we will aim to develop nanoparticles that convert CO2 to multi-carbon products. The project will explore how surface chemistry (e.g. functional ligands; types of active sites...) stabilizes CO2 reduction intermediates and steers the reaction down a desired pathway. In tandem; in situ Raman spectroscopy will elucidate the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface throughout the course of reaction and will provide a direct link between the catalyst structure and its overall activity+selectivity.

32367,AI x AR: Combining Augmented Reality with AI for Immersive Media,Summary: In this project; we explore AI for Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) towards immersive media for authoring; sketching; communication; and presentation. Through this project; we will demonstrate how AR expands the future of communication tools by developing a prototype system using Hololens or Mobile AR. Please see the following as an example. - Teachable Reality https://ryosuzuki.org/teachable-reality/ - RealitySketch: https://ryosuzuki.org/realitysketch/ - Snap Creative Challenge: https://www.snapcreativechallenge.com/takeaways2021/ - Touchable Spoken Words: https://science.ucalgary.ca/news/touchable-spoken-words-bring-fantastic-life Background: Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) is becoming the next computing platform. AR interfaces can provide an exciting opportunity that the current desktop or mobile interfaces cannot do --- it overlays information on top of the physical environment; so that we can seamlessly interact with digital worlds within the physical space; instead of touching or interacting with a screen. Goal and Research Questions: By leveraging this capability; AR/MR interfaces have a great promise for communication tools to enhance co-located or remote conversation; discussion; and presentation. The goal of this research is to "re-design" such communication tools for the coming augmented reality era---where we no longer use slides or powerpoints but shows the content interactively embedded in the real world. There are many research questions to explore: 1) how can we incorporate Natural Language Processing into AR; 2) how can we enable the user to communicate through different modalities like sketching and conversation; and 3) how can we leverage the spatial and physical interactions by leveraging AR. Methodology and Publication Venue: To answer these questions; we have three steps: 1) design: discuss and decide what kind of AR interfaces we should make; 2) prototype: create a working prototype with A-Frame/Three.js or Unity; and 3) evaluation: conduct a user evaluation study to measure how useful such a tool could be. Based on these findings; we also write a paper which we plan,RyoSuzuki,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-01,First; the student should have a strong "motivation" in publishing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research to the top venue like CHI or UIST.

We welcome students from diverse backgrounds (not necessarily in CS; as HCI is an interdisciplinary field); but we expect the student has minimal knowledge or experience in software and hardware prototyping. Previous experience in 3D programming (Unity; Unreal; Three.js; A-Frame; 8th Wall; etc) is a huge plus.,None
32370,Maskwio'mi: Biomedical Studies of a Re-Discovered Mi'kmaq Traditional Skin Remedy from Birch Bark,The proposed Globalink project is a continuation of previous successful Globalink project involves the study of medicinal properties of birch bark extracts. Preliminary results show that the extract of birch (betula papyrifera) made in a fire pit method by the Mi'kmaq people contains more than 200 organic compounds. The student project involves the determination of medicinal properties; such as antibiotic properties; of this extract as a whole and of fractionations thereof. Bierenstiel developed new technology using electricity to substitute the conditions in a fire pit. This allows a better control of the extract conditions. Preliminary results show that this new technology allows faster reaction time and more product yield. The student will be trained using the new extractor technology to safely produce the extract from birch bark in the laboratory. During this process; the different extracts are fractionated as a function of time and extraction conditions (as well as compared to extract from the fire pit method) and then studied using newly built microbiology lab. The student will be trained to independently setup antibiotic and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) experiments. The student’s role is to fully assist in the research data gathering of maskwio'mi for chemical analysis (NMR; FTIR; FT-Raman; UV-vis; UPLC-QToF-MSMS; GC-MSMS) and provide essential data for scientific publications.

32372,Freshwater food webs across the globe,Ecological communities are organized into complex networks of trophic interactions between the species that are part of them; namely food-webs. These webs depict the patterns of energy flow and nutrient cycling among the different compartments of the ecosystem; processes that are essential to ecosystem functioning. Their functioning depends on their structure; including the number; abundance; and functional traits of the species that are part of the network. Hence; any natural or anthropogenic variation (e.g.; river damming; habitat type) that affects species distribution changes the way that food-webs are structured and might change; consequently; its functioning. Modelling the structure and dynamics of food-webs is frequently a hard task given the lack of information about species trophic interactions. To facilitate such as goal; this project aims to build a global-scale open database of predator-prey interactions in freshwaters. This will be initially carried out through a systematic review of the primary literature (articles published in scientific journals) and grey literature (conference abstracts; undergraduate and graduate dissertations) in any language. The review will collect multiple information from the literature; including predator identity and size; prey identity and consumed abundance/volume; geographic location; sampling size; and habitat type. Extracted information will be integrated into the database through a workflow that will automatically fill out a wide range of climate and impact-related variables provided by remote sensing. This research project will be the starting point to large-scale analyses that will allow us to (i) model the trophic interactions performed by freshwater species in different scenarios; (ii) understand how natural and anthropogenic variation in nature affects predator-prey dynamics; and (iii) predict how future changes will affect the structure and dynamics of freshwater food webs.,BrunoEleres Soares,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-05-01,The student must have a background in environmental sciences; zoology; or ecology in order to better grasp the goals and nuances of the project.

32373,Machine learning for immune dynamics,A typical immune response is multiplexed and highly dynamical: after exposure to a pathogen; cytokines are secreted and multiple cells are activated. Recently; we identified a “universal antigen encoding” phenomenon; quantifying and modelling how the immune system encodes information in the dynamics of the cytokines (see Achar et al; Science; 376; 880-884). But one still does not know how a single immune cell interprets that information. Using a robotic platform it is possible now to monitor multiple markers in single cells as a function of time and thus to reverse-engineer the way immune cells "interpret" such information. The goal of the internship is to 1. use machine learning to analyze data provided by our collaborators at NIH; to understand the structure of the data and build an interpretable embedding 2. build a mathematical model of the dynamics in latent space in response to different antigen strengths,PaulFrancois,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-06-03,Students should have formal training in either physics or computer science; and some practical knowledge of machine learning algorithms and concepts (dimensional reduction; neural networks; etc...).

32377,Understanding determinants of aquatic biodiversity in Southern Quebec,One of the most pressing issues of the 21st century is the alarming decrease in biodiversity; which poses a significant threat to both ecosystem services and human well-being. Endangered species are facing the risk of extinction worldwide; while many common species are also experiencing significant declines in their population. Although this decline is occurring across various taxonomic groups; there is noticeable variation in species' responses to global changes in different regions. This variation presents an opportunity to investigate the factors that determine a species' ability to adapt to new environmental conditions. To do so; it is necessary to develop a more profound comprehension of the underlying biodiversity changes using field survey; laboratory experiments; and statistical models. Such knowledge is crucial for estimating changes in ecosystem services; informing policy decisions; and guiding sustainable management strategies and conservation efforts. The concern is growing that protected sites located near disturbed areas such as farmlands or urban agglomerations may not be sufficient to maintain biodiversity in stressful conditions (e.g.; climate change). As a result; it is necessary to identify the factors that influence species distribution to improve biodiversity conservation in a changing world. A study will be carried out to understand the determinants of biodiversity distribution in freshwater ecosystems by surveying a group of wetlands in Southern Quebec; both protected and unprotected; several times during the summer. This study will record various environmental variables and quantify the diversity of aquatic fauna. The survey will be conducted in collaboration with Ducks Unlimited; a non-governmental organization committed to wetland conservation. The findings of this study will help inform the conservation actions of the organization.,RassimKhelifa,Québec,Concordia University,English,2024-06-03,The student should have basic knowledge of ecology and biodiversity.

32379,Valid inequalities for the quadratic knapsack problem,The quadratic knapsack problem (QKP) is an optimization problem which consists of maximizing a quadratic (profit) function with binary variables subject to a single knapsack constraint. This is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem; with a variety of important applications; for example in the location of satellites; airports; railway stations and freight terminals. This problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense.

32381,ODE analysis of iterative methods,The goal of this project is to apply tools of differential equations to analyze convergence of various numerical methods to solve nonlinear systems of equations and minimize scalar-valued functions. Newton's method to solve the nonlinear system of equations F(x)=0 is x_{n+1}=x_n - F'(x_n)^{-1} F(x_n). If we consider x=x(t); a smooth function of time; instead of a sequence of vectors; it turns out that Newton's iteration is exactly Euler's iteration to solve the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) x'=-F'(x)^{-1} F(x) with a step size of one! Tools from ODEs (eg; Lyapunov functionals) can now be used to analyze the convergence of this continuous Newton's method. Under some assumptions; the solution of the ODE converges to a solution of the original nonlinear system F(x)=0 in the limit t approaching infinity! This project investigates: i) ODE formulation of Broyden's iteration; another iteration for solving F=0 that does not require the knowledge of the Jacobian F'; ii) ODE formulation of BFGS iteration which minimizes a scalar function; and iii) ODE formulation of nonlinear conjugate gradient iteration which minimizes a scalar function. The latter iteration is particularly relevant today because of its relevance to machine learning. See the paper by W. Su; S. Boyd and E.

32382,Sphingolipids metabolism alterations in cancer: novel biomarker and potential drug target,Our group recently showed that the accumulation and depletion of specific sphingolipid species are implicated in progression of cancer; however; the mechanisms remain unknown. For instance; in our investigations of patients compared to healthy volunteers; glucosylceramides (GluCer) accumulated; were further increased in aggressive biology; and exhibited pro-proliferative effects in cancer cells. Furthermore; the GluCer-mediated proliferative phenotype was reversed by inhibiting their synthesis using ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitors; with an additive reduction in co-treatment with other targeted anticancer agents. Thus; specific sphingolipids may serve as prognostic markers; and inhibiting enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis has potential as a therapeutic approach. It is thus critical to better understand the biosynthesis of sphingolipids and learn more on their impact on cancer cell phenotypes.,ChantalGuillemette,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-06,molecular biology; bioinformatics; biochemistry strong interest in oncology rigorous team work Université Laval is a french speaking university.

32383,Dual inhibition of telomere maintenance pathways in cancer,Telomeres; the repetitive ends of chromosomes; shorten with ageing. When a critical telomere length is reached; normal cells stop dividing and enter senescence. Tumor cells; however; bypass this stage of senescence and continue cell divisions with critically short; dysfunctional telomeres. To enable such continued cell divisions; they activate telomere maintenance pathways: 85% of cancers activate telomerase to survive with dysfunctional telomeres; 15% activate the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway (ALT). Work by our group and others show that cells treated with telomerase inhibitors activate ALT and escape the effects of telomerase inhibition. We have developed a new approach to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting both telomere maintenance pathways in multiple myeloma. This dual inhibition of telomere maintenance pathways will prevent cells from escaping inhibition when just one of the pathways is blocked. By targeting both telomere maintenance pathways; we expect the cells to be unable to proliferate and/or will die. This approach has been proven by our group to negatively affect cell viability in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma; but has never been tested in additional cancers. We expect this combined treatment approach to also be effective in other cancer types for several reasons: 1) cancer is characterized by telomere dysfunction; the highest level of dysfunction is found in the most aggressive forms; 2) cancer cells need telomere maintenance pathways to survive; 3) cancer cells initially respond to the inhibition of telomerase but this treatment alone is not sufficient: we argue that this is due to the fact that ALT will be activated and allow the cells to survive when telomerase is inhibited; and 4) our previous work using dual telomere maintenance inhibition in Hodgkin’s Lymphoma has successfully killed the cells.,SabineMai,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-04-30,basic knowledge of cancer biology and cell biology.

32384,Power-boundedness of matrices,Given a square matrix A. It is said to be power-bounded if M(A) = sup_{k >= 0} |A^k| < infinity; where | . | is the matrix 2-norm. If A is power-bounded; can we give a sharp estimate of M(A)? This problem plays an important role in the study of Markov chains; the stability of numerical methods to solve differential equations; etc. While necessary and sufficient conditions are known for determining power-boundedness of matrices; these conditions are not applicable in practice; in general; because they don't depend continuously on the matrix. These conditions also give no information about the magnitude of M(A) when it is finite. Our goal is to use a resolvent condition; which depends continuously on the matrix; to determine power-boundedness and its magnitude in case M(A) is finite. One such condition; known as the Kreiss resolvent condition; is known; but the bound depends on n; the dimension of the matrix; making it useless for operators on infinite dimensional spaces. Hence an added requirement is that the resolvent condition must be independent on n. We have candidate resolvent conditions that improve upon the Kreiss resolvent condition; but they are still dependent on n.,ShaunLui,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,- matrix theory (norms; Jordan form) - real and complex analysis,None

32386,Hardware design for tactile human-robot interaction detection based on sound,Physical interactions between robot and humans are typically measured using torque sensors are the robot joints; or a 6-axis force/torque sensor at the wrist of the robot. However; these sensors can be expensive; and not all robots are equipped with those. Additionally; they can only provide the general location of a contact: for example; somewhere on the arm or on the hand. Lacking more precise information; the ability of the robot to evaluate the intention behind the contact and to react appropriately is limited. In this project; we are exploring the use of microphones placed on the body of the robot to identify where contacts occur; from the sound that is produced when something touches the hard shell of the robot.,MarieCharbonneau,Alberta,University of Calgary,English,2024-05-06,Prior knowledge of engineering design; circuits and signal processing; as well as basic CAD software and programming (C and/or Python) skills; will be of great help to complete this project!

32388,Molecular cancer prevention,Our working model is the nickel uptake system of Helicobacter pylori; one of the most successful human pathogens; causing mild to severe gastric pathologies accounting for about one million deaths per year worldwide (mostly cancers). The bacterium is notably considered a leading cause of gastric cancers and MALT lymphoma; as such the World Health Organization identifies H. pylori as a group 1 (definite) carcinogen; and experts estimate that 1 to 3% of the infected population will develop gastric carcinoma; a pathology with poor prognosis (15% survival 5 years after prognosis) representing the third most common cause of death by cancer. The bacterium colonizes the stomach of 50% of the worldwide population where the pathogen survival relies on its ability to scavenge nickel from the gastric milieu. Helicobacter pylori eradication is advised as first-line therapy in early stage disease of gastric MALT lymphoma; complete remission is achieved in 75% of cases; but the treatment is effective with a limited number of antibiotics that are active in the stomach. Nickel transporters in H. pylori are of notable medical relevance as they display critical nickel-uptake function enabling colonization of the host; but also serve as passageway for bismuth-based therapeutics currently used in H. pylori eradication regiments. The research project investigates the transport mechanisms of nickel and bismuth-derivative drugs across the membranes of H. pylori using structural biology and biochemical approaches. We aim at accelerating research on these medically relevant proteins by elucidating their structures and functional mechanisms to promote the discovery of innovative strategies to treat the burden of H. pylori associated cancers. The research project will contribute to develop novel anti-pylori molecules; and improve current bismuth-based therapies; which are much needed to overcome the emergence of resistant H. pylori strain,CharlesCalmettes,Québec,Université INRS,Either English or French,2024-05-01,The project will consist in investigating the structure-function relationship of nickel transporters and nickel-homeostasis proteins.

32394,Biochemical and structural studies of bacterial secretion systems,Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are versatile and dynamic nano-machines that Gram-negative bacteria have adapted for numerous different biological functions. These include killing competing bacteria; pathogenesis; and direct communication with any type of cell (mammalian; reptile; plant). The T6SS is analogous to a crossbow that shoots poisoned arrows to kill enemy cells. However; bacteria have also evolved immunity mechanisms to resist their enemies in a back-and-forth arms race of poisonous effectors versus life-saving immunity proteins.

32397,Leafhoppers population dynamics in strawberry fields in Quebec,In the last years; with an increase of temperatures; several new insects are more and more frequent in Quebec. Not only that; the number of insect pests is also exponentially increasing; like for example the leafhoppers. A leafhopper is the common name for any species from the family Cicadellidae. These insects are plant feeders that suck plant sap and during the feeding; if the number of insects on the plant is very high; can cause devastating damage. Another problem is that leafhoppers are well known vectors of virus and bacterial diseases putting the risk of several crops. Here in Quebec; there have been particular problems with leafhoppers affecting strawberry fields. Quebec is the number one producer of strawberry in Canada; and every day is trying to reduce as much as possible the amount of insecticide in the field.

32398,Biochemical and structural studies bacteriophage proteins,Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or GAS) is a major pathogen that infects and kills millions of people world-wide annually. Central to its pathogenicity are toxins that are encoded within the bacteriophages that infect Streptococcus. Through infection; bacteriophages transfer new and multiple toxins between bacterial hosts creating new strains of deadly bacteria. Our aim is to understand this process at the biochemical level by discovering how the bacteriophage manipulates the various pathways of its Streptococcus host.

Purified proteins will then be studied biophysically and their structures determined by the appropriate structural biology technique (X-ray crystallography; NMR; or cryoEM). We will then use this data to study the biochemistry of the phage protein; the biochemistry of the streptococcus host protein; and study how the phage manipulates the activity of the host protein. We also aim to determine the structures of the proteins in complex. This project will involve a wide range of biochemical assays and functional assays.

32400,Examining the effects of manipulative warming, nitrogen addition and vegetation composition on greenhouse gas emissions from boreal peatlands,Northern peatlands; persistently contributing to climate cooling; store ~30% of the world’s terrestrial soil carbon (C); equivalent to half of the total atmospheric C. This enormous storage of soil C results from a persistently greater production than its decomposition. Moreover; northern peatlands are globally significant sources of methane (CH4). Therefore; northern peatlands represent a globally important reservoir of soil C and play an important role in the global C cycle and climate system. The ecosystem greenhouse gas (GHG) emission function of northern peatlands is tightly coupled to climate through its feedback to changes in hydrology and vegetation composition. However; the majority of peatlands are located in boreal ecosystems where the climate is experiencing a warmer climate and increased atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition also occurs. Therefore; the ecosystem functions of GHG emissions of boreal peatlands are susceptible to changes in climate via changes in soil climate and vegetation composition that may result from the projected warming and increased atmospheric N deposition. However; no field experiments have been carried out to examine how the GHG emission of boreal peatlands responds to the concurrent changes in soil climate; N addition; and vegetation composition. This unknown knowledge has caused significant uncertainty in projecting the role that boreal peatlands will play in the global C cycling in the context of climate change due to the lack of understanding of how ecosystem functions respond to climate change and human disturbances. To address the above outstanding issue; this proposed program is to examine how the GHG emissions in boreal peatlands respond to the concurrent warming and N addition and how they are regulated by changes in vegetation composition via a globally unique manipulative field experiment. This exploratory project will lead us to enhance our mechanistic understanding of how boreal peatlands respond to climate and land-use changes.,JianghuaWu,Newfoundland and Labrador,Memorial University of Newfoundland,English,2024-05-20,Some knowledge of physical geography; soil science; ecosystem ecology and biology and wetlands; in general; will be an asset.

32402,Seismic performance of reinforced concrete slab-to-wall connections using 3D nonlinear finite element methods,The research will investigate the seismic behavior of reinforced concrete slab-to-wall connections with a focus on the shear transfer mechanism that occurs between the slab and the wall. Previously tested models of typical connections under combined vertical and cyclic lateral loads will be simulated using advanced nonlinear finite element methods with the objective to study the mechanics of in-plane shear transfer that occurs at the slab-wall connection and the combined effects of the deep beam action developing in the plane of the slab and the moment transfer due to gravity loads. The numerical results in terms of lateral load resistance curves; cracking patterns and characteristics of connection failure will be used for model calibration and verification. Next; the model will be used to conduct a detailed parametric investigation to examine the strength and deformation capacity of the connection for lateral load transfer as a function of gravity load transfer. The effects of the two combined actions on the rotation capacity and the effective stiffness of the slab wall assembly will be explored with reference to the detailing of the reinforcement anchored through the connection and the direction of lateral load action relative to the longitudinal axis of the wall cross-section. The numerical study will be extended to consider the effect of slab boundary conditions along the wall axis; as a parameter in the evaluation of punching failure at the toe of the slab wall connection.,AikateriniGenikomsou,Ontario,Queen's University,English,2024-05-01,The student should have background in structural analysis; reinforced concrete design; finite element methods.

32403,Decentralized Learning for Computer-aided Diagnosis of Cancer,Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have created a wealth of novel research opportunities in developing new and fully automated methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies (e.g.; kidney cancer) in medical images. Despite recent intriguing success; AI-based methods still face challenges that impede their efficacy in medical imaging applications; including algorithms that are not well generalized to unseen data; limited image datasets; and annotations due to patient privacy concerns. While the hospitals have terabytes of data; its access is limited not only by the prohibitive time and cost to annotate images by the experts but also by privacy constraints (e.g.; need for Research Ethics Board approval for data sharing). Most of the deep learning (DL) models developed for medical imaging uses a centralized learning; where the entire dataset is required to be on a single site. Therefore; due to challenges in sharing medical data; datasets used to train the algorithms are quite limited (<200); resulting in the algorithms not being able to generalize to unseen data. In contrast; decentralized machine learning methods; such as federated learning and split learning; have the potential to address the patient privacy issue; as DL models can be trained without the need to share medical images externally. Instead; only weighting of the DL models can be aggregated on a central site. This way; more data at multiple sites can be utilized for building robust DL models for cancer detection. Since it is a fairly new research topic; applications of federated learning and split learning for medical imaging have been very limited and remains an open problem. In this project; the potential students will develop decentralized machine learning based methods (e.g. federated learning) to automatically classify medical images as cancer vs. normal. The students will then compare performance of decentralized to that of centralized methods.,EranUkwatta,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-06,The potential students are expected to have some prior experience in programming using Matlab and Python.

32405,Additive manufacturing of high entropy alloy,High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a type of advanced material composed of five or more metals in approximately equal proportions. They are characterized by their high strength; excellent ductility; and superior resistance to wear; corrosion; and high-temperature deformation. The manufacturing of HEAs traditionally involves methods like arc melting; induction melting; sintering; and casting. Additive manufacturing (AM) of HEA alloys for industrial applications is still a relatively new and developing technology; so more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and limitations. Current research includes studying the effects of different alloy compositions; process parameters; and post-processing treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of printed HEAs. High melting points of HEAs can pose a challenge for 3D printing which can make it difficult to achieve the right melting and solidification conditions needed to create a defect-free part. Additionally; the cooling rate during the printing process can affect the microstructure and mechanical properties of the HEA; which can impact the strength and durability of the final product. Furthermore; the printing process can introduce porosity or other defects in the HEA; which can compromise the mechanical properties. To mitigate these issues; we propose processes optimization during the AM of HEAs; which requires a multi-faceted approach; considering the various factors that contribute to the quality of the final product. This requires a detailed understanding of the relationship between the AM process parameters; the microstructure of the HEA; and the resulting mechanical properties.,Abu SyedKabir,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,A robust understanding of Materials Science and Physical Metallurgy is crucial for the student.

32406,Contact killing of COVID-19 by copper-based nanoparticles.,The primary goal of this proposal is to decipher the virucidal efficacy of carboxymethyl cellulose copper (CMC-Cu) nanoparticles against COVID-19 (formally named SARS-CoV-2). The studies will be performed in partnership with a Canadian company. Microbes are rapidly killed on surfaces of copper and copper alloys through a process named copper-mediated "contact killing". Furthermore; a recent study has revealed that COVID-19 is not viable upon exposure to copper surfaces. Of significance; copper concentrations required to kill microbes are not toxic for humans. Creating "self-disinfecting surfaces" by coating inanimate surfaces with copper is difficult to apply for practical and economic reasons. However; an exciting avenue is the recent discovery of CMC-Cu as an effective alternative to one-step disinfectant agent that significantly reduces microbial levels on surfaces and inanimate objects. Using an innovative method enabling production of MLV-based COVID-19 pseudotyped particles in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory; we will investigate COVID-19 unstability and its inability to attach and infect target cells in the presence of CMC-Cu in the absence of other reagent or in the presence of selected disinfectant products.,SimonLabbe,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-01,Highly interested student who is eager to learn molecular and cellular biology as well as yeast genetics.

32408,Molecular basis of heme acquisition.,Heme has a wealth of functions in biological systems; making it an essential micronutrient for all living organisms. Defects in heme homeostasis are directly responsible for diseases; and have been tied to impaired development; metabolic syndromes and fungal virulence. Consequently; it is critical to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular bases of heme-dependent proteins in living systems. The research project will use a model system to decipher the interplay between important proteins involved in heme acquisition. Furthermore; inhibitors will be tested as potential anti-fungal drugs against heme-dependent proteins as they are required for invasion of fungal cells. Our studies use the model organism S pombe. This yeast; unlike S cerevisiae; can assimilate exogenous heme; allowing the use of the power of genetics to selectively block heme biosynthesis; setting conditions to investigate the mechanisms by which external heme is taken up by the cells.

32411,Experimental Particle Physics: Study of Rare Kaon and Pion Decays with CERN Experiment NA62,NA62 at CERN and PIONEER at the Paul Scherrer Institut study rare kaon and pion decays. High precision measurements represent incisive probes of lepton and quark flavor physics. The reactions studied are sensitive to many new physics models not accessible by other reactions which extend the Standard Model (SM) to solve its considerable problems. The suppression of the rare decay branching fractions in the SM to the levels as low as 10-10 allows physics beyond the SM to contribute dramatically with large enhancements above SM predictions. NA62 expects to have sensitivity for observing 100 events at the SM level for ultra-rare process of a kaon decay to a pion plus neutrinos and studies many other rare or forbidden reactions to search for dark matter; heavy sterile neutrinos; neutral pion decays; and radiative processes.

32415,Quantum dot optoelectronics for photonic integrated circuits,The explosive growth of global IP traffic drives the dramatic expansion of data centers with thousands of servers. It also brings the issue of significant power consumption. Integrated photonic circuit (PIC) technology is proposed and it can improve the performance of datacenter transceivers while reduce their energy consumptions. PIC technology is currently focusing on silicon photonics; which integrates light sources; optical modulators; and photodetectors onto silicon chips to realize ultrafast data transmission. The technology utilizes light with wavelength in near-infrared (NIR) region to transfer data. However; due to inadequate light absorption in NIR region; silicon is not a suitable material for photodetection in PIC.

32416,Hypervalent iodine-mediated synthesis,One of the potential research projects available to summer interns concerns new fluorination reactions. Organofluorine compounds are important in medicinal chemistry; agrochemistry; and in medical imaging; and explorations of fluorinated compounds within these fields has ballooned over the past few decades. Developing new reagents and strategies for the synthesis of fluorine-containing building blocks; especially those not readily accessible using existing state-of-the-art methodologies; is economically and socially important; and it remains a critical research endeavor. We are developing new hypervalent iodine (HVI)-based fluorination reactions because they serve as sources of “electrophilic” fluorine; which provide an entry into chemical reactivity of the fictitious F+ ion. A benefit of this chemistry is that the HVI-based fluorination reagents differ from other electrophilic fluorination reagents; as they can lead to a variety of product types. (Difluoroiodo)toluene (TolIF2); is one such reagent; possessing two fluorine ligands on the iodine atom; with one being “electrophilic” and one nucleophilic. It reacts as a stable; solid alternative to fluorine gas. The efficient and highly selective fluorinating ability of TolIF2 is driven by the reduction of iodine (III) to iodine (I) which; when coupled with its easy and inexpensive synthesis; its mild reactivity and its environmentally-benign reaction conditions; holds significant potential for discovering valuable new fluorination reactions; especially for medical imaging probe development. Another option is the blue LED chemistry. Simple light-mediated reactions of iodonium ylides is an unexplored area of chemistry that has huge potential.

32422,Prototyping a smart mirror for polypharmacy,Nearly 70% of Canadian seniors over age 65 take five or more medications daily; and around 10% take 15 or more. Taking excessive amounts of medications; referred to as polypharmacy; can lead to adverse health effects; which include increased mortality rates; falls; adverse drug reactions; and increased length of stay at the hospital. Unnecessary and excessive medication consumption in seniors; which is the basis for polypharmacy; is directly proportional to the number of drugs; frequency of their use; and cognitive conditions of the user. There are many approaches to reducing polypharmacy; ranging from health professional interventions to supportive technologies - in this proposal; we focus on these technology-driven approaches. Smart devices have recently become more ubiquitous and are widely adopted for health monitoring. However; due to perceived complex user interactions; mobile phones; and wearables may present an increased cognitive load; an undesirable effect in seniors. As an alternative; we propose to optimize medication self-management using familiar; everyday objects to be smart and supportive technologies for reducing polypharmacy without placing increased cognitive demands on the users. Specifically; this research project focuses on prototyping a proof of concept of a smart mirror that reminds medication consumption for senior users by tracking a bottle when shown to a camera embedded in the mirror. The mirror presents a seamless user interface where the medication bottle becomes the unique input mechanism that produces visual information feedback regarding the time and intake dose. To understand the feasibility of this approach; we will conduct a design thinking session to capture user needs and conduct a preliminary study with content experts to understand the potential of the application. Finally; we will present a demo to an advisory/focus group to assess user preferences compared to wearable and smart mirror.,Alvaro JoffreUribe Quevedo,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-01,Programming and makerspace skills are highly appreciated.

32423,Development of catalyst for syngas conversion in a sustainable matter,The conversion and capture of greenhouse gases; in particular CO2; have been investigated in several studies; considering their negative impact to the environment as well as their potential to produce high value-added chemical products. Therefore; CO2 hydrogenation remains the most widely adopted process for producing methanol; based on specific operating conditions and a suitable catalyst for improving reaction kinetics and promoting species selectivity. The purpose of this study is to develop a new approach for the synthesis of catalysts used in methanol production; via physical and chemical methods. There are a variety of catalysts reported in the literature for methanol production under different operating conditions; including temperature and pressure. In this context; we focused on the synthesis of binary catalysts containing ZnO and Al2O3 and ternary catalysts comprising CuO; ZnO and Al2O3 through physical synthesis (Plasma RF). These synthesized catalysts will be characterized by various techniques; including XRF; XRD; TEM; TGA and BET. By means of the techniques; the molar ratios; composition; morphology; reduction behavior and specific surface area of the catalysts will be studied. Then; these catalysts will be intended for a series of tests to evaluate their catalytic activities in a fixed-bed reactor to produce methanol from CO2 hydrogenation with the aid of response surface methodology.,FedericoGalli,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-15,Chemical engineering; laboratory and catalysis experience; data analysis,None

The objective is to maximize the performance of this system; considering several constraints such as budget and minimum performance threshold. In this project; the system's performance (availability) will be evaluated using an efficient and fast method such as the UMGF method. Among the factors that can have a significant influence on such systems; we can mention the implemented maintenance plan (type and frequency of preventive maintenance actions) as well as the technology and/or the number of machines connected in parallel.

32426,Engineering of injection-moulded sustainable composites from waste textiles and non-recyclable waste plastics for new industrial uses,The collaborative research project will convert non-recyclable waste plastics and waste textiles into sustainable carbon and utilize hard-to-recycle plastic waste as the matrix to develop advanced composites for manufacturing of automotive parts. Of the 440 million tons of plastics the world produces annually; only about 9% is recycled. The rest end up in landfills; litter or are incinerated. Mixed plastics and multi-layer packaging are hard to recycle or not recyclable at all. Textile waste is one of the fastest growing sources of waste; fueled by the availability of cheap clothes and the global “fast fashion" phenomenon. Textiles contain a mix of synthetic materials such as polyesters and nylon often with cotton and wool. In this project; the Bioproducts Discovery and Development Centre (BDDC) of the University of Guelph; which has pioneered the research of biobased carbon and composites; will utilize waste textiles and non-recyclable plastics to produce sustainable carbon through controlled catalytic pyrolysis. The synergistic co-conversion can greatly boost the carbonization efficiency and yield. The recycled plastics will be reinforced with the sustainable carbon to engineer advanced composites.

32427,Eco-design of smart products: a methodological perspective,Digital and connectivity technologies have given consumers access to a large number of "smart" products. However; in the context of an evolving society and sustainable development; the question of the environmental impact of these products arises. These products integrate mechanical; electrical and electronic components; as well as digital and communications technologies; most of which require related infrastructures. All these components and infrastructures are likely to have significant environmental impacts. In parallel; previous work has shown that there is relatively little scientific literature on the application of eco-design practices to the development of smart products. This project postulates that these smart products and technological developments will continue; and that it might therefore be relevant to attempt to apply an eco-design approach to reduce their impacts. Although an applied aspect may be envisaged if time allows; the project essentially focuses on the methodological aspects of eco-design through an analysis of the scientific literature (literature review and evolution of the publications number). The literature review will confirm or refute the hypothesis that there is little literature addressing the application of eco-design to the development of intelligent/multidisciplinary products. This will provide an updated base of previous work. On the basis of this work; and of existing work in eco-design; the research approach will explore complementary associations between different methods and tools; for a possible practical application to a case study.,JuliaGuérineau,Québec,École de Technologie Supérieure,Either English or French,2024-06-26,Students with a strong interest in both the environment and technology; hoping to find an answer to the famous question "Is it possible to conciliate technological and sustainable developments?”.

32428,Policing Saskatchewan: Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) Youths Speak Out,Statistics Canada’s detailed analyses of the perceptions and selfreported experiences of diverse populations in Canada submit that the Black and Indigenous (BIPOC) populations are twice as likely to mistrust police. Particularly; BIPOC youths experience brutality; stereotyping and various other forms of discrimination at the hand of police officers. While this is a reality throughout the country; specific discriminatory practices from police officers have been experienced in several regions; such as the Canadian Prairies. Saskatchewan; a province on the prairie; has played a particularly negative role in Canadian history concerning policing and surveillance. Police brutality and discrimination have been exhibited repeatedly. One protocol has been the infamous Starlight tour; which involved picking up Indigenous men; women; and boys; then leaving them miles outside the city on subzero winter nights; leading to Saskatoon's freezing deaths. Police were also involved in the mishandled cases of many Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MWIW). Death cases are also directly linked to police brutality; racial discrimination and negligence in Black communities. These experiences; among others; are antithetical to the mission and vision of many police services in the country; which is to serve and protect. Although policing alone cannot solve public safety concerns and complex social issues; policing plays a significant role in how citizens from BIPOC communities and cultures are perceived. Little has been reported about racialized youths’ perceptions of the police in Saskatchewan. This research fills that gap; exploring BIPOC youths’ experiences and perceptions of policing in Saskatchewan and raising community voices through storytelling and audio drama. Research questions to explore include: 1) What are the experiences and perceptions of BIPOC youth on policing in Saskatchewan? 2) In what ways can the policing experiences and perceptions of immigrant BlPOC youth create space for dialogue on policing in Saskatchewan?,TaiwoAfolabi,Saskatchewan,University of Regina,English,2024-06-03,Background in creative and artistic forms of expression and media is preferred.

32429,Zero-waste alternatives to single-use plastics,The appeal of biodegradable packaging is an increasingly attractive solution for the management and disposal of plastic packaging. The benefits and limitations of biodegradable materials are important when we seek to understand biomaterials’ structure and properties; and their correlation with performances and their resulting environmental impact. This research focuses on responding to the market needs to find alternative solutions to the current petro-based multi-layer packaging that have comparable properties and cost effectiveness without the negative environmental impact. To overcome the negative environmental impact; the innovative materials must be demonstrated to offer acceptable biodegradability under a wide range of environmental conditions. The project is expected to support the development of innovative materials for single-use packaging applications. The research project will explore biodegradable resin compositions in high-melt strength flexible films and rigid sheets. To impart improved properties and/or added functionality in compostable materials for sustainable packaging; we will focus on reinforcements from a range of renewable materials.

32431,Designing AI-based Vision System for Improved Simultaneous Localization and Mapping,Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a promising localization technology for robots since it does not require any external localization infrastructure. Traditional SLAM algorithms build a metric map of the surrounding environment and estimate the location of the robot in the map based on the current sensor information. In addition to constructing a metric map; a line of recent research aims to extract semantic information (via computer vision techniques) from the environment; embed it into the metric map; and therefore improve the mapping and/or localization performance. The goal of project is to leverage the AI-based computer vision (CV) technology to incorporate high-level semantic understanding into traditional SLAM systems for better performance. The students will be designing and developing an AI-based CV system for a mobile robot running traditional SLAM algorithms; and then testing and investigating alternative design options. The students will learn how to read and understand literature in the field; how to design and develop a prototype model; and finally have an opportunity to work on a scholarly publication.,ChaoShen,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-06,,None
32432,Building Resilient Futures: Analyzing Smart City Disaster Resilience through Agent-Infrastructure-Institution Networks,In today's society; the paradigm of urban disaster governance is shifting towards "disaster resilience" in the face of extreme climate change and social crises. The role of smart cities in empowering urban resilience presents a significant challenge in smart city development and governance. However; existing research often fails to bridge the gap between human agents and physical infrastructure in smart city resilience. Institutional frameworks for disaster resilience also lag behind real-world needs; resulting in significant investments with low effectiveness. To address these gaps; the research project establishes an agent-infrastructure-institution network; recognizing the holistic nature of smart city resilience. It aims to empower cities to adapt and thrive amidst extreme events and challenges; not just resist and prevent disasters. The project's analytical framework comprehensively understands the intricate relationship between agents; infrastructure; and institutions under potential disasters. It optimizes resource allocation and enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of resilience strategies in smart cities. The project builds an analytical framework to assess the disaster resilience of smart city systems; encompassing the agent system; infrastructure system; institutional system; and their interconnectedness. It applies this framework to evaluate the resilience of single or multiple smart cities; considering spatial and temporal characteristics. Additionally; it compares trade-offs between smart city investments and resilience; offering policy implications. Methods such as dynamic network analysis; multi-criteria decision making; systematic review; and qualitative analysis are employed. Through this research; valuable insights will be gained on enhancing smart city resilience. By bridging the gap between agents and infrastructure; improving institutional frameworks; and employing robust analysis; the project contributes to the development of resilient and sustainable smart cities. Ultimately; the findings will inform policies and investments; paving the way for urban environments that can withstand and prosper amidst diverse challenges.,HaiboFeng,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Given the multidisciplinary nature of the project; the ideal candidate may possess a combination of knowledge and expertise in various fields; such as engineering; public management; environment science; etc. Priority will be given to students with the following skills and backgrounds. 1.

32434,Reduction of environmental footprint of wood buildings through performance-based design (PBD) -Rojini,The primary objective of the research is to assess the feasibility of timber buildings in Canada; with a specific focus on engineered wood materials such as CLT; Glulam; NLT; and others. The aim is to identify optimal structural solutions for each building element that minimize carbon emissions and ensure high structural stability; particularly in seismic areas. The research will involve conducting more than 30 structural analyses using software like ABAQUS/Opensees; as well as life cycle assessments using OpenLCA; to evaluate various wood building systems; including energy simulations. Due to the large number of models involved; manually performing all the simulations within the three-year research period is not feasible. Therefore; the study recommends automating the calculations by utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques. Tools like Dynamo or Grasshopper can be employed to consolidate all the analyses and results in a single platform; enabling the evaluation of different design changes efficiently. To obtain optimal results and develop a comprehensive framework; machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks will be applied for analysis and decision-making. Furthermore; the research will focus on assembling a robust carbon emission database specifically for timber construction; as there is currently a lack of such databases in Canada; except for areas like Quebec and Montreal. The database generated in this study will be open for use by other researchers and industry professionals; encouraging collaboration and the expansion of the database to include more cities across Canada.,HaiboFeng,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The student undertaking this research should have a strong knowledge of Building Information Modelling (BIM) software; such as Revit; and be familiar with tools like Dynamo or Grasshopper for automation purposes.

While not mandatory; having a foundational understanding of structural engineering concepts would be advantageous for this study.,None
32435,Development of a computational tool for discovering potential cancer biomarkers,Early diagnosis of cancer can significantly improve the survival rate of patients. For example; when diagnosed early; the five-year survival rate of ovarian cancer patients was 93%; which dropped to 31% when the cancer was found at a late stage. Conventional diagnostic imaging tests suffer from insensitivity and inaccuracy; often requiring surgery to retrieve sample tissues to confirm the disease. In comparison; detecting cancer biomarkers in blood samples is much less invasive than surgery. The blood is enriched with biomolecules secreted from all over the body through body circulation. The candidate biomarkers contained in the blood can thus be potentially used for early diagnostics. However; one of the major bottlenecks for current blood-based cancer detection is the lack of efficient biomarkers. Multiple databases have been established to collect experimental data from cancer researchers around the world; however; there is a lack of bioinformatic tools to analyze those data for in-silico selection of cancer biomarkers in the blood. In this project; we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline for in-silico analysis and selection of potential biomarkers for detecting various cancers based on the technology we have established in the lab. Experimental data containing biomarker expression levels will be collected from several high-impact public databases and synthesized. Biomarkers with a high potential to distinguish cancer and normal samples will be selected. Multiple types of biomarkers; including proteins; nucleic acids; and exosomes; will be investigated for systemic biomarker identification based on multi-omics approaches. This project will pave the way for blood-test-based non-invasive diagnostics of cancer at an early stage; offering a helping hand to tens of millions of cancer patients in the world.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with general academic background in computer science; biological/biomedical engineering; computer engineering; software engineering; systems and technology engineering; or biology are welcome to apply.

32436,Development of low-cost multiplexed bioassays for early cancer diagnostics,Cancer is a complex disease and requires the study of multiple molecules to provide a more comprehensive view of its cause and nature. In light of its complexity; microarray technology has become a powerful tool in cancer studies. Thousands to tens of thousands of miniaturized bioassays can be conducted in parallel on a single chip; enabling high-throughput measurement of biomolecules. Among those molecules; proteins are of particular interest; because they are the nanomachines of life and can directly provide pathological information at the functional level. Antibody microarrays contain arrays of antibodies; with each spot ~100 micrometers in size. They have been used to measure tens to hundreds of proteins simultaneously. Although powerful; antibody microarrays are not widely accessible to most laboratories; largely due to the need for expensive equipment such as a fluorescence microarray scanner for fluorescence signal acquisition. To address this problem; we will develop a loc-cost antibody microarray-based assay; with the assay signals detectable using a conventional flatbed document scanner. The project will reduce the equipment cost by 50-100 folds; thus making the microarray technology widely accessible for most laboratories. A sandwich immunoassay format will be adopted for highly sensitive and specific protein measurement. Specifically; primary antibodies will be arrayed on a glass slide using a microarray spotter. Then; secondary antibodies will be applied after incubation of biological samples (e.g.; blood plasma). Several strategies for developing colorimetric signals will be investigated. The assay sensitivity and reproducibility will be compared with conventional fluorescence-based assays. This project will pave the way for low-cost microarrays; enabling their wider application in both research and clinical labs.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with a general academic background in biochemistry; biological sciences; biological/biomedical engineering; or chemistry are welcome to apply.

32437,Measuring exosomal proteins for early cancer diagnosis using a novel nano-sensor,Early diagnosis of cancer can significantly improve the survival rate of patients. For example; when diagnosed early; the five-year survival rate of ovarian cancer patients was 93%; which dropped to 31% when the cancer was found at a late stage. Conventional diagnostic imaging tests suffer from insensitivity and inaccuracy; often requiring a surgery to retrieve sample tissues to confirm the disease. In comparison; exosome is a type of emerging biomarker that can detect cancer early via non-invasive blood tests. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles ranging from 30-150 nm in size; secreted from all cells into the body circulation. The biomolecules (e.g.; proteins; nucleic acids; lipids) carried by exosomes are very similar to their cells of origin including those in cancer cells; and thus can be detected to report the presence of cancer. The relatively high concentration of exosomes in the blood provides them with the capacity for early cancer diagnosis. In this project; we will develop an assay for highly sensitive and accurate measurement of cancer-related exosome proteins based on a nano-sensor established in Dr. Li’s lab. Exosomes will be purified from blood plasma or serum samples using size exclusion chromatography. The concentration and size distribution of the purified exosomes will be characterized with dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy techniques. Next; various strategies to quantify exosome protein markers using the nano-sensor will be investigated for both exosome membrane proteins and intra-vesicular proteins. The assay sensitivity; accuracy; and reproducibility will be evaluated with biostatistics tools. Blood samples from ovarian and bone cancer patients will be tested to demonstrate the assay performance. This project will pave the way for blood-test-based non-invasive diagnosis of cancer at a very early stage; offering a helping hand to tens of millions of cancer patients in the world.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with a general academic background in biochemistry; biological sciences; biological/biomedical engineering; medical sciences; or chemistry are welcome to apply.

32438,Development of a new antibody array for multiplexed bioassays towards cancer diagnostics,Cancer is a complex disease and requires the study of multiple molecules to provide a more comprehensive view of its nature. In light of its complexity; microarray technology has become a powerful tool in cancer studies. Thousands to tens of thousands of miniaturized bioassays can be conducted in parallel on a single chip; enabling high-throughput measurement of biomolecules. However; conventional antibody microarrays have a size limitation of each micro-spot of at least ~ 100 μm in diameter. This size limitation restricts assay throughput and sensitivity; which is usually required for early diagnosis. We will develop and implement a micro-fabrication process to bring down the size limitation of antibody microarrays; achieving a 1-10 μm range for the size of each spot. Multiple parameters will be optimized to create uniform microarray spots with good spot morphology in large areas. After that; the fabricated antibody microarray will be used for highly sensitive multiplexed cancer protein quantification. The project will make the microarray technology suitable for highly sensitive cancer protein measurement; enabling its broader application for early diagnosis.,HuiyanLi,Ontario,University of Guelph,English,2024-05-01,Students with a general academic background in biochemistry; biological sciences; biological/biomedical engineering; or chemistry are welcome.

32440,On the biogeochemical cycle of selenium (Se): making the first ambient measurements of atmospheric Se,In this project; we will use proton transfer reaction time-of-flight (PTR-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS); Vocus S (TOFWERK; Aerodyne; Inc.) in conjunction with online gas chromatography (GC) (Aerodyne; Inc.); to measure Se in the atmosphere. Compared to the conventionally used ICP-MS for Se measurements; the Vocus allows for real-time measurements of atmospherically relevant analyte concentrations. Furthermore; the high mass resolution of this instrument in combination with the unique isotopic composition of Se offers the possibility for unambiguous identification of Se species of interest. With a focus on method development; our efforts are targeted towards lowering the detection limit for key selenium compounds like dimethyl selenide; dimethyldiselenide and dimethylseleniumsulfide.

32441,Lab-scale assessment of amended bioretention systems for emerging contaminant mitigation,This research project assesses the sorption and degradation of stormwater contaminants in bioretention systems using laboratory-scale experiments. This project aims to develop novel soil amendments that enhance contaminant degradation by producing reactive intermediates such as hydroxyl radicals; which rapidly react with emerging contaminants. The project will involve collecting and analyzing samples from bioretention columns in Dr. Scholes’ lab that contain soil amended for contaminant degradation. In these experiments; stormwater is introduced to the top of a soil column and filters through the soil. Periodic wetting and drying cycles; which result in variable redox conditions in the soil; will be simulated by varying the influent flow rates to the columns. The student will be responsible for maintaining the flow through the soil columns (making fresh influent solutions; checking pump flow rates) and collecting samples pre- and post-column treatment. The student will analyze samples for general water quality parameters (pH; dissolved oxygen) and concentrations of organic carbon; nitrogen; and iron. The student will work directly with a graduate student researcher to prepare samples for emerging contaminant analysis.

32442,Domain Adaptation for Regression Problems,While domain adaptation has been actively studied for classification problems; how to adapt regression models remains elusive. In this project; we will address several fundamental aspects of domain adaptation for regression. Ideally; the project will end up with a paper published at a top-tier ML/CV conference (e.g.; CVPR; ICML). The key strengths/objectives of our project include: -- We will leverage the tools from information theoretic principles to develop new theoretical insights for domain adaptive regression problems. In other words; we will adopt the principles of transfer learning to explain and motivate our algorithm. -- Our proposed framework will also support the robustness of label noise; which is ubiquitous in real-world applications. For regression problems; there exist two types of label noise: 1) data-dependent noise due to non-expert annotators or crowdsourcing-like platforms. For example; it is usually expensive to ask a doctor to annotate a large number of medical images; but it is possible to ask a number of medical students to label the images; with the risk that their labeling may be imperfect. 2) asymmetric noise due to the pseudo-labels assigned by the source model during the UDA process.

32443,Knowledge Transfer in Artificial Intelligence Systems,Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques; especially deep learning; have advanced significantly in recent years; but their success relies on huge amount data; and they only perform well on the tasks for which they have been trained. To solve this issue; we will develop a comprehensive approach to knowledge transfer in artificial intelligence systems; addressing fundamental issues of safe transfer and adaptation to changing environments with guaranteed performance. The key strengths of our project include: -- Safe Transfer Between Diverse Tasks: Our approach will autonomously transfer knowledge between diverse tasks and models; supporting cross-domain transfer between tasks with different features/actions; and even transfer across learning paradigms (e.g.; using knowledge from classification tasks to inform regression). The formal notion of domain divergence will be developed and be utilized to provide guarantees on safety and performance. High-level task descriptions will be used to bootstrap rapid learning on new tasks; enabling zero-shot transfer. -- Modeling the Non-Stationary Environments of Tasks: Our approach will also model the non-stationary distribution of tasks in the environment; including support for gradual task drift and abrupt changes; allowing the system to adapt over its lifetime. These task distributions connect to all aspects of our approach; allowing the system to anticipate future tasks; generate a curriculum of learning tasks toward a given goal; and provide guarantees on expected performance. -- Applications: We will apply our methods to analyze brain signals in various scenarios. Our techniques are particularly compelling in these applications because collecting brain signals is usually expensive and time consuming. By knowledge transfer; we can leverage the experiences accumulated previously form other subjects/data sets to improve the performance for a new subject.,BoyuWang,Ontario,Western University,English,2024-06-03,You may be a strong candidate if you have (at least three of the following): - a strong background in statistics; linear algebra - knowledge of machine learning; optimization - published academic work on the topics of machine learning - sufficient programming experience (e.g.; Python; Matlab) - some experiences on advanced machine learning paradigms (e.g.; transfer learning; lifelong learning; meta-learning) - some experiences on EEG signal analysis (e.g.; signal processing; feature extraction; motor imagery/SSVEP-based BCI) - good English reading and speaking skills Disabled applicants will receive priority in case they have equal qualifications.,None
32444,Quantum signal processing, Quantum image processing and quantum Fouier Transform,Quantum computing is a interesting process that uses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too large or complex for traditional computers. Quantum computers rely on qubits to run and solve multidimensional quantum algorithms. These days; researchers and companies around the world; specially Canada; are actively working on developing and refining quantum computing technologies. In this project we are working on aspects of quantum computing in quantum signal and image processing. Traditional signal processing deals with the analysis; transformation; and manipulation of signals; such as audio; video; or electromagnetic waves. In this project we are extending these subjects and the traditional techniques like filtering; modulation; compression; to extract useful information from signals by leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. One of the key advantages of quantum signal processing is the potential for exponential speedup in certain signal-related computations. For example; quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can efficiently compute the Fourier transform of a signal; which is a fundamental operation in signal processing. In this project; the students learn about Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Time permitting we explore more quantum transformations such as quantum wavelet transform; and quantum Discrete Cosine Transform and their potential applications in quantum computing related to quantum signal and image processing. The QFT is a quantum analogue of the classical discrete Fourier transform (DFT) which offers an interesting way to perform arithmetic operations on a quantum computer. We like to investigate applications of QFT in Shor's Algorithm;Quantum Phase Estimation; Quantum Data Compression; Quantum Signal Processing; Quantum Machine Learning; and Quantum Error Correction.

32448,Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds from Air Using Photocatalytic processes,Problem of air pollution is growing fast because of the emission of pollutants from industrial plants; exhaust of cars and change in our lifestyle due to more urbanization. Materials such as CO; NOx; SOx; and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are considered as principal pollutants of the environment with adverse health impacts on people. VOCs are one of the most commonly found pollutants in indoor and outdoor environments. Currently; there are five major methods for removal of VOCs including adsorption; photocatalytic oxidation; ozonation; non-thermal plasma and catalytic oxidation. A new and highly promising approach is to use a photocatalyst that facilitates reaction of UV with hydrocarbon air pollutants in air. This process is called Photocatalytic oxidation.

32450,Application of catalysts to enhance degradation of emerging pollutants in water using ozone,The presence of emerging pollutants (chemicals such as pesticides; residual pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in surface water bodies is becoming a serious concern not only for their environmental impact; but also for their potentially serious adverse effects on human health. Innovative water treatment technologies are under investigation to determine their potential application in current drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities in eliminating these emerging pollutants in water. In order to reduce the concentrations of emerging pollutants in water; reaction with ozone (O3) assisted by solid catalysts is considered a potentially viable process. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent that is produced from oxygen using available ozone generators. Since ozone is highly unstable in water; it is necessary to assess the efficiency of different catalysts that increase ozone stability and selectivity in its reaction with various emerging pollutants in water. The purpose of the present project is to compare the efficiency of ozonation in the presence of three solid catalysts (activated carbon; alumina and modified alumina developed in our laboratory) in terms of target compound removal and ozone consumption. A semi-continuous reaction system is currently used in our laboratory to evaluate catalyst effectiveness and to study effects of operating parameters. Different stages of the experimental work involve the following steps: • Comparing the levels of ozone consumption and emerging pollutant removal at different catalyst doses • Performing equilibrium adsorption experiments to establish the effects of compound adsorption on the catalysts • Determining time required for maximum pollutant removal based on kinetic parameters The research project involves different scientific activities.

32451,Using ultrasound for decomposition of emerging pollutants in water,The presence of emerging pollutants (chemicals such as pesticides; residual pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in surface water bodies is becoming a serious concern not only for their environmental impact; but also for their potentially serious adverse effects on human health. Innovative water treatment technologies are under investigation to determine their potential application in current drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities in eliminating these emerging pollutants in water. In order to eliminate emerging pollutants from water; advanced oxidation reactions and degradation with ultrasound can be used. In an ultrasound process; high frequency sonic waves are beamed into water. Interaction of sonic waves in water generates micro-bubbles within a very short period of time. Generation and destruction of micro-bubbles creates very high local temperature and pressure levels. Under these extreme conditions; thermal degradation can destroy any chemical compound. In addition; active chemical species (ions; radicals; ..) are generated in the reaction medium leading to reaction through advanced oxidation reactions. Combination of ultrasound and ozone (O3; an active allotrope of oxygen) can lead to development of water treatment process concepts based on ozonative advanced oxidation reactions. The purpose of the present project is to compare the efficiency of sonication in the presence of ozone for degradation of selected emerging pollutants in water. A semi-continuous reaction system which is currently used in our laboratory will be used for the process. Different stages of the experimental work involve the following steps: • Comparing the levels of ozone consumption and emerging pollutants removal under different sonication conditions • Determining time required for maximum emerging pollutants removal based on kinetic parameters and modeling of the process The research project involves different scientific activities.

32452,Application of adsorption, advanced oxidation and catalytic ozonation in removing antibiotics from water and wastewater,Presence of emerging pollutants (chemicals such as pesticides; residual pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in surface water bodies is becoming a serious concern not only for their environmental impact; but also for their potentially serious adverse effects on human health. Antibiotics are important class of emerging pollutants in nature. Presence of antibiotics in nature can lead to development of antibiotics resistant strains of bacteria. This is an important health concern. Innovative water treatment technologies are under investigation to determine their potential application in current drinking water and wastewater treatment process to remove antibiotics from water. In order to reduce the concentrations of antibiotics in water; reaction with ozone (O3) assisted by solid catalysts is considered a potentially viable process.

32453,Investigating the epigenetic factor LSD1 in the development of cancer,Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A) is a histone-modifying enzyme that removes methyl groups on histone tails; and by doing so regulates the expression of many genes important for cell proliferation. Aberrant expression of LSD1 has been shown in many types of cancers (neuroblastoma; leukemia; breast; lung or colorectal cancers) when compared with the corresponding healthy tissues. In the cells; alternative splicing of LSD1 gene produces a LSD1 transcript containing an extra exon (exon 2a). This LSD1+2a transcript encodes an LSD1 isoform protein containing a new domain of 20 amino acids. This LSD1+2a isoform is expressed in all cell types and represents approximately 30% of LSD1 proteins. We have identified the LSD1+2a isoform as potentially important for cell cycle regulation and chromosome segregation. The overall objective of the project is to understand the involvement of the LSD1+2a isoform in the development of cancer. Objective 1. Study LSD1+2a cellular functions. We will perform gain and loss of function experiments to explore the role of LSD1+2a in maintaining chromosome integrity through the cell cycle Objective 2.

32454,Epigenetic memory of stem cells in aging,The transcription factors Oct4; Sox2; Klf4 and c-Myc can reprogram any somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Since this breakthrough; mixed findings have been published regarding the importance of the age for a successful reprogramming. Groups have reported that reprogramming efficiency declines with age while others have successfully generated iPSCs from senescent and centenarian cells. Important questions remain to be addressed: do the reprogramming process totally reset the aging clock (e.g. telomere shortening)? Do iPSCs keep a trace of their “past” in a more youthful state? Do iPSCs harbor an aged-related epigenetic memory which may impact their differentiation potential? This project will address directly these questions using iPSCs reprogrammed from somatic cells of different ages (20 to 80 years); and following the specific aims outlined below: Objective 1. To determine the aging clock. We will look the extent to which telomeres are elongated; telomerase activity is reconstituted; and mitochondria are reorganized in young- and aged-derived iPSCs. Objective 2. To decipher the aged-related epigenetic memory. We will analyse whether cell reprogramming maintains some specific epigenetic hallmarks of aging in iPSCs. Objective 3. To investigate iPSC differentiation potential. We will test the functional properties of young- and aged-derived iPSCs to differentiate into neurons.

32455,Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cellular reprogramming,The pioneer transcription factors Oct4; Sox2; Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) can reprogram any somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Since this breakthrough discovery; the molecular basics of the process are still not fully understood. The activity of pioneer transcription factors differs from that of conventional transcription factors as they bind directly to heterochromatin and trigger chromatin remodeling events leading to the opening of the chromatin. Important questions remain to be addressed to fully understand reprograming: is a specific expression level of these factors required to elicit the reprogramming process? How do these transcription factors have the ability to engage their target sites to open the chromatin? What genes are essential for engaging the lineage conversion? This project will address directly these questions following the specific aims outlined below: Objective 1. To determine the expression level of pioneer factors required to elicit the reprogramming. Using a OSKM polycistronic IRES-GFP construct; we will investigate whether a specific threshold is necessary to engage the reprogramming process. Objective 2. To identify the chromatin regulators associated with the pioneer transcription factors. We will determine whether the pioneer OSKM factors interact with specific chromatin-modifying enzymes and analyze the downstream events by ATAC-seq and epigenomic profiling. Objective 3. To investigate the genomic sites targeted by OSKM factors. We will perform ChIP-seq to decipher the gene regulatory network triggering the reprogramming process.

32456,Enhancing nerve regeneration using scaffold biomaterials,The peripheral nervous system (PNS) has the unique ability to regenerate damaged axons and rebuild functional connections. This functionality of the SNP relies on Schwann cells. However; functional recovery after nerve injury is generally poor in humans; as regeneration is usually limited to a few millimeters. The use of nerve guiding conduits (NGCs) was developed to bridge severed nerves and encourage axonal regeneration. Nevertheless; the current options are not optimal from a topological; mechanical and biological point of view to promote the growth of axons over long distances. We have developed a new biocompatible NGC with improved mechanical properties. Our general objective is to evaluate the potential of this microstructured biomaterial to improve nerve regeneration.

32466,CLEAN PLANT EXTRACTION SEQUENCING DIAGNOSTICS (CLEANSED) FOR CLEAN GRAPEVINES IN CANADA,Grapevine virus disease management has been identified by the grape grower and wine industries as a top priority for long‐term sector sustainability. Losses of over $23 million per year are currently incurred by grape growers due to reduced yield of infected grapes and increased fruit rejection by wineries. To replace the currently infected acreage and meet ongoing renewal of vineyards the industry needs access to 6.7 million domestically produced; virus free vines/year. There will be two separate pathways for implementation and commercialization. To accommodate these demands; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Sidney Centre for Plant Health (CPH) requires a rapid; cost effective genomic solution to replace the over 30 molecular and bioassays currently performed on ; which can take up to three years to complete. By implementing a high throughput sequencing method at the CFIA the costs of analysis will be reduced and analysis time will be reduced for industry priority varieties imported into Canada as well as audit testing from certified foreign sources destined to commercial planting. Reducing the testing time to 10 days allows grape growers to rapidly improve the health of their vineyards. Domestically; the Canadian Grape Certification Network (CGCN) is commercializing high throughput sequencing through its partner Cool Climate and Oenology Viticulture Institute for the certification of propagation material in nurseries and grapevines obtained through CPH; and for monitoring of production vineyards.,SudarsanaPoojari,Ontario,Brock University,English,2024-07-01,molecular virology; plant virology; bioinformatics,None

32469,Smart bioinspired nanoparticles for crossing biological barriers,Despite the growing attempts to develop numerous nanoparticles for medical applications; limited impact was witnessed at the clinical level. This is due to the inconsistent behavior of developed nanoparticles once they are administered inside the body. This behavior is closely related to the change in surface properties of nanoparticles on their interaction with biological compounds found in the body such as proteins present in the blood. This would possibly result in a complete change of their engineered properties previously optimized on the bench. Several research groups are working to analyze the chemical components deposited on the surface of the nanoparticles once injected in the body. Yet; there is an inability to define the attributes and behaviours of these nanocomposites (nanoparticles with adsorbed plasma proteins) within the different biological environments. Understanding the behavior of these nanocomposites throughout their journey inside the body is the bottle-neck for future development of new generation of nanoparticles that can efficiently deliver drugs and diagnostic molecules to target sites of the body.,HagarLabouta,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,A Master's or a Bachelor student in life sciences; pharmacy; biomedical engineering or a similar field.

32475,Unconventional RNA editing machinery,Our laboratory is investigating a unicellular eukaryote; known as Diplonema papillatum; because it carries out RNA editing and splicing in ways not observed in other organisms. Our general goal is to discover novel molecular mechanisms to enhance the molecular toolbox to be employed in diverse research fields from synthetic biology to medicine and environmental science. In Diplonema mitochondria; massive RNA editing takes place. The pre-RNAs undergo nucleotide substitutions [Cytosine-to-Uracil (C-to-U) and Adenosine-to- Inosine (A-to-I)] as well as additions of multiple Us. We discovered in the nuclear genome sequence a gene that is a good candidate for catalyzing the substitutions: a particular deaminase; called PPR-deaminase (PPRD); that is translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. We postulate that the PPRD; which is part of a novel multi-protein complex called 'editosome'; is a unique editing enzyme able to catalyze conversion of both C-to-U and A-to-I. Therefore; we isolated by immunoprecipitation a multi-protein complex that includes PPRD and determined the protein partners within this complex by mass spectrometry. The project proposed here aims at the further characterization of the postulated editosome by a complementary procedure leveraging covalent labeling by special biotin tags of all partners in proximity of the PPRD inside living Diplonema cells; which will subsequently allow us to purify the labeled partners. The particular objectives are: (i) identify the protein components of the editosome using this independent approach not requiring antibodies; (ii) determine if the editosome contains other molecules such as RNAs or DNAs; and if so; sequence them.,GertraudBURGER,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-06,basic molecular biology of proteins; RNAs; and DNAs (such as extraction; electrophoretic separation; blotting techniques),None
32476,Detecting AI-Generated Health Misinformation on Social Media: A Cross-Cultural Project,Generative AI possesses the potential to serve as a significant tool for ordinary citizens; enabling them to create a vast array of digital content. However; it poses a major challenge: exacerbating the spread of misinformation. As Generative AI advances; it can produce highly realistic and convincing content; potentially misused to disseminate misinformation. This can sway public opinions and undermine trust; particularly when the source of the content—human or AI—is indistinguishable. The primary objective of this research project is to design a system that employs machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately; swiftly; and systematically detect AI-generated health-related misinformation on social media platforms. This system will leverage a combination of classification algorithms; sentiment analysis; and deep learning models to process and analyze social media data in English (Canada) and Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). The choice of these two languages ensures broad cultural representation; encompassing both Western and Eastern contexts. The respective political and legal environments in these jurisdictions; characterized by free speech and robust legal protections; offer a conducive setting for this research.

32477,Exploring the Prediction of Stakeholder Satisfaction via Universities' Social Media Reputation Amid Crisis Periods: A Generative AI-Based Approach,This research project seeks to bridge the gap between informal social media feedback and formal measures of university experience amid crisis periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic; social media platforms serve as key channels for feedback; impacting universities' reputations. However; few studies link this feedback to formal measurements from national student experience surveys. The research methodology of this project involves 1) creating and utilizing a generative AI-based tool for swift and accurate sentiment interpretation from social media feedback about universities during 2020 - 2023; and 2) correlating this feedback with national university experience surveys' results in Canada; the US; and the UK through regressional analysis. The implications of our research are far-reaching. University reputation significantly impacts student recruitment; public support; and international development. During crises; anecdotal social media commentaries become more salient as a source of insights for higher education institutions' reputation management efforts. By highlighting the potential correlations between social media feedback and national survey results; the research can inform strategies to proactively address issues reflected in survey results; improve student experiences; and better manage institutional reputations. This project will also offer insights into the validity and reliability of national surveys during crisis periods and highlight the potential of social media as a triangulation tool for said surveys.,WillZhao,Ontario,University of Waterloo,English,2024-06-17,This project requires students with: - Data Science & NLP Understanding: A strong understanding of data science and NLP; as the project involves developing and applying a generative AI tool for sentiment analysis. - Social Media Analysis: Experience in analyzing social media data; managing unstructured data; and extracting insights.

32478,Deep learning for integrating multimodal data for precision medicine,Omics data refers to the high-dimensional and highly correlated data from genomics; transcriptomics; microbiome; metabolomics; and proteomics. Different computational and statistical analyses of these data can be used to identify risk factors for different diseases or to build autonomous disease prediction models. Analysis of omics data; imaging; and medical health records has become very popular in disease studies because such analysis is helpful to predict whether a patient has a certain disease or not. It is expected that integration of knowledge from multiple data sources measured on the same individuals should improve the prediction performance of patients with chronic diseases. Because one of these data sources may have biological knowledge that is absent in another one. However; due to the high-dimensional nature of the data sets with hundreds of thousands of variables and very small numbers of samples; traditional machine learning approaches (e.g. Support Vector Machines) have limitations to analyze these data efficiently. To overcome these limitations; the project will apply deep learning algorithms to learn knowledge from multiple data sources (omics; imaging; medical health records; etc.) at different feature levels; which will be used to predict disease outcomes and potential drug targets for the diseases. Specifically; the project will have these two objectives: 1) Apply deep learning algorithms to learn knowledge across data sources at a single feature level. 2) Apply transfer learning algorithms to learn knowledge across feature levels.

32479,Deep learning models for drug design,Traditional drug development strategy is costly; tiresome; and labor-intensive. In the last decade; artificial intelligence (AI) based deep learning (DL) technology has shown promising results to overcome some of these limitations. However; rapid DL- based development of de novo drugs with desire properties (Absorption; Distribution; Metabolism and Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET)) remains a challenging task.

32480,Welfare and management of riding lesson horses,In 2010 over $400 million was spent on riding lessons in Canada with a growing demand. Over 10;000 lesson horses are in use in Ontario. Despite playing a key role; lesson horses are often subject to poor welfare conditions such as overuse; improperly fitted equipment and inadequate turnout. This impacts their mental and physical well-being with downstream financial; health and social consequences for both horses and humans. Live observations of lesson horse facilities will examine the influence of management practices on stress-related behaviours during riding lessons. At least 23 lesson barns will be visited to collect information on housing; turnout; workload and tack used during lessons. Horses will be individually assessed in a minimum of four separate riding lessons. Video footage will be taken before and after a lesson while being groomed and tacked up or untacked; and while being ridden to examine body condition score; heart rate; eye blink rate; rein tension and frequency of conflict behaviours. This information will allow us to examine relationships between husbandry practices and indicators of stress during working lessons. Lesson horses are the foundation of all areas of the horse industry and play a key role in human physical and mental health.

32487,Machine Learning for CyberSecurity,The modern world relies heavily on the correct operation of communication networks in general and the Internet in particular. Rogue actors regularly attempt to disrupt such networks; comprising confidentiality; availability; and/or the integrity of essential information. They are motivated by monetary gains (blackmailing the owners or operators of compromised systems) or political considerations (see Ukraine; Estonia; Georgia; etc.). Organizations and governments are therefore interested in hardening their systems; both by learning about possible attack vectors; and suitable defenses. This is typically expressed as a “game” between teams of “red agents” attacking a network and “blue agents” defending a network; ensuring continued operation and protection of confidential data. Traditionally; testing a network and hardening its defenses was a very labor-intensive process; with human teams playing the role of red and blue agents. Machine Learning has shown great promise to automate tasks that otherwise would require significant human insight/intelligence: image recognition; language translation; etc. Consequently; researchers have started to explore the capability of Machine Learning (ML) in the realm of cyber security. In our work; in close collaboration with a local government research lab and local industry; we are working toward building a training environment for such agents. An ideal training environment should have the following features: 1. It efficiently trains agents. 2. The agents are able to perform without change in a real network scenario. 3. Trained agents should perform (reasonably well) not only on a network for which they were trained; but also for networks that are similar (transfer learning). Students involved in this project will work on aspects of this overall project.

32491,Characterization of unaffected shoulder motion in upper limb prosthesis users,Body-powered prostheses are commonly used by individuals with upper limb loss. Since they are controlled using active body movements via a harness and cable system; much of the function of the affected arm is transferred to the unaffected arm. These movement changes may lead to increased pain and overuse in the unaffected shoulder. In spite of this; it is unknown how movement of the unaffected shoulder compares to that of the affected shoulder and to that in non-disabled individuals. The first objective is to compare the three-dimensional shoulder kinematics between unaffected and affected limbs during two standardized unilateral tasks when performed by individuals with a body-powered prosthesis. The second objective is to compare the three-dimensional shoulder kinematics of the unaffected limb in these prosthesis users to the kinematics of the non-task performing shoulder in non-disabled individuals. The trainee’s first task will be to become familiar with previously collected motion capture data for non-disabled and prosthesis user participants. The trainee’s subsequent tasks will include pre-processing the data; preparing the data for kinematic analysis; and analyzing the data. Three-dimensional shoulder kinematics will be calculated using the previously developed software Gaze and Movement Assessment (GaMA). Range of motion and peak angle measures will be extracted for three-dimensional shoulder kinematics for the unaffected limb and statistically compared to the affected shoulder in prosthesis users as well as to the non-task performing shoulder in non-disabled individuals.

32493,A real-time system for triggering muscle stimulation based on EMG measurements,Devices using functional electrical stimulation (FES) have been successful in re-training hand function following spinal cord injury and stroke. However; triggering of FES is still rudimentary: it is triggered by tapping the stimulation device with the other hand or by moving the head. In this context; current stimulation devices would highly benefit from a design feature that triggers FES based on the user's muscle activity. Such biofeedback would allow seamless and effortless triggering of stimulation. It has also been shown to be an effective therapy modality to re-teach function after neural injury. In this project; we aim to develop a prototype for triggering FES based on electromyography (EMG) measurements. Specific aims are to: 1) Identify potential strategies for triggering FES based on EMG measurements; both in terms of hardware requirements and EMG processing algorithms; 2) Develop a real-time; microcontroller-based environment (e.g.; Arduino) for EMG-based triggering of FES; and 3) Test and characterize different EMG processing algorithms when triggering FES. Using previous work on real-time EMG processing; the main objectives are to ensure accurate; robust; and real-time delivery of the FES trigger while minimizing costs. This project is expected to benefit the Canadian industry and healthcare system. It will also allow us to train future biomedical engineers in biomedical instrumentation; real-time control; and bio-signal processing.,AlbertVette,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-20,The student should have a background in Mechanical; Computer; Electrical; or Biomedical Engineering - or any related field.

32494,Quantitative assessment of unstable sitting control using a smart balance board,Balance problems are very common post-stroke. In the early stages of stroke recovery; people are often unable to stand; which limits a therapist’s ability to assess the effects of stroke on balance control and predict future capacity for independent mobility. Motivated by its prognostic relevance; also upper body control during sitting has been used to assess balance impairments post-stroke. While the ability to sit can be assessed very early in the rehabilitation phase; maximal sitting balance scores are oftentimes observed; resulting in a major ceiling effect. One possibility to avoid floor or ceiling effects is to assess a modified sitting posture using a novel sitting paradigm that is safe; but more challenging than conventional sitting. For this purpose; we developed and validated an instrumented (smart) wobble board capturing its tilt angles during unstable sitting. Our objective is to implement the smart wobble board in a clinical setting and validate the obtained kinematic data. I) The trainee's first task will be to embed the smart wobble board into an existing test environment. More specifically; the trainee will need to synchronize the smart wobble board with other experimental equipment and develop a software interface; allowing the user to store and visualize the acquired tilt angles on a tabloid. II) The trainee’s second task will be to validate the kinematic data. First; tilt angles during unstable sitting will be cross-checked against those obtained via a conventional motion capture system. Second; mechanistic measures of postural steadiness; obtained from the tilt angles; will be compared between non-disabled young individuals and non-disabled elderly individuals. Third; the reliability of the obtained measures will be explored by having half of the non-disabled study participants return for a second assessment session. The trainee will execute the experiments; assess kinematic validity; and identify differences between the age groups.,AlbertVette,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-20,The student should have a background in Mechanical; Computer; Electrical; or Biomedical Engineering - or any related field.

32495,Validation of an ankle torque sensor to quantify force generation dynamics,Recent developments in the field of neurorehabilitation suggest that functional electrical stimulation (FES) may have the potential to facilitate standing and walking in people with spinal cord injury. However; the time delay from muscle stimulation to torque generation (= torque generation delay) might threaten postural stability and needs to be accounted for by envisioned closed-loop FES control strategies. In order to determine the torque generation delay for one of the most critical joints during stance control; the first objective of this project is to develop a load cell-based sensor device that can measure isometric ankle torques at different joint angles. The second objective is to use the sensor in healthy individuals to quantify the torque generation delay as a function of muscle activation frequency and amplitude. The obtained results will enhance our knowledge on torque generation delays and assist in developing better control strategies for neuroprostheses.,AlbertVette,Alberta,University of Alberta,English,2024-05-20,Preferably; applicants should have a background in Mechanical; Computer; Electrical; or Biomedical Engineering (or related field).

32496,What gene should be targeted to kill cancer cells?,In an effort to facilitate development of anti-cancer drugs directed at specific molecules; we have turned to exploiting the interactions between gene pairs that can cause lethality. Particularly; we take advantage of an approach called Synthetic Dosage Lethality (SDL); where an overexpression of a gene is lethal only when another; normally non-lethal; mutation/deletion is present. Since cancer cells often overexpress genes due to the effect of gene amplification; or other epigenetic modifications; discovering SDL interactions could reveal new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Importantly; normal cells would be unaffected as the gene whose expression is lost; is not essential for its survival. We use the genome-wide pooled shRNA gene knockdown technology as well as genome-wide; pooled CRISPR system to systematically probe ~18;000 human genes to identify SDL interactions. Using this information; we aim to build a genetic map; akin to the “Google Map” of the cancer cells and design novel cancer therapeutics. Havent heard of CRISPRs? Come chat with me or just google CRISPR. Bottomline; our unbiased approach to query every single gene in the human genome to find what genes become essential for the survival of the tumor cells will potentially identify a target to kill cancer cells. We now have a few potential candidates that we are testing using the CRISPR technology. Your role will be to take a potential candidate gene and test if loss of function of this gene sensitizes the malignant cells.,FrancoVizeacoumar,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-06,All that is required of the student is the motivation.

32498,Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Routing Anomalies,The long-term objectives of my research program are to develop new algorithms for information routing in complex networks; such as the Internet. Of particular interest is to advance theory and understand the underlying behavior of the complex system representing a packet network based on empirical traffic data collected from communication networks. The program encompasses: analysis of data collected from deployed networks; characterization and modeling of network traffic anomalies; and novel algorithms for routing protocols in complex data networks. Formal analytical and statistical methods and machine learning tools for traffic characterization and estimation of network performance are being developed. A library of new tools and models is made available to the research community. My projects deal with detecting routing anomalies that affect BGP performance. Examples of these anomalies are worms such as Slammer (January 25; 2003); Nimda (September 18; 2001); Code Red (July 19; 2001) and ransomware WannaCrypt (May 2017) and WestRock (January 2021). BGP anomalies also include Internet Protocol (IP) prefix hijacks; miss-configurations; and electrical failures such as Moscow blackout (May 25; 2005) and Pakistan power outage (January 22; 2021). We use statistical (Hidden Markov and Naive Beyes models) and machine learning techniques to classify and detect network traffic anomalies and intrusions. Machine learning algorithms under consideration include Support Vector Machine; Recurrent Neural Networks (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)); and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) (XGBoost; LightGBM; and CatBoost) algorithms. Effect of feature selection algorithms on the accuracy of the classifiers is also of importance to developing the best performing models.

32499,Homotopy Methods for Circuit Simulations,Finding a circuit’s dc operating points and its periodic steady-state are very important to the IC design community. The SPICE simulator can be used to find the steady-state response of circuits only by performing transient analysis over a long period of time and the designer needs to ensure that the circuit settles into its periodic steady-state. This approach is often inefficient and; in some cases; not suitable for simulating RF circuits. Therefore; the periodic steady-state circuit response is simulated directly using either the time-domain Newton-Raphson shooting method or the frequency-domain harmonic-balance method. The time-domain Newton-Raphson shooting method is preferred for simulating highly nonlinear circuits. However; an appropriate set of initial conditions is required for its convergence. This is a challenging problem when simulating oscillators; where the period of oscillations is not known a priory. Homotopy methods are robust and accurate numerical techniques for solving nonlinear algebraic equations. These methods have been used to find dc operating points of nonlinear circuits (HomSPICE) and for their steady-state analysis (HomSSPICE). The initial implementations proved promising for finding periodic steady-state solutions of non-autonomous and autonomous circuits that could not be otherwise simulated. HomSPICE and HomSSPICE are derived from SPICE and HOMPACK (a numerical package that implements homotopy algorithms). HomSSPICE is a tool for exploring the use of globally convergent homotopy algorithms for the periodic steady-state analysis of both autonomous and non-autonomous circuits. The simulator is shown to have robust convergence for a variety of sinusoidal oscillators. The proposed project deals with using homotopy and continuation methods to solve differential algebraic equations emanating from analysis of electric circuits. HomSSPICE and HomSPICE software packages employing these methods have not been made publicly available. We are interested in completing the new generation of these tools and releasing them to the research community.

32500,Wildfire smoke infiltration inside buildings,Air pollution causes 15;300 premature deaths every year in Canada; but this number could be increasing due to stronger; more numerous and more frequent wildfires; especially in Western Canada. While we have minimal control over outdoor air pollution during wildfire smoke events; personal and collective building management practices; including manual (e.g.; closing windows and doors) and more sophisticated interventions (e.g.; HVAC systems; portable air cleaners); could drastically reduce infiltration of wildfire smoke inside buildings. This research project entails an extensive data collection of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations outdoor and indoor residential and infrastructure buildings in Victoria; BC; and Edmonton; AB. Indoor-outdoor ratio will be analyzed to identify the amount of PM2.5 entering those buildings. Building configurations (e.g; HVAC parametrization; age; window types) will be considered to explain differences in infiltration of PM2.5.

32501,Microbial bioremediation of oilsands mine tailings,This project will examine bacterial communities in tailings ponds in the Alberta oilsands. The oilsands are one of the world's largest petroleum reserves; but the oil is highly degraded and viscous; making it difficult to extract. The chemical extraction procedures produce a large amount of toxic fluid waste or tailings; which are stored in engineered tailings ponds. The major environmental problems associated with these ponds are that they contain a large amount of biotoxic organic compounds that should not be released to natural water systems; and that they produce large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The goals of our research program are: 1) To assess the coupled processes of methane production and methane oxidation in tailings ponds with molecular microbiology methods 2) To determine how methane emissions might be minimized from these systems 3) To determine if methane-eating or methanotrophic bacteria contribute to bioremediation.

32503,Reading Leigh Hunt Anew,James Henry Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) was one of the most prolific and influential writers on British culture and politics in the first half of the nineteenth century. He was an essential member of the literary circle that included Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley; Charles Lamb; William Hazlitt; Lord Byron; and John Keats; and he knew everyone from William Wordsworth and Henry Crabb Robinson to Charles Dickens and Thomas Carlyle. "Reading Leigh Hunt Anew" will investigate in great depth Hunt's interactions and networks. Because Hunt's career involved a number of literary and political circles and genres which are usually treated in isolation; a new study of the range of his critical work during his career will provide valuable insight into the links between the Romantic and Victorian movements and the growth of an expanded and more socially diversified audience for critical essays and serious literary journalism. Although he is now most often remembered as the editor of the radical weekly newspaper "The Examiner" (1808--22) and the leader of the 'Cockney School of Poetry'; Hunt's contribution to Romantic literature was as wide-ranging as it has proven to be durable; in matters as various as prosodic experimentation and the modernization of the magazine essay. "Reading Leigh Hunt Anew" consists of two tightly interrelated projects on Hunt; one of the key figures of the Romantic period in England; known for his work as editor; journalist; poet; and facilitator. The first is an online database devoted to Hunt's critical writings called "The Leigh Hunt Archive"; which will enhance accessibility and usability of Hunt's works (along with an experimental exhibition component). The second part of this research program is a new book entitled "Reading Leigh Hunt's Critical Essays Anew through Digital Humanities Tools".,MichaelSinatra,Québec,Université de Montréal,English,2024-05-01,Students should have a background in literary studies; and/or some technological knowledge in digital humanities.

32505,Formulation and characterization of hybrid nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery of messenger RNA,Although vaccines prevent millions of infections every year; the development of new effective vaccines against global killers like AIDS; tuberculosis (TB); and COVID-19 is challenged by the demand for induction of cell-mediated and mucosal immunity to protect the host; e.g.; CD8+ T cells that can kill infected cells at mucosal sites of pathogen entrance. Most licensed vaccines are administered by injection and protect the host exclusively via induction of antibody (Ab) responses in the blood; but they do neither induce cell-mediated nor mucosal immunity. A revolutionizing novel approach is to vaccinate with in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA carrying the molecular instructions for in situ synthesis of antigenic protein directly in the host. This versatile vaccination technology induces both strong Ab and cellular immune responses but depends fully on delivery technologies to transport mRNA across the cell membrane to ribosomes in the cytosol. However; the design criteria for a multifunctional and safe mRNA delivery system that delivers mRNA to the cytosol and concomitantly induces protective mucosal CD8+ T cell immunity are elusive. Hence; the purpose of the project is to decode these highly fundamental design criteria. To this end; we have invented a unique RNA delivery technology based on lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (hybrid LPNs) with an unprecedented ability to deliver nucleic acids to the cytosol. In addition; we have identified molecular components (immunostimulating compounds) needed to induce strong CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. We hypothesize that these hybrid systems both deliver mRNA encoding antigen and induce T cell responses in the airway mucosa; which is the site of infection for several respiratory pathogens. We will use microfluidics manufacturing to precisely control the particle properties and to ensure the scalability of the production process.,AneeshThakur,Saskatchewan,University of Saskatchewan,English,2024-05-01,1.

32506,Tangible user interface for hand washing exergame,Reminiscence Therapy (RT) is a non-pharmacological treatment focused on helping individuals with dementia to recollect memories through their senses. Traditionally; the therapy has relied on multimedia where caregivers choose videos; pictures; and audio files. Since cross-sensory stimuli play an important role during RT; the use of tangible user interfaces resembling daily activities such as hand-washing that can be reused for other activities (e.g.; cooking; gardening) adds more immersion when combined with audiovisual feedback from a computer interactive media application (e.g.; a game; exergame; or serious game) using standard monitors or virtual reality headsets. This project focuses on prototyping a tangible user interface that will allow for circular and linear movements to enable user interactions integrated into a handwashing exergame. Off-the-shelf virtual reality and computer input devices typically comprise mouse/keyboard; gamepads; and virtual reality controllers; interfaces that lack proper representation of daily tasks and can greatly impact the user experience by reducing the cognitive load required to operate them.,Alvaro JoffreUribe Quevedo,Ontario,Ontario Tech University,English,2024-05-01,Programming and makerspace skills are highly appreciated.

32507,Analytical modeling of timber-concrete composite structures,Timber-concrete composite (TCC) is an innovative and high-performance construction material which combines the best properties of timber and concrete. Using shear connectors; the two dissimilar materials work together as a whole; resulting in enhanced features such as higher stiffness and load-carrying capacity; reduced vibration; and improved acoustic and thermal properties. Some of the applications of this innovative material in structural engineering are renovation and strengthening of old timber structures; construction of modern mid-rise buildings; and construction of mid- to short-span bridges. Proper design and performance assessment of TCC systems require development of accurate analytical tools applicable to different structural elements; shear connector configurations; and loading conditions. The existing analytical procedures are mostly based on 1D beam models in which the composite behaviour is oversimplified; or use 3D models which are computationally expensive and require extensive calibrations. More importantly; the existing methods are mainly focused on the flexural response of TCC systems and neglect the shear behaviour which in some cases can result in catastrophic failures. The objective of this research project is to develop a unique analytical procedure for TCC systems which can overcome the above-mentioned limitations. With this procedure; the composite behaviour will be represented by coupling a well-recognized rotating crack model for reinforced concrete with a fixed-orthotropic material model for wood. Special considerations will be given to properly model the effects of interfacial slip between the two materials. The new hybrid (rotating-fixed) analytical procedure will be implemented in a three-dimensional finite element analysis tool previously developed for reinforced concrete structures. The effectiveness of the proposed analytical procedure will be verified by modelling a wide range of timber-concrete composite specimens reported in the literature. The Globalink student will be working with graduate students in the development; implementation; and verification of the new hybrid model.,VahidSadeghian,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,1) Highly motivated to work on research topics related to structural engineering. 2) Strong academic background specially in structural analysis and design courses. 3) Strong English language skills. 4) Having critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.,None
32508,Development of sustainable earthquake-resistant 3D printed concrete buildings,3D printed concrete (3DPC) has the potential to revolutionize construction practice by using robotic technology to automate construction. With this novel technique; concrete is precisely placed in thin stacked layers using a computer-controlled extruder to build up a structure. This technique saves time and money; increases worker safety; and provides more design flexibility. Similar to any other new technology; 3DPC presents new challenges that need to be addressed before it can be utilized on a large scale by the industry. One major challenge is the lack of knowledge on the performance and safety of 3DPC buildings under natural hazards including earthquakes. The existing analytical and experimental studies on the structural performance of 3DPC are very limited and do not provide information on the response of 3DPC structures under complex loading conditions (e.g.; dynamic loading). Considering the vulnerability of our communities to earthquakes; it is extremely important to thoroughly assess and improve the seismic safety of 3DPC structures. A collaborative research program is currently underway between Carleton University; IIT Madras and IIT Guwahati to develop sustainable seismic-resistant 3DPC buildings by conducting experimental testing and computer simulations. 3DPC structural specimens with different concrete mix designs and reinforcing methods will be tested to develop structural designs that; for the first time; are resilient against earthquake loading. This will be done using innovative hybrid simulation methods (combining computer modelling with physical test specimens) and shake table tests. Using the test results; analytical models for predicting the response of 3DPC buildings will be calibrated and verified. These analytical models will then be used to conduct parametric studies to better understand the influence of each design variable on the structural response. The Globalink student will be helping graduate students to conduct experimental tests; calibrate and verify analytical models; and perform parametric studies on 3DPC structural elements.,VahidSadeghian,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,1) Highly motivated to work on research topics related to structural engineering. 2) Strong academic background especially in structural analysis and design courses. 3) Strong English language skills. 4) Having critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.,None

A local example of a foodborne illness is the 2019 E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in romaine lettuce. Consequently; consumers care about foodborne illnesses and are interested in gathering information after a foodborne illness outbreak to determine the risks associated with consuming said product. Also; consumers have more exposure to information on foodborne illness outbreaks than ever before due to the reach of social media; news popups on smartphones and direct emails from the purchase point (e.g. Superstore) that track purchases using memberships and points cards (e.g.; PC points). The research in this application extends the measure of consumer exposure termed ‘food safety index’ introduced by Camoglu; Serra and Gil (2015) and applied by Durborow; Chung and Kim (2016). An extension is necessary because previous authors incorporate only newspaper coverage. (2) Food Price Inflation: Unlike foodborne illness outbreaks; food price inflation is experienced by everyone. The United States Department of Agriculture reports that food-at-home prices increased by 3.5; 3.5; and 11.4 percent in 2020; 2021; and 2022. The forecast for 2023 is 6.6 percent. These percentages can be compared to the average of 1.69 percent for the decade starting in 2010. This research investigates the price pass-through for the recent period of high inflation and questions whether inflation is equally shared between the farm; wholesale; and retail levels of the vertical supply chain.,JanelleMann,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,An ideal candidate would possess the following skills: Required skills: read; write and speak English; ability to code one or more of Stata; R; Python; Matlab; willingness to learn a new coding language during the internship; work and communicate with a team; attention to detail.

32517,Regulation of oncogenic tyrosine kinase receptors signalling,Signalling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are essential for organogenesis and homeostasis. In humans; activation of RTKs at inappropriate locations or times can have disastrous consequences such as cancer. This has made many RTKs prime targets for drug development. Signals from RTKs are often relayed via effectors containing modular protein binding domains; which are instrumental for the assembly of multidimensional signalling networks. Adaptor proteins are prototypical examples of such effectors. Adaptors serve as hubs to recruit appropriate target proteins and to guide signals along specific pathways. They allow a relatively small number of receptor-ligand combinations to produce a wide range of outcomes depending on cell type and environment. However; the molecular mechanisms underlying such diversity are poorly defined; as it remains unclear how different RTKs share the same adaptor proteins; yet recruit various combinations of regulatory proteins to produce outcomes specific to each RTK. We discovered a novel mechanism by which RTKs terminate downstream signalling while still remaining on the plasma membrane in a catalytically active state (Molecular Cell 2018). We found that this mechanism is independent of receptor recycling and rather involves the direct phosphorylation by RTKs of SH3 domains. This phosphorylation occurs on an evolutionary-conserved Tyr present in the majority of the >250 human SH3s of signalling proteins. This published finding led us to hypothesize that RTKs utilize tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3 domains on downstream effectors to dynamically sculpt the composition of the signalling complexes that they nucleate when activated. The proposed research project will focus on the definition of the selectivity and efficiency of RTKs towards SH3 domains (Nature Communications 2021; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 2022).,NicolasBisson,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The student must have a basic knowledge in biology; with at least some laboratory experience.

32518,Analysis of EPH tyrosine kinase receptor cellular signalling networks using 3D cellular models,Intercellular communication is a critical feature of multicellular organisms. In that respect; cellular response to extracellular stimuli is mediated by signalling pathways that act downstream of transmembrane receptors; such as the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). With 14 members; the Eph family of RTKs (EphR) is the largest in vertebrates. They are divided in two groups; EphA (ten members) and EphB (six members); based on similarity of their extracellular domains that also correspond to their preference for binding the membrane-anchored ligands; the ephrins. EphR-ephrin signalling is important for a variety of biological functions; such as cell adhesion; shape and motility. Most of Eph family receptors are found to be overexpressed or deregulated in a variety of human tumors; especially in the more aggressive and lethal ones. Unfortunately; the complexity of EphR-ephrin signal transduction in normal and cancer cells is far from being understood. The overall goal of the project is to identify new downstream effectors of Eph-ephrin signalling using proteomics and to determine their roles in the regulation of cell adhesion; migration and invasion. This approach will lead to the identification of new key players in Eph-ephrin signalling; as we recently discovered (Cell Reports 2022; Clinical Cancer Research 2023; Cell Reports 2023). This will further provide invaluable insight on the mechanisms by which Eph receptors and ephrin ligands regulate biological function. In the long-term; this work may also lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.,NicolasBisson,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The student must have a basic knowledge in biology; with at least some laboratory experience.

32521,Functional analysis of NCK adaptor proteins as building blocks for cellular signalling,The response of cells to extracellular stimuli is mediated by signalling pathways that act downstream of membrane bound receptors. These pathways are commonly organized through inducible protein-protein interactions and have been highly conserved throughout evolution. Signals from receptors are often relayed through adaptor proteins; which serve as hubs to recruit appropriate target proteins and guide signals to specific cellular pathways. The main goal is this research program is to decipher how normal cells use these adaptor proteins to coordinate specific responses from a given extracellular cue. In the case of tyrosine kinase receptors and phospho-tyrosine signalling; this is exemplified by adaptors composed exclusively of SH2 (Src Homology 2) and SH3 protein interaction domains; such as NCK1 and NCK2. NCK1/2 adaptors mediate the interaction between phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) containing proteins (via their single SH2) and effectors that contain poly-proline motifs (via one of their 3 SH3s). Little is known about NCK1 and NCK2 specificity as both adaptors are generally considered to be indistinguishable. We have shown using protein interaction analyses that NCK1 and NCK2 signalling networks contain both common and unique components (Mol Cell Proteomics 2018). Recently; we have demonstrated that SH3 domain position within their host protein (in particular NCKs) is crucial for their interaction with targets (Nature Communications 2021; Trends in Biochemical Sciences 2022). The proposed project aims at defining how NCK1/2 adaptors achieve specificity towards their targets. The identification and characterization of NCK1- and NCK2-specific targets will be instrumental to understanding how two adaptor proteins that appear identical nevertheless achieve specific functions in multiple aspects of cellular organization. Moreover; our studies will shed new light on SH2 and SH3 domains as protein interaction modules that mediate assembly of signalling complexes; and how they control the coordination of cellular responses.,NicolasBisson,Québec,Université Laval,English,2024-05-13,The student must have a basic knowledge in biology; with at least some laboratory experience.

32522,Investigating Ecology & Population Decline in Seabirds in Quebec, Canada,Seabirds are the most rapidly declining bird group worldwide. Canada; with the longest coastline in the world; hosts significant numbers of seabirds; especially in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Seabirds in the Gulf are exposed to many factors including oil spills; fisheries; chemical/plastic pollution; changing prey stocks and increased predator populations. Over the past two decades; numbers have declined across the Gulf; including in the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve. The research project will focus on understanding the causes of seabird declines by examining demographic rates and movement at-sea from a mixed-species colony in Mingan. Successful candidates will join a multidisciplinary team conducting monitoring of seabird populations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence; Quebec; Canada. Research will be lead by Carter Rouleau (Ph.D. student at McGill University); Dr. Raphael Lavoie (Biologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada); and Dr. Marie-Claude Roy (biologist with Parks Canada). The project is based out of McGill University; but all fieldwork is conducted in Mingan Archipelago National Park; along the northern shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Our team is involved in a number of long-term monitoring and conservation initiatives within the park; including movement tracking; ecotoxicological analysis; and the use of artificial nesting structures. These monitoring techniques are applied broadly to the many seabird species that inhabit the islands; but a the team will be focused on some particular research objectives. In 2024; research will primarily focus on two species-specific objectives: use of artificial nesting structures by lesser auks (Alca torda); and an investigation of population decline in black-legged kittiwakes (Lissa tridactyla).,KyleElliott,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-06-03,Ideal candidates for this project will have a background in ecology; environmental biology; or evolutionary biology.

32523,Do plant species that co-occur compete less intensely than those that never co-occur?,Some pairs of plant species are regularly found growing closely (positively co-occurring); while other pairs are never found growing close together (negatively co-occurring). It has been hypothesized that intense competition is what leads to some pairs never being found together. I propose to work with a Mitacs Intern to test this by measuring the intensity of competition experienced by plant species when grown with another species with which they negatively co-occur; as well as the intensity of competition experienced when plant species are grown with a species with which they positively co-occur. If negatively co-occurring pairs of species compete more intensely; this will be consistent with the hypothesis that competition is keeping those pairs of species from being found growing close together in wild plant communities. Competition intensity will be measured in a greenhouse growing experiment; where the intern will grow plants alone and with a competing species (positively or negatively co-occurring). The difference in growth of a plant when growing alone and with another species is an established protocol used to determine the impact of neighbour competition on plant growth.,BrandonSchamp,Ontario,Algoma University,English,2024-05-01,1.

32524,Exploring the Shadow of Resilience: The Negative Effects of Forced Resilience on African Immigrants in the Canadian Labour Market,Resilience; often hailed as a positive and empowering trait; plays a pivotal role in individuals' ability to overcome adversity and achieve their goals. However; the potential negative consequences of forced resilience have received relatively less attention. This research project aims to delve into the dark side of resilience; specifically focusing on African immigrants in Canada. Despite being praised for their resilience; this population faces challenges in integrating into the Canadian labour market and achieving economic stability. By examining the potential harms of excessive reliance on resilience; this study seeks to shed light on how this widely advocated approach may hinder rather than facilitate the success of African immigrants. Through a careful analysis of their experiences and the barriers they encounter; we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding resilience and its impact on marginalized populations. Ultimately; this research calls for a nuanced examination of resilience strategies to ensure a more equitable and effective response to the challenges faced by African immigrants in Canada.,CharlesGyan,Québec,McGill University,English,2024-05-06,The ideal student intern should have a strong research aptitude with some knowledge of research methodologies.

32525,Endosomal sorting regulation by a Rab GTPase,Membrane trafficking is an essential mechanism conserved from yeast to humans; and mutations in a large array of trafficking regulators are associated with human diseases. Endosomal sorting events control the destiny of endocytosed transmembrane proteins by directing them towards either recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation at lysosomes. Sorting events are coordinated by the retromer; the retriever; and the commander complexes. These bind specific cargo to ensure their recycling. All these complexes also associate with the WASH actin polymerization complex to control endosomal F-actin polymerization. Hence; WASH plays a central role in cargo sorting as well. However; how the WASH complex activity is regulated is still an open question. Our laboratory has identified the small GTPase RAB21 as a WASH interactor and a potential modulator of WASH activity. This MITAC internship aims to identify the binding regions between RAB21 and WASH complex subunits through in vitro and in vivo binding assays. Once the interaction sites are mapped; the student will generate binding-deficient mutants and perform localization and functional studies in cells. Together; these experiments will test the relationship between the WASH complex and its new regulator; RAB21.,SteveJean,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,- Wet lab experience. - Cell culture and fluorescent imaging experience is a plus. - Experience with western blotting. - Capacity to perform biochemical experiments (protein interaction mapping; activity assay; etc.) would also be a plus. - Being relatively independent and having initiative. - Motivated,None

Appropriate isolation of these pathogens on selective media (incl. biomedical testing) and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility will be done. Genetic determination of resistance genes will also be performed. Samples will also be collected from healthy horses that do no receive ceftiofur and will be processed in the same manner. Participating horse owners will be briefly queried about their management practices and whether their horse has received antimicrobial treatment in a specified time period prior to sample collection. Complementary to this prospective field study; a retrospective study will be conducted by querying antimicrobial prescribing practices of veterinarians working at the equine clinic.

32530,Correcting for silent data corruptions using structured sparsity and machine learning,With their ever-growing scale and sophistication; modern computational infrastructures are increasingly susceptible to Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs). SDCs are `soft’ faults. They are liable to go unnoticed and propagate across a system; causing significant errors in downstream computations. It is therefore critical to develop new mechanisms to mitigate against SDCs in large infrastructures. The goal of this project is to develop new theoretical foundations and novel state-of-the-art algorithms for tackling SDCs in scientific computing applications. We will interpret SDCs as intrinsically low-dimensional objects embedded in high-dimensional spaces - namely; those living on or close to certain nonlinear manifolds. This powerful lens through which to view corruptions opens the door to using sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques to deal with them. This work will combine ideas from sparse modelling; high-dimensional geometry; compressed sensing; continuous optimization; machine learning and deep learning to this end. We will first develop new mathematical models for SDCs and then use these to design a new generation of fast; reliable; scalable and theoretically guaranteed algorithms for SDC detection and mitigation. This project will involve three main objectives: 1) New; structured sparse models for SDCs with associated theoretical guarantees. In this objective we will develop and study new ways to model SDCs that refine existing low-dimensional models. 2) New algorithms for detecting and mitigating SDCs based on fast; scalable first-order optimization methods. Having obtained new models in 1); in this objective we will look at how to exploit such models through structured regularization and fast optimization algorithms. 3) Novel; robust; data-driven SDC algorithms based on deep learning with breakthrough performance. Finally; in this objective we will address the case where one has access to historical SDC data. We will use this to design and train effective deep neural networks for accurately and robustly detecting SDCs.,BenAdcock,British Columbia,Simon Fraser University,English,2024-05-01,This project will involve a combination of mathematics and programming.

32531,Genetic interactions between autophagy and various signaling pathways in the intestine,The intestinal epithelium constantly faces various types of stress from ingested food. Mutations in genes regulating the process of autophagy are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Autophagy is defined as the lysosomal degradation and recycling of cytosolic components. Our laboratory uses Drosophila melanogaster to investigate how autophagic dysfunction affects the gut. We found that autophagic defects lead to increased intestinal inflammation and shorter fly lifespan. Using an unbiased genetic screen; we identified genetic modifiers of loss of autophagy. We now want to characterize the relationship between these pathways and autophagy. In this MITAC internship; the student would perform multiple drosophila crosses to test the impact of co-depletion of autophagy along with specific pathway regulators. Adult fly guts would be dissected and stained with various markers to assess the different cell populations. Stained guts would then be imaged by confocal microscopy; and the image would be analyzed using specific image analysis software. We believe this work will identify pathways that could be targeted in affected individuals to improve intestinal homeostasis.,SteveJean,Québec,Université de Sherbrooke,Either English or French,2024-05-06,- Wet lab experience. - Knowledge of Drosophila genetic. - Knowledge on confocal imaging and image analysis. - Being relatively independent and having initiative. - Motivated,None
32532,Contribution of alternative splicing to myofibroblast,Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism that expands the proteome diversity by allowing the transcription of multiple messenger RNAs from a single gene. Numerous examples have illustrated the functional impact of alternative splicing in the literature. There is also a high level of understanding of the major factors influencing a splicing decision (e.g. RNA sequence in cis and RNA binding factors acting in trans); recently culminating into a "splicing code". However; there is not much known about the upstream mechanisms controlling the expression/activity of splicing factors and even less linking extracellular factors to alternative splicing regulation.

32533,Mécanique des fluides dans les microturbomachines - études expérimentales,The main objective of the project is to experimentally characterize the microturbines we have manufactured. In order to continue their development; we must put the microturbines to the test and measure its performance. We also want to investigate its behavior in order to compare with the predictions made during the design phase. For the aspects that are not predictable; we also want to explore the behavior experimentally to better understand its operation; its limits and the achievable performances. Aspects that can be studied in this way include: low Reynolds number fluid mechanics in turbomachinery (Re<3000); viscous flows in the micropump; compressible flows in hydrostatic and hydrodynamic bearings; heat transfer by conduction and convection; as well as rotor dynamics at the microscopic scale. Many of these aspects remain unexplored to date; given the novelty of millimeter-scale microturbines. At this small scale; it is difficult to insert instrumentation to measure the flow; so we use simulation (CFD) to better understand the internal flows. Experimentally; we measure inlet and outlet values; such as flow rates; pressures; and temperatures; as well as rotor speed and vibrations. To achieve this; we have developed specialized fixtures with control and data acquisition systems for microturbines. The objective of the internship is to conduct experiments to investigate the behavior of the microturbine; including not only the turbomachinery; but also the flows in the pump and bearings. Improvements to the test bench will also be useful to better understand the behavior of the microturbine.

32535,Battery Energy Storage Systems with Modular Multi-Level Converters,Battery energy storage systems are becoming increasingly popular in modern power systems. Connecting a battery energy storage unit to the grid requires a bidirectional; fully controllable converter. Modular multi-level converters (MMCs) are attractive candidates for this purpose as they allow usage of smaller battery units and produce high-quality output waveforms. This project looks at using MMCs for interfacing batteries to the grid and its usage in the context of low-inertia systems.,ShaahinFilizadeh,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,1) Computer simulation of power and power-electronic circuits 2) Hands-on skills with circuits and instrumentation is an asset,None
32536,Evaluation, Refinement, and Application of Crack-based Safety Assessment Models for Concrete Bridges,Most existing bridge inspection guidelines assess damage and degradation severity of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge structures in a highly qualitative manner using visual inspection benchmarks such as measured concrete crack widths and lengths. While visual inspection procedures can provide a great deal of information pertaining to the performance of in-service bridges; the findings from these inspections are somewhat dependent on the experience/interpretations of the inspectors. In recent years; several assessment procedures have been proposed in an effort to use measured concrete cracking to develop objective and quantifiable insight into RC structure performance. However; in most cases these procedures require measured concrete cracks to be discretely modeled within a finite element analysis software which is extremely costly and impractical for real-world assessment. A team of researchers from Carleton University and the University of Waterloo has recently initiated a collaborative research project to develop simple and practical assessment tools to enable engineers to accurately assess the severity of structural damage in concrete bridges based on information measured during visual inspections. The project consists of conducting a comprehensive literature review of existing damage-based evaluation procedures and identifying typical bridge components that would benefit from structural crack evaluation. A visual crack measurement evaluation database recently developed by the research team will be expanded and subsequently utilized to evaluate the performance of the existing crack-based assessment procedures. Based on the findings of the evaluation; a refined crack-based assessment model will be developed and employed to assess the condition of a real RC bridge structure in Canada. The Globalink student will be working with graduate students to carry out the literature review; collect data on the condition of structural components of existing bridges in Canada; expand the visual crack measurement evaluation database; evaluate and refine the crack-based assessment models; and apply the models to real-world structures.,VahidSadeghian,Ontario,Carleton University,English,2024-05-01,1) Highly motivated to work on research topics related to structural engineering. 2) Strong academic background especially in structural analysis and design courses. 3) Strong English language skills. 4) Having critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.,None
32537,Conducting polymer binders in new battery chemistries,Lithium-ion batteries are reaching their intrinsic capacity limit. They are based on lithium intercalation for charge storage; which requires a solid framework host material that can be oxidized and reduced and stores lithium ions reversibly. By reducing the volume and weight of the solid framework; the energy density and specific energy of lithium ions can be increased. However; there is a limit to this optimization. With the newest generation of lithium intercalation materials; structural collapse can be observed upon cycling. Alternative batteries; that could potentially store more than ten times the energy that lithium-ion batteries store; are based on electrochemical reactions that are less reversible than intercalation chemistry. This leads to a strong performance decay with time. The reason for this is often connected to the electrode matrix; that cannot accommodate volume and morphological changes of the charge-storing materials. Our research has discovered new electrode matrices (patent pending) based on conducting polymers and adhesive polyanions. We have demonstrated their ability to serve as complete one-component matrix in lithium-ion batteries. These matrices have the potential to unlock reversible performance of a wide range of new battery chemistries. In this project; you will be applying these new electrode matrices to one of a choice of new battery chemistries: lithium-air; lithium-sulfur; lithium-tin; lithium-silicon; Na-ion; Mg-ion; Ca-ion; Al-ion; Na-sulfur. You will be exploring the stability and chemical interactions of the matrix with its active materials. This is an exciting opportunity to prove that high-performance alternatives to lithium-ion technology are within reach; by optimizing the battery electrode composition and matrix.,ChristianKuss,Manitoba,University of Manitoba,English,2024-05-01,You should have a background in materials chemistry; electrochemistry or functional material engineering and excitement to contribute to solutions to our fossil fuel dependence.,None
32538,Scaling of Solvent Enhanced Oil Recovery Processes using Reservoir Simulation,There has been substantial interest in Alberta in using solvents for oil recovery to minimize the use of steam for in-situ oil/bitumen recovery. Understanding upscaling of solvent processes is still in its infancy as is understanding the mechanistic behavior of solvent recovery from oil/bitumen reservoirs. Reservoir simulation has been used in other processes to study scaling and scaling parameters. This project will begin with a brief literature review of research done in this area. The project entails setting up reservoir simulation models; likely for homogeneous and possibly heterogeneous reservoirs at various scales; and then implementing these simulations using a thermal compositional reservoir simulator; STARS. The principal investigator will aid the student in setting up the simulations unless the student has this expertise. It is likely that the research will focus on gravity drainage processes only. The output from the simulations will be analyzed and compared to determine the scalability of the process. This research will be used to determine the viability of using reservoir simulation to explore the scaling of this process. If time permits; the researchers may further explore the use of externally applied heat to the same reservoirs considered in the earlier part of the study. Also; if time permits; the researchers may explore the effects of various operating parameters; such as injection pressure; production pressure and mass transfer coefficients such as diffusion and dispersion.,ShelleyLorimer,Alberta,MacEwan University,English,2024-05-01,The student should be interested in petroleum engineering; preferably with some background derived from petroleum courses. The student should be comfortable working with a computer and analyzing large amounts of data. The principal investigator is willing to provide some training in reservoir simulation; however; if the student does have some experience in reservoir simulation that will make progress on the project much easier. The student will have to be able to work independently and troubleshoot the running of the computer software. The student should also be familiar with Microsoft Office to write up the results of the analysis.,None
32539,An Investigation of the Scalability of Commercial Solar Panels/Photovoltaic Cells,A brief literature review will be conducted on the scalability of solar panels from small to medium size; to compare the energy that can be generated and used with the long term goal of predicting output from large scale solar projects. Several commercial solar panels will be investigated and data collected in the summer 2024 in Alberta. This particular project will be a continuation of what is perceived to be a longer term project to study the use of solar panels in northern climates. The energy output for these two panels will be recorded for later analysis; along with the "usability" of this technology based on the perceptions of the researchers. These results will be compared to information which is published in the literature to determine the feasibility of using commercial solar panels both from an economic perspective and from individual residential use of this commercial technology. A preliminary research review has suggested that solar energy "might be able to" produce significant amounts (67-100%) of electrical energy in a residential community in Calgary. This research is intended to extend knowledge in this area with a focus on the practical application of existing solar technology.,ShelleyLorimer,Alberta,MacEwan University,English,2024-05-01,The student will need to have a basic understanding of sustainable energy methods. An understanding on the use of solar panels in northern climates would also be beneficial. The student should have a comfort level with a basic programming language.

32540,Multi-junction Third Generation Photovoltaics Technologies,In the past few decades; third generation QDs solar cells (QDSCs) have become the most cost-effective alternatives to commercial silicon solar cells due to their eco-friendly; low-cost materials and simple fabrication process. In particular; QDSCs have the potential to break the Shockley-Queisser limit (33%) of the PCE due to the unique optoelectronic properties of the colloidal QDs as light harvesters. However; the record value of PCE (~16%) for QDSCs is still far from their predicted theoretical efficiency due to the limited range of solar light absorption associated with architectural designs and non-radiative carrier recombination within the device. Therefore; in this project; we aim to develop a multi-junction architecture that covers the solar spectrum light absorbance and optimized layered photoanodes with reduced carrier recombination to reach record-breaking power conversion efficiencies. Although it's quite challenging to design QDs that harvest the solar photons from visible to NIR region. We will resolve this issue by fabricating the photoelectrode by using the specially synthesized colloidal eco-friendly QDs of different sizes (or bandgaps) in a layered configuration and optimizing the device's architectural design. In addition; each layer is precisely designed according to the compatibility of interconnective layers. In this approach; the chemical; thermal and electrical synergy between the two layers will be controlled. These special multi-junction solar cells offer the possibility of achieving the PCE of 42% and 49% for tandem and triple-junction configurations; respectively. The results of this project will bring about a revolutionary transformation in global PV technology by enabling widespread access and easy distribution of low-cost; lightweight solar cells that can be seamlessly bonded to any surface.,Gurpreet SinghSelopal,Nova Scotia,Dalhousie University,English,2024-06-17,The required background of the student is in the field of Materials Science; Chemistry; Electronic Engineering; Physics; and Nanomaterials. Skills in materials preparation and/or characterization and basic courses on nanostructured materials and nanotechnology will help the student in deep understanding all the steps of materials synthesis and characterization. Background in electrochemistry and electro engineering will be more specific of the project related with the operation features of the solar cell and the characterization of its main parameters.,None
32541,The Functional Connectome: Hallucinations and Delusions,The neuroimaging focus of the proposed work will apply advanced multivariate methodology to comprehensive; internationally shared data sets in order to generate new insights into these intermediate networks as they relate to the symptoms of in schizophrenia; thereby contributing to a biological understanding of hallucinations and delusions. Attempts to understand networks must be based on connectivity at some level; and this has led to international efforts to share data in order to define the set of connections in the human brain. This has been coined the Human Connectome Project; where “connectome” refers to the connection matrix of the brain. When the object of study is functional neuroimaging data; this endeavour is referred to study of the functional connectome. Our laboratory has identified task-based functional brain networks; and a subset of these have been involved in all tasks we have analyzed; and we have developed an automated algorithm to classify new networks into these templates. We have also associated a cognitive function with each using powerful methods of combining datasets; and observing activity over a range of cognitive tasks. For example; one network activates during volitional attention to external representations; another during volitional attention to internal representations; one responds to extraction of semantic information (linguistic and other); and another activates when checking/evaluating a previous response. The current project involved a data sharing initiative whereby functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from multiple sites will be simultaneously analyzed to identify functional brain networks underlying hallucinations and delusions. We are also combining fMRI and EEG data in order to identify the overlap between networks involved in both; and which are impaired in schizophrenia.,ToddWoodward,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-06,Computer programming skills/multivariate statistics are not really required for this internship; but are helpful. A desire to learn about and apply these methods to the study of human behaviour is required. Valuable skills that would provide an excellent starting point for a career in cognitive neuroscience research will be obtained. However; plenty of opportunities also exist for students advanced in computer programming; brain imaging and multivariate statistics. Most importantly; the intern must be easy to get along with; able to work well with a team and be able to find the right balance between working independently and asking for guidance.,None
