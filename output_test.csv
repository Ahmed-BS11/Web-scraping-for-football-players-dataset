31835,Machine learning for functional genomics and protein engineering applications,Such tools can be useful for the assignment of improved functions for orphan genes and sequences for orphan enzymes and for investigating enzyme promiscuity. Hence; there is the potential for the use of new protein language modeling representations using embeddings from natural language. Such improved protein language modeling methods can be valuable for multiple applications including optimizing protein solubility; stability; along with other functional properties of the enzymes such as catalytic activity and affinity. Finally; such protein language modeling methods will be valuable to engineer novel enzymes by combining it with existing experimental techniques such as directed evolution.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology; biochemistry and machine learning. The undergraduate program can be in computer science of engineering and the student will have experience with bioinformatics and genome sequence analysis. The student must be willing to learning techniques and work with senior researchers in order to execute new ideas and algorithms into code and test them out. Finally; the student should be comfortable programming in Python and familiarity with Pytorch and developing code for GPUs.,Preferred student academic background
31836,Synthetic Biology for Metabolic Engineering of Chemicals from Biomass-based Feedstocks,Further; increased volatility in the petrochemical feedstocks has necessitated a paradigm shift towards the use of biomass based feedstocks for the synthesis of transportation fuels. Consequently; there have been intense academic and corporate research efforts for the design of microbial strains for the production of ethanol; butanol; fatty acid methyl esters and isoprenoids as biofuels. In contrast; there have been very few instances of microbial strain engineering for large-scale commodity chemicals with the exception of 1;3 propanediol (DuPont); lactic acid (Cargill); and 1;4 butanediol (Genomatica). A common feature among all of these chemicals is that they are derived primarily from central metabolism. The success of these efforts clearly motivates the microbial strain engineering efforts for other chemicals which are further removed from central metabolism. Recently; the U.S. Department of Energy identified a dozen chemicals with large market demands globally and in North America that could be potentially synthesized from biomass-based feedstocks. These include dicarboxylic acids such as succinic; malic; fumaric; itaconic and adipic acids as well as levulinic acid. In the case of chemicals that are derived from central metabolism such as succinic acid; malic and fumaric acid; metabolic pathways and enzymes for their synthesis are found in typical industrially used hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However; there still remains the challenge of engineering the metabolism of the microbial host so that volumetric productivity; titer; and product yield can be improved for economic viability. In contrast; for chemicals such as adipic acid; the synthesis pathways are not present in typical industrial hosts resulting in an additional challenge for strain engineering. One of the challenges to developing bioconversion technologies for the production of biochemicals is attaining high conversion efficiency from variable sugar streams. A primary goal is to use systems biology methods to design strains.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,Student should be trained in engineering (e.g.; chemical or biochemical engineering) with basic knowledge of biochemistry. He should also know the basics of mathematical modeling and being able to program in MATLAB or Fortran is a plus. Knowledge of bioinformatics is a major plus. Basic experimental skills and interest in learning molecular biology and analytical chemistry tools and other advanced synthetic biology techniques will be a plus.,
31837,Modulating immune response in tumors via nanoparticle drug delivery,Tumor cells secret growth factors; cytokines and chemokines to drive the immune response in the tumor microenvironment towards pro-inflammatory; promoting tumor invasion and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Immuno-modulation of the tumor microenvironment is an attractive strategy for antitumor therapy; but systemic delivery of immunomodulating agents often results in severe side effects. The Li lab plans to develop a nanoparticle system to target an immunomodulating agent to the tumor to re-educate the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that this strategy will reduce the side effects; while exert enhanced anti-tumor immunity.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,1. Background in tumor biology and immunology (e.g. courses or summer project) 2. Cell culture 3. Cell based assays. e.g. MTT/XTT assay and ELISA 4. English proficiency 5. Microsoft Office (Powerpoint; Excel; Word),Preferred student academic background
31838,Genome editing using non-viral nanoparticle delivery,Gene editing provides an alternative treatment for diseases that cannot be cured by conventional therapies. Those challenging diseases include cancer; genetic disorders; and viral infection. The limiting step for gene editing is efficient delivery of genome editing components into the target cells. The delivery system needs to overcome various barriers and release the biological payloads in the target site. The major delivery barriers include rapid enzymatic degradation; renal elimination; efficient uptake by the target cells and release in the desirable subcellular compartment for optimal effect. The Li lab focuses on developing innovative nanoparticle delivery systems that provide stable and efficient encapsulation of gene editing components and target them to specific cells. Ultimately; these nanoparticles will be used to treat genetic disorders in both in vitro and in vivo models.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,1. Background in drug delivery; pharmaceutics or chemical engineering (e.g. courses or summer project) 2. Cell culture 3. Molecular biology assays; such as qPCR; Western blot 4. English proficiency 5. Microsoft Office (Powerpoint; Excel; Word),
31839,Anti-cancer drug design,This project would involve working on one of our cancer drug design and synthesis campaigns. With our partners; we have identified promising new proteins that could be targeted to treat cancer. We have designed new molecules using structural biology and computational chemistry techniques; and are making many new drugs based on this screen. These often have new ring systems and scaffolds that are not found in the literature and we must invent new chemistry to effectively make them. These drugs are then evaluated by our research team in the lab; and we iteratively redesign; and make new generations of the molecules. The project here is for the organic synthesis. If you have wanted to do synthesis for medicinal chemistry; this is the perfect project for you. Unlike most traditional medicinal chemistry; we are not making a lot of similar analogues; we are generating a few more complex scaffolds which we may then derivatize for standard lead exploration.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,
31840,Computational-guided drug design,We are driven by using chemistry to solve questions that arise in biomedicine. This often takes the form of medicinal chemistry where we are looking to make drugs to target specific diseases. As making molecules is expensive; we are using a target-oriented design strategy where we use a combination of structural biology and computational chemistry to study how known molecules interact with a protein target. We are currently using this approach on 7 different targets ranging from new cancer drugs; to autoimmune peptides; to treatments to neutralize antibiotic-resistant bacteria; COVID-19 reasearch; to studying cannabis-protein interactions to better understand the effects of the disease.We then design new molecules based on this information and do computational high-throughput screening to examine which ones we should make in the lab. Computationally; we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations; docking studies; quantum mechanical modelling; and advanced DFT-derived techniques and measurements to understand how molecules interact one with another. We use Gaussian; Amber; Gromacs; Schrodinger; Materials Studio; Rosetta; Autodock Vina and other tools to carry out these analyses. We have extensive supercomputing infrastructure to run these calculations (3600 computer cores); and access to many of the fastest graphics cards for the molecular modelling. The student will be working with the team on one of these projects; all of which have the potential of transforming how we treat disease.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a computational chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The student should have some familiarity with computational chemistry before arriving; but can be taught any of the software they will need. The specific project to be undertaken will be selected both based on the interests and capabilities of the student. Unlike any other MITACS project; the student can continue to collaborate on the science after returning to their home country if they wish. The student will also; ideally; be interested in continuing their studies in graduate school in computational chemistry.,
31841,Macrocyclic Single Molecule Sensors as Diagnostic Tools,We have become very involved in supramolecular chemistry; the chemistry involved when non-covalent bonds provide well-defined structures. We are primarily interested in adapting synthetic chemistry to make previously inaccessible structures with novel activity. This is part of an extensive collaboration with teams in the US; Finland and Switzerland. The project combines developing and using new synthetic organic chemistry with the potential for biophysical and analytical chemistry; or computational and/or materials science training depending on the interests of the applicant. The work will primarily involve the functionalization of aryl groups; post-macrocylization functionalization and elaboration of pillararenes and resorcinarenes. We are then using these for a variety of really neat applications including detecting disease specific molecules (Chemical Science; 2018; 9; 1358-1367); looking to create tools to prevent bacterial growth; and making fundamental discoveries in how molecules form bonds to make large supramoleuclar networks either as crystals (Crystal Growth and Design; 2018; 18; 513-520) or in solution. We are moving into using these systems in live animal models; and in lab-on-a-chip set-ups. The project is a perfect example of our program's philosophy of using synthetic organic chemistry to do more than only total synthesis.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in total synthesis.,
31842,Functional Polymers: Towards highly targeted traceless drug delivery,Self-immolative polymers are degradable polymers whose decomposition needs to be triggered-they are perfectly stable plastics until a specific stimulus is applied. They are different from traditional biodegradable polymers in that degradation takes place in hours rather than months. Our research team is developing a biocompatible scaffold with a high degree of functionalizability that gives our polymers a unique practical flexibility for use in a wide variety of biomedical applications with our partners including drug delivery; diagnostics; medical device preparation; early cancer detection; and for the development of highly innovative "animal-free" assays. This particular project is focused on novel chemistries that will allow for our biocompatible scaffolds to be used in novel drug-delivery applications. We are working towards producing "unbreachable" nano-particles that are completely stable to all conditions except a single target enzyme that is upregulated in certain cancers. The project involves a combination of synthetic chemistry; materials science; bioimaging; and potentially mammalian tissue culture for a highly interdisciplinary experience. This project is advancing very rapidly in our group; and is a highly innovative and competitive research space; and so the exact project will only be decided upon when the student arrives and we agree upon a subject of mutual interest and relevance.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,Ideally we are looking for a synthetic chemist with broad interests in multidiciplinary science. The candidate will have the opportunity to meet and work with our network of local collaborators and experience a variety of different research environments while developing expertise in functional monomer and polymer synthesis.,
31843,3D bioprinting tissues from stem cells,3D printing uses the specifications provided in a digital file to construct 3 dimensional objects and this process can be applied as a method to engineer tissues. The goal of this project is to use biomaterial-based bioinks to print functional 3D neural tissue from stem cells using 3D bioprinting. In particular; we wish to print tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hiPSCs are pluripotent stem cells produced by reprogramming adult cells back into a state where they can form any type of tissue. hiPSC lines derived from a patient could be printed into tissues used for screening potential treatments for their disease. Proper conditions must be met to ensure the printed hiPSCs form the desired type of tissue. During the printing process; cells are contained in "bioink"; the material that surrounds the cells and enables them to be delivered in continuous streams. This project will bioprint tissues from hiPSCs and evaluate their properties. Such engineered tissues could serve as a tool for drug screening.,Stephanie Willerth,British Columbia,University of Victoria,English,2024-05-06,Stem cell culture experience is preferred. Experience working with chemicals and biohazards along with experience immunohistochemistry; real time PCR; and flow cytometry would also be desirable.,
