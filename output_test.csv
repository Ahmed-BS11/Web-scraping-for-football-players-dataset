31835,Machine learning for functional genomics and protein engineering applications,Such tools can be useful for the assignment of improved functions for orphan genes and sequences for orphan enzymes and for investigating enzyme promiscuity. Hence; there is the potential for the use of new protein language modeling representations using embeddings from natural language. Such improved protein language modeling methods can be valuable for multiple applications including optimizing protein solubility; stability; along with other functional properties of the enzymes such as catalytic activity and affinity. Finally; such protein language modeling methods will be valuable to engineer novel enzymes by combining it with existing experimental techniques such as directed evolution.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.

31836,Synthetic Biology for Metabolic Engineering of Chemicals from Biomass-based Feedstocks,Further; increased volatility in the petrochemical feedstocks has necessitated a paradigm shift towards the use of biomass based feedstocks for the synthesis of transportation fuels. Consequently; there have been intense academic and corporate research efforts for the design of microbial strains for the production of ethanol; butanol; fatty acid methyl esters and isoprenoids as biofuels. In contrast; there have been very few instances of microbial strain engineering for large-scale commodity chemicals with the exception of 1;3 propanediol (DuPont); lactic acid (Cargill); and 1;4 butanediol (Genomatica). A common feature among all of these chemicals is that they are derived primarily from central metabolism. The success of these efforts clearly motivates the microbial strain engineering efforts for other chemicals which are further removed from central metabolism. Recently; the U.S. Department of Energy identified a dozen chemicals with large market demands globally and in North America that could be potentially synthesized from biomass-based feedstocks. These include dicarboxylic acids such as succinic; malic; fumaric; itaconic and adipic acids as well as levulinic acid. In the case of chemicals that are derived from central metabolism such as succinic acid; malic and fumaric acid; metabolic pathways and enzymes for their synthesis are found in typical industrially used hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However; there still remains the challenge of engineering the metabolism of the microbial host so that volumetric productivity; titer; and product yield can be improved for economic viability. In contrast; for chemicals such as adipic acid; the synthesis pathways are not present in typical industrial hosts resulting in an additional challenge for strain engineering. One of the challenges to developing bioconversion technologies for the production of biochemicals is attaining high conversion efficiency from variable sugar streams. A primary goal is to use systems biology methods to design strains.,RadhakrishnanMahadevan,Ontario,University of Toronto,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.

31837,Modulating immune response in tumors via nanoparticle drug delivery,Tumor cells secret growth factors; cytokines and chemokines to drive the immune response in the tumor microenvironment towards pro-inflammatory; promoting tumor invasion and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Immuno-modulation of the tumor microenvironment is an attractive strategy for antitumor therapy; but systemic delivery of immunomodulating agents often results in severe side effects. The Li lab plans to develop a nanoparticle system to target an immunomodulating agent to the tumor to re-educate the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that this strategy will reduce the side effects; while exert enhanced anti-tumor immunity.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.

31838,Genome editing using non-viral nanoparticle delivery,Gene editing provides an alternative treatment for diseases that cannot be cured by conventional therapies. Those challenging diseases include cancer; genetic disorders; and viral infection. The limiting step for gene editing is efficient delivery of genome editing components into the target cells. The delivery system needs to overcome various barriers and release the biological payloads in the target site. The major delivery barriers include rapid enzymatic degradation; renal elimination; efficient uptake by the target cells and release in the desirable subcellular compartment for optimal effect. The Li lab focuses on developing innovative nanoparticle delivery systems that provide stable and efficient encapsulation of gene editing components and target them to specific cells. Ultimately; these nanoparticles will be used to treat genetic disorders in both in vitro and in vivo models.,Shyh-DarLi,British Columbia,University of British Columbia,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.

31839,Anti-cancer drug design,This project would involve working on one of our cancer drug design and synthesis campaigns. With our partners; we have identified promising new proteins that could be targeted to treat cancer. We have designed new molecules using structural biology and computational chemistry techniques; and are making many new drugs based on this screen. These often have new ring systems and scaffolds that are not found in the literature and we must invent new chemistry to effectively make them. These drugs are then evaluated by our research team in the lab; and we iteratively redesign; and make new generations of the molecules. The project here is for the organic synthesis. If you have wanted to do synthesis for medicinal chemistry; this is the perfect project for you. Unlike most traditional medicinal chemistry; we are not making a lot of similar analogues; we are generating a few more complex scaffolds which we may then derivatize for standard lead exploration.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.

31840,Computational-guided drug design,We are driven by using chemistry to solve questions that arise in biomedicine. This often takes the form of medicinal chemistry where we are looking to make drugs to target specific diseases. As making molecules is expensive; we are using a target-oriented design strategy where we use a combination of structural biology and computational chemistry to study how known molecules interact with a protein target. We are currently using this approach on 7 different targets ranging from new cancer drugs; to autoimmune peptides; to treatments to neutralize antibiotic-resistant bacteria; COVID-19 reasearch; to studying cannabis-protein interactions to better understand the effects of the disease.We then design new molecules based on this information and do computational high-throughput screening to examine which ones we should make in the lab. Computationally; we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations; docking studies; quantum mechanical modelling; and advanced DFT-derived techniques and measurements to understand how molecules interact one with another. We use Gaussian; Amber; Gromacs; Schrodinger; Materials Studio; Rosetta; Autodock Vina and other tools to carry out these analyses. We have extensive supercomputing infrastructure to run these calculations (3600 computer cores); and access to many of the fastest graphics cards for the molecular modelling. The student will be working with the team on one of these projects; all of which have the potential of transforming how we treat disease.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.

31841,Macrocyclic Single Molecule Sensors as Diagnostic Tools,We have become very involved in supramolecular chemistry; the chemistry involved when non-covalent bonds provide well-defined structures. We are primarily interested in adapting synthetic chemistry to make previously inaccessible structures with novel activity. This is part of an extensive collaboration with teams in the US; Finland and Switzerland. The project combines developing and using new synthetic organic chemistry with the potential for biophysical and analytical chemistry; or computational and/or materials science training depending on the interests of the applicant. The work will primarily involve the functionalization of aryl groups; post-macrocylization functionalization and elaboration of pillararenes and resorcinarenes. We are then using these for a variety of really neat applications including detecting disease specific molecules (Chemical Science; 2018; 9; 1358-1367); looking to create tools to prevent bacterial growth; and making fundamental discoveries in how molecules form bonds to make large supramoleuclar networks either as crystals (Crystal Growth and Design; 2018; 18; 513-520) or in solution. We are moving into using these systems in live animal models; and in lab-on-a-chip set-ups. The project is a perfect example of our program's philosophy of using synthetic organic chemistry to do more than only total synthesis.,JohnTrant,Ontario,University of Windsor,English,2024-05-01,The ideal will student will have strong background in computational biology, biochemistry and machine learning.
