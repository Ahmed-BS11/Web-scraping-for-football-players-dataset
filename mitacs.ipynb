Highly motivated students with a desire and aptitude to learn new technologies quickly are also encouraged to apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The student can be either an environmental science major or a physicist/engineer. In the former case; work would focus on assessing performances of new sensors for the early detection of forest fire to be operated during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. Data taking will be under responsibility of Sensenet with our group playing a major role in data analysis and the student leading the effort. The other side of the project is the development of the next generation sensor. This work will involve characterizing the peformances of the sensor in the lab in a controlled atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The required skills/background of the student for this research project include strong research skills; proficiency in data collection methods; and the ability to synthesize information effectively. Prior experience in analytics and data science is not mandatory but would be beneficial. The student should have a solid understanding of research methodologies; data gathering techniques; and the ability to critically analyze and interpret information. Proficiency in literature review; survey design; data collection; and data synthesis is crucial for successfully conducting this project. Additionally; strong communication skills and attention to detail are essential for presenting the findings in a clear and concise manner.\n",
